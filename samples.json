    "TEXT": "High School DxD/ハイスクールD×D, Naruto 1. Chapter 1 The Rebirth\n\n_**Disclaimer: I do not own 'Naruto' or 'Highschool DxD'**_  \n_**Naruto the Twin Tails is a Three Part Story, but I never promised that Part Three would come AFTER Part Two.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nIn an endless sea of colors and shapes, this space of the universe was known as the Dimensional Gap. A place that was so ever changing that it was very much like looking through a kaleidoscope, yet the colors were so vivid you knew you were not looking through such a thing. Instead, a person could only marvell at it's wonder before dying. The Dimensional Gap was a place where the void was present, and any life forms without protection would die within seconds of entering this beautiful bridge between worlds.\n\nIn this world there was only a single entity that could call this place a home, and at this moment she was calmly sitting down in the nothingness of the gap. She was Ophis the Dragon-God of Infinity, and she was currently taking the form of a young girl with long black hair. Her skin was as pale as the moon, but her gray eyes had such a cold life to them. Her clothes were black with frills, but did not cover her stomach or chest. She simply wore two X-shaped black markings over her nipples to keep them hidden from the world. Instead of a skirt, shorts, or even pants, this Goddess wore none other than simple frilly bloomers to cover her bottom.\n\nShe alone could call this place her true home, but she was currently not alone in this world that she enjoyed. Another being was with her, seemingly frozen in time with how they would not move a single inch. Not a breath could be heard from the one with her, and as she stroked this beings hair the colors started to fade away to reveal his form.\n\nThis was a young man with the messiest of blond hair, and his skin was like the sun had kissed him. He was young, looking to only be 17 years old at most, while also being average height for his age. The most unique trait about him was the three whisker marks that were on his face, seeing as they stood out from the rest of his relativally normal features that you would find on handsome young man. He was well built, and his body was seemingly sculpted from the hardest of stone. Ophis ran her finger along the pectorial muscle that was showing through the young man's ripped clothes.\n\nThis was Naruto Uzumaki, the Greatest Hero that the human race had been able to produce in the last ten thousand years. No others have been able to match him sense the day that he had passed from the world of the living, and she had personally collected his soul. Sense his passing, she had spent countless hours working to restore what remained of him to his former glory. For it was his final moments that had gained her interest in him, Naruto Uzumaki had been a ninja in his life. He had been a warrior that was trained to kill and die for his village, and he personally had been given a rotten deal in life. Even from a young age, he was weak and defenceless, but he never gave up. He grew and grew to almost impossible levels of power, power that was without true match to this day. Only the most powerful of Angels, Devils, and Fallen Angels could scratch the surface of his true power.\n\nEven if somebody did have more power then him, Ophis had little doubt that Naruto would still win any fight. He was a force that did not just rely on fighting, but truly connecting his feelings and understand to other. He could make even the most demented of men switch the to side of good, and in battle he could pull monsterously effective moves out of nowhere. When most people would give up, this human would strive forward and do the impossible.\n\nThis human made an impression on her on the day of his death all those years ago, and because of that she had decided that she would restore his soul and give this man that had been dealt a bad hand in life a new hand. She was going to allow him to become a new man, or rather, she would let him reincarnate into a happier life. She did have her own reasons for this, but she knew that one day his power may be needed again. This human, whose potential had been underestimated, had never reached his full potential and if he was to do that he would no longer need to be human.\n\nOn top of Naruto's unclothed stomach was an orange object, a jacket. This jacket was neatly folded on it, and the design showing on the back was that of a circle with more circle inside of it. Under that concetrated circle were nine tear drop shaped magatama, with the entire design being in black. Each Magatama was lined up three to a row, into three rows like a square.\n\nShe knew that if she allowed him all his previous power in this new life then he would grow to arrogant in his nature, or at least he would become a wild card. That was why when she was in the process of restoring his broken soul she took his greatest power from him and transformed it into an object, this jacket held his godly power that had killed a man that could indeed slay a god. One day, this object would be made known to him and he would slowly regain what he had lost. He would regain his powers that had made him into the pressive man to her.\n\nThis was his Sacred Gear, amazing tools given to human souls so that they could allow them to do great or terrible things. She wanted this to be his, because once he was reincarnated his chance of naturally getting a Sacred Gear were zero. Only part of full humans were allowed these, and the family she picked for him to be reborn into was not human.\n\nShe wanted him to have something of his old life, but she also wanted him to truly retain the pureness she had come to respect. That was why she would not haunt him with how he once was, and the memories of those he lost. As she rebuilt this lost soul, she had been slowly removing the things from his mind that would cause him great sadness. She would lock away the memories of his powers into his Sacred Gear, and should the day come that he activates it she would start to watch him once more.\n\nAs it was, she was using most of her power keeping the one she hates the most out of the Gap. As it was, she would only be able to hold out her strength only so much longer before she was forces to reincarnate him without him waking up first, and should her enemy come into this plane she would be forced to leave, for she would not have the power to get him out on her own.\n\nShe felt him stir ever so lightly, as he breathed the first breath in his many years of death. This was the breath that she knew would be the one to grant him new life, but yet he showed no signs of waking.\n\nFinally, as a sign from above the orange sun mark on the palm of his right hand started to glow once more with life. Naruto Uzumaki jerked awake once more, but found that he was unable to move of his own free will.\n\n'Where... where am I?' Naruto questioned weakly in his own mind, for he was without much of his memory at this time. The years passing having gotten him to forget much of what even Ophis did not touch, a clean slate given to a hero that was undeserved by the masses. Ophis would only do this for him and only him, and she placed her hand over his heart and got his attention.\n\n\"Uzumaki Naruto, you are in my home. I, have decided to grant you new life. I, have watched over you for so long now Uzumaki Naruto. You were a great hero once upon a time Uzumaki Naruto, but you were not given the life you should have had.\" Ophis spoke smoothly, not speaking anymore than she had to. She spoke what was needed to get the point across and not a single thing more, she felt a shaking hand touch the side of her face, before moving to her hair.\n\n\"Such... nice... hair... as black... as night.\" Naruto spoke the only thing he could think of as he gazed up at her, his hand finding the strength to move for the first time in so long. His eyes went to the sun on his palm, but he found more comfort in looking at this beautiful girl's hair. Ophis looked down at Naruto without showing her emotion, seeing as she made her hair this color because she licked the color black.\n\n\"Uzumaki Naruto, this is why you are being given a new life. You, are a champion that came before your time. I, have seen your soul, and your soul will soon find happiness that you were denied.\" Ophis spoke once more as snakes made out of the shadows of her powers came from her skin, and despite the texture looking like that of ink they slowly crawed over Naruto's flesh and sank into his body. The jacket also glowing and sinking into his flesh as well, and right on the inside of the orange sun glowing on his palm appeared a second symbol inside the first one.\n\nNow that orange sun had a black infinity symbol inside it, the glowing sun and the black infinity. One fit him perfectly, while the other showed that she had a hand in his reincarnation. This was also her blessing to him, but would not become active just yet.\n\nOphis closed her eyes, before she felt Naruto start to vanish from her lap.\n\nJust as he fully vanished, she felt the barrier she had been keeping up break.\n\nThe Great Red had invaded her home.\n\n_**[With Naruto]**_\n\n\"Kaa-san, look at them... aren't they beautiful?\" A young woman wearing a black kimono asked as she held two small babies into her large chest. Her pitch black hair fell down to the middle of her back, and her golden eyes glowed with love for the two newborn babies in her arms. Her pale skin had a hint of red on it from how much happiness she was feeling at seeing the birth of her younger siblings. The two black cat ears on her head were twitching in excitement, while her two tails were moving swiftly behind her in joy.\n\nEach child in her arms were both beautiful in their own right, the one in her left arm was the older sibling of the two babies. This was on a cute little baby girl, and like herself she had cat ears coming from her head. Only these ears were white, just like the small tuff of hair on her head. Her eyes were opened and looking around everywhere, showing that they were a golden yellow color like her's were. Her skin was pale like Kuroka's, and her little white tail was moving like no tomorrow.\n\nThe second one, the youngest sibling of the trio, was a little baby boy. Unlike either sister, this boy had naturally tan skin, like he was born under the sun. Three small whisker marks stood out on each cheek, giving him the look of a cute little kitten. His tail was wrapped around her forearm, and she saw that there was a small tuff of pure white hair on his head. It was white just like his sister's hair, but instead of a single color for eyes she noticed that he had two colors. Not two colors exactly, but she was able to see that one second they would turn blue, before they went back to a golden yellow.\n\nThe mother of these two babies was currently laying against the side of a tree, and she wore a blood stained white kimono. Her skin was beyond pale, and her white haire feel down to her breasts. Her dull yellow eyes peered out from her curtain of hair, looking at the children she had birthed with a weak smile on her face. She didn't have much strength left in her, and she was bleeding out fast. She knew that she didn't have long to live, but sadly for her she had not been able to get help fast enough to find a good place to birth her children.\n\nShe was a Nekoshou, which meant that she was a third class citizen in the Underworld. Most of the Devils would ignore their cries for help, with very few truly helping them succeed in life. Sadly, they were also a poor family because of how hard it was to find a job in the Underworld these days.\n\n\"Kuroka-chan... what are their... names?\" The mother of the twins asked with a smile, knowing that her eldest daughter would pick out a good name for them. Kuroka got down on the ground and moved her mother's hair out of her face with a sad smile. She knew that she had been born with a weak body, her mother had always been a rather weak person when it came to physical labor. She had nearly died givinhg birth to her awhile back, so birthing another child, let alone two, was a death sentence to her.\n\n\"This one is going to be Shirone because of her white hair, and how cute her little sounds are... I do not know what to name my little brother though. Why don't you name him Kaa-san, as your last act you should name him?\" Kuroka offerd kindly to the dying woman, knowing that deep in her heart that she wanted to name at least one of the children before she passed onto the afterlife. The woman moved her head up to look at the little baby boy, before she coughed out a glop of blood onto her stomach. She started to go into a coughing fit, and she got her hand up to her mouth near the end. Kuroka watched with small tears in her eyes at how her mother was dying in front of her eyes, but with her happy smile never leaving her face.\n\nShe watched her mother take her hand away from her mouth, and she looked at the blood in her hand for a moment. She watched as the blood all around her hand began to move towards the middle of her palm, bending and moving along the pale skin until the blood touched in the middle of her palm. Her eyes widened when she saw the perfect name for her youngest child in her blood.\n\nShe glanced at Kuroka, before she used as much strength as she could to moved her hand up and show her oldest child what rested on her palm. A single design, something that had come at the perfect moment. The blood she had coughed up had formed the design of a whirlpool on the middle of her hand.\n\n\"Na... Naruto... he will be named... after the most power... kind of whirlpool... a... maelstrom. Tell them... that I don't... regret giving birth to them.\" The nameless mother of three said before her head slumbed forward and her arms touched the ground with a thump. This woman, who had used her final moment to tell her children that she loved them in her own way, had died in the middle of the forest with a smile on her face. Thus was a mother's love, to give her life for her children at the drop of a hat. She had been rpoud of herself in her final moments for having lived such a happy life. Having raised her eldest child, having birthed her youngest two, and having named her last.\n\nShe had died a happy woman.\n\n\"Don't worry Kaa-san, Shirone-chan and Naruto-chan will be safe. I will protct them with my life if I have to, no matter what I will always put them before myself... just like you did.\" Kuroka said as the tears finally broke through her eyes lashes and fell down her pretty face. She wouldn't have been this way if her mother had not said something so beautiful in her final moments. She kissed her younger siblings on the foreheads just as they started to cry loudly, as if knowing that their mother was dead.\n\nKuroka made a promise to herself at that moment, an oath that she was using her tears to bind her to.\n\nFrom this day forward, she would make sure that Shirone and Naruto would be happy. No matter the cost to herself, she would raise these two with as much love as she could. Her mother died bringing them into this world, and she would die to protect them from this world if she had to do it. That was the job of the eldest after all, to love and protect her younger siblings even if they grow to hate her.\n\nLife would be hard, it has always been, but if they were a family, then maybe things wouldn't be so bad.\n\nThere was a saying that true love conquers all, and what love is truer than that of the bonds made between siblings?\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Like I said before, this is what COULD have happened in Naruto the Twin Tails. There are things that will not show up in this one, and things that will. Certain Events won't happen, and some might. Just count on one thing, it will not put the Twin Tails to shame. It will show a softer side to the story though hence why 'The Pure'.**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Silent King of the Dead/Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_\n\n\n\t2. Chapter 2 Th Deal\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"So cold Grayfia-tan.\" A handsome man with long red hair said as he rubbed the side of his head with his hand. By looks he seemed to be in his mid twenties, and his skin was more fair than you would usually see in a guy. His bright green eyes showed plenty of kindness in them, and he wore golden armor over his body that gave him an extremely regal appearance to him. He was Sirzechs Lucifer (Gremory) and he was one of the Four Satans of the Underworld. Sirzechs was currently taking a walk down into one of the cities with his wife and servant Grafia Lucifer.\n\nGrayfia Lucifuge was a high class woman with silver hair and silver eyes that seemed to take on a more seriuous outlook on life, which seemed to be there for the purpose of balancing out her husbands stupidity. She was scene wearing a maid's uniform, and she was frowning lightly at her husband. In truth, she really did love him dearly, but in public she had told him many times that his reputation was at stake by treating her with to much affection. Currently, he and she were trying to find something for his younger sister. Her birthday was coming up, and being the Sis-con that he is, Sirzechs always tried his very hardest to get his younger sister the most amazing gifts possible.\n\n\"We are here to find Rias-sama a gift Sirzechs-sama, please remember this reason.\" Grayfia pointed out politely, and she blinked with her husband when they noticed that something small was running towards their direction. Sirzechs was the one that caught what the small figure was when he noticed a small white hair child covered in dirt running towards them with an armful of bread in his arms, and by the tatters his clothes were in it was easy to tell that he was homeless. Yet, his body was very healthy, and not underfed like that of the usual homeless children.\n\nThe boy noticed them, and he seemed to startled for a second before he heard a commotion coming from nearby.\n\n'A Nekomata? Well this is a rare surprise, I thought that none of them were left.' Sirzechs thought with a small smile on his face when he saw the yung Nekoshou, and a male one at that. Male Nekomata were so rare these days, that even in the already rare Nekoshou race, they were considered more valuable than ten castles worth of treasure these days. Any collector of Youkai woud be having an orgasm just by looking at a fine specimen like this one, healthy, young, and with a flair of life. They were both surprised when the boy looked behind him in a panic, before he started to use one clawed hand to climbs up the wall to a nearby building. Just in time to, because moments later when he was out of site a middle aged man with an average appearance came from around the corner.\n\n\"Damnit! The brat got away again, this is the forth time this week! Why don't those beasts ever steal from somebody else!? You here me you little brat, if you do this again I will catch you and gut you myself!\" The man shouted out in frustration at having his merchandise stolen once more by the brat that had just climbed up to the roof of the building. The couple were able to see white hair and white cats ears sticking up from the edge of the roof, and neither really decided to tell the man that the thief that had stolen his bread was close by. It would seem that the man had given up anyway because he went back where he came from with an angry grunt.\n\nGrayfia was about to call out to the child on the roof, before she felt somebody bump into her from behind and touch her rear end. She and her husband turned around to 'lecture' about how molesting the wife of a Satan was a bad idea, before they both saw a second white haired child sitting on the ground while rubbing her head. This child was obviously a girl, and besides the pale skin she looked just like the white haired boy with the bread. The girl shook her head, before she stood up and started to run away before either Grayfia or Sirzechs could say anything to her. She ran behind the corner, and the white haired boy vanished from the rooftop.\n\n\"Twin Nekomata? Well, this is a lucky day it would seem. I just know that today I am going to pick out the best birthday present for Rias-tan!\" Sirzechs said with a good amount of excitement, and his wife sighed lightly and prepared to check how much she had in her purse for this perfect gift. She blinked in shock when she saw that the straps to her purse had been cut completely by something, and the end of her purse where she kept all the money had completely vanished.\n\n\"Sirzechs-sama, it would seem that we have been robbed by a small child.\" Grayfia pointed out with an annoyed, a very annoyed, tone to her voice that spoke volumes for how angry she really was. Sirzechs only smiled lightly and looked into the direction that the small children had run off in, because it would seem that they had been robbed by the same people that had been robbing the people of this city for awhile now. There had been reports of small robberies happening in this city, but never anything too serious. The most that has never been reported stolen was food and clothing.\n\n\"You know, I may have just found the perfect gift for Rias.\" Sirzechs said with complete honesty as he walked in the direction that the children had last been seen by them. Grayfia caught on to what he was going on about, and she sighed very lightly but couldn't help but agree with his logic in this.\n\n\"Very well then Sirzechs-sama.\" Grayfia said with a light bow, before she followed behind her husband as he took the last known path that the children had used. She was still rather ashamed that she had not noticed that her purse had been stolen from her until after she checked for how much money she had. It was a blow to her pride that somebody had stolen from her, and frankly it showed that she was getting lax with her sensing ability if a child hadmanaged to steal something so important from her.\n\n_**[With Naruto and Shirone]**_\n\nIt had been five years since the twin Nekoshou had been born, and for the most part life had been fufilling for them. Naruto and Shirone had each been well raised by their older sister Kuroka, and she had made sure that they would have everything they needed. ecerything had been great for them, or at least as great as things can be when you are homeless. Sure, they had to steal for survival, but that was a small matter to the siblings. It wasn't like they were going to be sold things at the regular price anyway, so stealing was their only real option in life.\n\nFrom a young age Naruto and Shirone were both taught how to steal without getting caught, and using their senses to the limit so that they could avoid being catching them. If they were caught then Kuroka would come in and knock the devil that caught them out, before she robbed them blind and they all went to safety. Today was actually a pretty big haul for the trio of siblings as Naruto and Shirone ran towards Kuroka as fast as their little legs could carry them. Lately Kuroka had been disappearing without telling them about it, and when she came back she would smell like blood. Naruto and Shirone never thought anything of it, but they were curious to what she did when they stole things.\n\n\"Onee-chan! I have bread nya!\" Naruto shouted childishly as he ran up to his giggling sister when she saw that he was having trouble keeping his balance with all the bread he had gotten. She smiled lightly at him, and the youngest of the group beamed when he saw her smile at him. He placed the bread in her lap\n\n\"I got a purse...\" Shirone said with a very small blush on her face. To them money was a lot less important than food, so the winner of today's small contest was obviously Naruto since he had managed to get enough bread for them to have a decent lunch. Since they didn't even really used money, most of the time they would just use it as a method to help start a fire. Then once they had a fire going they would only need to gather sticks. It was rather funny that when they got money, they literally threw that money away by burning it. Shirone placed the purse next to Kuroka, and the eldest sister place both of the twins on her lap with a cat-like grin on her face.\n\n\"Both of you did very well, but it would seem that you still messed up slightly nya.\" Kuroka hinted when she noticed that somebody had entered their territoy. Both Naruto and Shirone blinked in confusion when they heard her say that, and looking around childishly they could see anyone following them. Kuroka frowned when she felt how powerful both of the people that were nearby were, since neither of them would be somebody that she woujld stand a chance against while protecting two children. She looked at the two children, before she smiled lightly and pressed them against her chest.\n\nThen her eyes sharpened and she struck both of her younger siblings in the back of the neck, knocking them both out before they could even react to her hitting them. She stood up and safely placed her siblings against the tree, before she stood in front of them with sharp eyes that pierced through the darkness of the forest they were in.\n\n\"There goes the element of surprise.\" Her apparent enemy stated as she saw the surrent Lucifer and his wife come out of the shadows now that they were obviously caught. He had a sheepish expression on his face, while his wife placed the tips of her fingers against her head while shaking her cranium slightly to show what she thought oif her husband ruining the element of surprise.\n\n\"I didn't sense your power, I smelled you out. Not even you can hide your scent Satan Red nya, and my sense of smell is too powerful for you to trick nya.\" Kuroka said with a frown on her face, her danger senses not going off yet for some reason. It was like somewhere in her she didn't register this guy as a threat, or at least that he wasn't going to attack them in cold blood without letting them put up a fight. That, or he liked children and didn't want to kill the one raising the two children behind her.\n\n\"Nekoshou it is then, I can't sense you at all.\" Grayfia pointed out as she tried to sense for Kuroka's aura, but was surprised when she found nothing. She could fell the aura of the two knocked out children, but the aura of the one standing in front of them was so well hidden that it was like it wasn't even there at all. They weren't being supressed either, but it was like they didn't even exist.\n\n\"You noticed me hiding my aura with Senjutsu then, no surprise there that the 'strongest queen' would be able to tell that I was a Nekoshou nya. That leaves one question though, why are you here?\" Kuroka asked with narrowed eyes, her yellow eyes glowing with power waiting to be unleashed. She could take out the silver haired devil, but not Sirzechs. A Satan Level oppponent would be far to much for her to fight at this moment in time, but an Ultimate Class Devil was just in her range of ability. One good hit was all she would need, if she would get that hit remained to be seen.\n\n\"Now now, don't be so hostile. We don't want any trouble, but we do need to get our money back.\" Sirzechs said with a silent wish that nothing got started over this. He didn't want to get the little kids to get hurt in the conflict, so he would try and play the mediater. He could alreasy tell that Kuroka's and Grayfia's opposite personalities would create friction between them. In the last few years, it had been comfirmed that Kuroka had been been killing dozens of devils around the area for some unknown reason. He guessed he got his answer from how she was defending the two smaller children behind her.\n\n\"Take your money and leave nya.\" Kuroka said as she kicked the purse over to them, she had no use for the money anyway other than for starting a fire. Grayfia caught her purse, before she looked to see if it could be fixed. She sighed in relief when she realized that her purse would have to be repaired, but it was fixable. Kuroka's eyes narrowed when she saw that neither of the devils were moving from their spots, and they didn't look like they were about to leave either.\n\n\"Thank you for returning that money, but our business isn't finished yet. You see, we couldn't help but notice that these two had to steal to live. I will be honest with you when I ask you if this is the kind of life you want them to live.\" Sirzechs pointed out with a smal wave towards Naruto and Shirone. Kuroka charged at Sirzechs with rage in her eyes, before she jumped back when she noticed that he was leaking out his family ability. The black and red Power of Destruction that originally came from the Bael family, but was later obtained when Lord Gremory married a women from the Bael family. Such a power was just as deadly at her Senjutsu, both were pretty much one hit kills to most opponents that didn't have experience fighting against it, or very high resistances.\n\nShe was not ready to fight something like this, not without a plan for it that is.\n\n\"There is no other way to live for us, devils like you have it easy. You were BORN with a high status, and society looked to you as the future nya. We are considered to be the lowest part of low, and have to do anything we can to get uyp in the world nya. Yet, we are still happy. You have nothing that you can do to help us.\" Kuroka said firmly, knowing that she wouldn't be able to go with this person. Her mother wanted her to protect them, it was part of her dying wish so of course she was going to do everything in her power to make sure that they stayed as safe as possible. She was tempted, but she knew this could be a trap to take her out without her putting up a fight in the moment of surprise.\n\n\"I may not know what it means to work my way up from the bottom, but I do know that being raised as thieves will come to hurt those two in the end. They are innocent kids that have a hard life, and I want them to escape from that kind of life. You are no doubt a good sister to them, and I am not asking you to give them to me. That is why I have an offer for you.\" Sirzechs stated with a stern appearance that seemed to be a rare thing on his face when in private company. He didn't want kids to be punished because of how they were raised, and if he was honest with himself he had some selfish reasons for this as well.\n\nNekoshou were the most powerful breed of Nekomata, and while Nekomata had the potential for Senjutsu and Youjutsu, the Nekoshou had the potential to completely master Youjutsu and Senjutsu. The Nekoshou were a High-Level Youkai species, and even in his long life these three were the only ones that he had ever seen. They were just that rare, and they were a mostly female race. Finding a Male Nekoshou was something that he couldn't simply pass up. If a normal female Nekoshou was worth ten castles worth of treasure, then the male of the species was easily ten times that much.\n\nSenjutsu Masters had the potential to also harness their own Touki, and with that Touki they could enhance their speed, strength, and durability to amazing levels. The fact that they were also able to naturally use Chakra, an energy that had a small amount of light properties, made them dangrous to devils. Not to mention that in theory a Nekoshou that was turned into a Nekoshou/Devil Hybrid would be able to have a high resistance to Light Based abilties.\n\n\"An offer nya?\" Kuroka asked in surprise, this was something she hadn't seen coming. Grayfia was looking her her beloved with an expression of confusion as well, she had only been aware of him wanting to get their money back.\n\n\"Yes, if you agree to these conditions then I promise that you and your family will be able to live a life of relative comfort. You won't have to worry about being attacked randomly, and you shall have a bed to sleep in each night.\" Sirzechs tempted lightly, while the idea started to tempt Kuroka even further. This was starting to sound too good to be true, as far as she knew no devil was kind enough to offer others something without something in return. Somebody from the Gremory family should be no different, no matter how nice the family was rumored to be.\n\nThey were devils after all.\n\n\"What is the catch nya?\" Kuroka asked with her arms crossed under her impressive rack, and Sirzechs nodded slightly at how she wasn't falling for how tempting he was trying to mak the offer seem.\n\n\"Simple, you will work under the Gremory family as out personal spy. You will be sent out on missions when we ask, and you will be expected to remain a mystery. That means that if you are caught, the Gremory will deny every having anything to do with you. My family will cut all ties with you. The second thing is that I would like for your siblings to become a part of my Rias-tan's peerage when she gets her Evil Piece set.\" Sirzechs stated with a small smile on his face. Getting Rias two potentially amazing pieces would be an amazing gift for her birthday, not to mention the fact that the family wouldn't have to steal anymore... unless Kuroka was ordered to do that. The two children would get a friend that was only two years older than them, and Rias would get two rare friends/servants/pets depending on how she saw them.\n\nKuroka was torn between chosing her own desire for a free life, or the safety and happiness of her younger siblings. She could trade away all of their freedom for a happy life that wouldn't be completely filled with danger, or she could tell SIrzechs to stikc his offer up his ass and potentially damn them all in the future. They were Nekoshou, a near extinct species of Nekomata. They were most likely the last of their kind, and if they died out then that was it for their race.\n\nNot to mention if something happened to her, then nobody would be there for her precious siblings.\n\nIt was a gamble, she could do this and make sure her family was safe, or toss the offer away and throw away this chance of safety. The choice was obvious, but she just didn't want to make it. She had swore on her mother's unmarked grave that she would protect her siblings no matter the cost to herself. She said unmarked, because if anyone discovered that the grave held a Nekoshou in it they would break it. It was easier to have the location memorized, than the rebuilt it every time they went to visit.\n\n'Naruto-chan, Shirone-chan... forgive me for what I am going to do.' Kuroka thought in her mind as she took a breath to calm herself. With determination in her eyes, and a heart that was prepared for her sibling's anger, she gazed at the devils and decided upon her answer. She was placing everything on the line with her choice.\n\nShe hoped that her mother could forgive her.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Updated Next: Naruto the Silent King of the Dead**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t3. Chapter 3 The Answer\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Let me get this straight, you want me to betray my cute little siblings trust just so that your little brat will get two rare pets nya?\" Kuroka asked with narrowed eyes towards Sirzechs. Her answer would completely depend on how he answered her, and if it was a good answer then she wouldn't mind allowing her siblings to join this girl's peerage. If the answer was bad, she would completely reject the offer and tell him to stuff it up his ass. Grayfia was looked between the siblings with a cautious gaze, making sure to keep her eye on the sleeping siblings just in case they woke up.\n\n\"Huh?! OH! You misunderstand, you see, if I just took your family in then their would be many political responces to this. You see, my little Rias-tan doesn't really have any friends in her general age group, and I think the same could be said for your little ones. If they become hers then they would automatically get the protection of the Gremory family. You will be paid for your services, and it isn't like they will be treated badly. You can see them anytime you want to, but they will belong to Rias. I just thought it was sad that the last family of Nekoshou had a bad life, and this is an offer than benefits us both.\" Sirzechs said with his hands waving in a way to keep her cool. Yes, he wanted to give the twins to Rias as a gift that would one day become powerful servants, but it wasn't like this was a completely selfish desire of his. He figured that the twins would be able to play with Rias, and as they grew up together they would be less likely to be seen as servants. They would be like family to Rias, because the Gremory in her was strong. She would just love to have two little friends to play with... and watch anime with.\n\nYeah, he blamed himself for that one. He brought her back one DVD of Sailor Moon, and then his little sister starts her road to becoming an Otaku.\n\n\"I will be paid nya? Hmm, and they won't be hurt?\" Kuroka asked with a quick glance at her siblings. She wasn't as worried about Naruto getting hurt, because he was a tough little guy. He could take as much punishment as he possible could and then come back for more. Those times she watched him secretely train with that strange Youjutsu of his proved that he could take a hit when his own moves backfired on him. Not to mention he had an amazing healing factor, and a very high amount of chakra in his body. Shirone on the other hand wasn't nearly as strong, but she seemed to have an amazing ability when it came to learning. She didn't want them getting hurt, but either way avoiding pain was impossible.\n\n\"They will be hurt eventually. If they were to join her Peerage, then they would no doubt go through a Rating Game. If they were to do that, then they would get hurt. It is very rare for anyone to die in a Rating Game though, and a great team of medics is usually there to take care of injuries. Can you say they won't be hurt by the people that placed a price on your head 'Kuroka the Black Hellcat' or how about 'Demon Cat Kuroka' because eventually people WILL come after them to get to you.\" Sirzechs stated in a matter of fact voice, while Kuroka winced. She had a lot of enemies that would just love to get their hands on her siblings and do unspeakable things to thejm if it meant hurting her. Almost nobody among her enemies would dare mess with one of the still standing 72 Pillar families. Doing that was akin to suicide in most cases, and messing with the Gremory was something even she wouldn't do.\n\nThe Gremory was the family that had managed to gain the Bael clan's Power of Destuction, and in this family were two confirmed users of this power. The mother of the two children, and the man standing in front of her. One of the Four Satans and the one that was considered to be one of the most powerful ones. Then there was his wife, somebody that was nearly on par with an Satan Class Devil. After that was the fact that the Gremory family were allied with the Sitri family, and if you messed with the Gremory you were messing with the Bael. The Bael were considered the most powerful family in the Underworld. Not to mention that the Sitri family also had a Satan in it in the form of Serafall Leviathan.\n\nIn the end, it was a very poor choice to mess with the Gremory. That was akin to taking on 3 Satan class level devils, the Gremory family, the Sitri family, the Bael family, the Power of Destruction, as well as any secret weapons they had that weren't well known.\n\nBasically, only those with death wishes or those that were sure of victory would even dare to take on the Gremory with how much back up they had.\n\n\"Think carefully Kuroka-san, or you may make a choice you will regret. With the backing of the Gremory, your siblings will have better lives. One day if they ascend through the ranks they can own their own land, and will be able to gain political power that a Nekoshou has never had before. Can you really hold them back from getting a good live because you don't agree with the methods, or you want to selfishly keep them to yourself?\" Grayfia questioned with narrowed eyes as she gave Kuroka a bone chilling look that sent guilt right to the depths of her soul. The way they were talking was making her feel like she was the bad guy for wanting to keep her siblings to herself. If they were speaking the truth, and her abilties were saying they were, then Shirone and Naruto would be much better off living at the Gremory Castle. They could have a great life, and one day they could gain a greater amount of freedom despite the fact they were going to be pretty much slaves for awhile.\n\nNekoshou lived bad lives because of the danger devils considered them, but if they gained a high status then they would be proving that Nekoshou meant devils no harm. Their race would thrive, and be reborn once more. They would be better than ever, and that was her ultimate goal in life. She wanted the Nekoshou to flourish again, and despite the trade-off being her freedom, this was a great way to get started on her goal.\n\n\"... Okay... BUT, if they are mistreated you better expect me to take my pound of flesh nya.\" Kuroka threatened the two, before Sirzechs nodded. If anyone ever hurt Rias he would be very much the same way, so he could understand exactly where she was coming from. The burden of being an lder sibling was one that should not be taken lightly, nor looked down upon. It was a very demanding job, and both elder siblings took it very seriously... for different reasons. Kuroka promised her mother than she would look after them, while Sirzechs didn't know the hardships of truly having to raise his sibling.\n\n\"Very well then! That is great news, but is there anything I can do for you to seal the deal?\" Sirzechs asked one final thying before the deal was sealed, and Kuroka instantly knew the answer to that. It was the one thing that he could do that she would sell her very soul for, besides her siblings lives, and it was something she couldn't do on her own.\n\n_**-One Week Later-**_\n\n_Yurika the White Cat - A Loving Mother, a Great Cat, and a Selfless Soul _\n\nKuroka stood in front of her mother's new grave that was located in the Gremory graveyard, a place that her grave stone wouldn't be destroyed. With this she had finally been able to give her mother a proper send off that was fitting of such a great woman that had died bring two children into this world. Kuroka was wearing a black hooded robe over her normal clothes, and it was in the middle of the night.\n\n\"Naruto-chan, Shi...\" Kuroka started as she adressed her siblings while standing next to them. Instead of the scraps of clothes they had been wearing before, now they wore real clothes. Naruto was wearing a simple t shirt and shorts, while Shirone wore a small yellow dress. She didn't get to finish her sentence though when she felt Shirone give her a now neutral look that spoke volumes of how annoyed she was at her elder sister.\n\n\"That isn't my name anymore... I lost that name when you sold my life away.\" The girl that had abandoned her name said with a heated tone, something that Kuroka couldn't help but wince at. The girl that was formally named Shirone had taken the news that they would soon be little more than playthings for a girl pretty hard. Her once expressive face had lost almost all emotion, and it was clear that she was not happy with Kuroka. This was something that she also couldn't fault her little sister one, because she would be angry if her freedom was sold away as well.\n\n\"Onee-chan... I'm not mad at you nya.\" Naruto said after a few moments as he rubbed his arm and she smiled at him softly. She could always count on Naruto to look on the bright side of things, no matter how horrible life had been he would always smile and act like nothing was wrong. He wasn't even hiding his emotions, it was like he had lived a previous life before now and in that life he had gained a complete mastery of his anger. It was something that she knew would come in handy when his body was strong enough to handle to strain of Senjutsu.\n\n\"Have you met with that Rias girl yet nya?\" Kuroka asked with a slightly sad look, before she smiled when Naruto smiled and started to nod just like his chilish nature told him to.\n\n\"Uhuh! She is really nice, but a little weird nya. I thought devils were suppose to be ubber meanies, but she was REALLY nice... I really like her pretty hair nya.\" Naruto said after a moment when he remembered the girls extremely deep shade of red hair. He didn't know why, but he really liked unique hair colors like that.\n\n\"... She named me Koneko.\" The now renamed Koneko said without emotion, and once more Kuroka winced. She had been the person to give Koneko the name Shirone, so to hear that the name she had gifted her sister with had been replaced was a serious blow to her. She had to admit that the name really fit her though.\n\n'I she doesn't put nya at the end of her sentences anymore... she must really be angry at me.' Kuroka thought sadly, before she felt like slapping herself when she saw Naruto's face fall as well. She didn't know why, but Naruto was VERY sensative to people's negative emotions. If she felt sad, then that sadness would in turn affect Naruto. She had no clue why, but he seemed to have some very strange abilities that would seem to randomly pop up sometimes. She was even more surprised that he didn't seem to notice that anything was wrong with him, so she didn't bother bringing it up.\n\n\"Rias-chan says that she is getting her Evil Piece thingy next years, and we can join her pe... pear... peerage then nya!\" Naruto explained with a light smile on his face when he noticed that Kuroka had cheered herself up. Kuroka was actually happy that her siblings had a almost a whole year before they would become apart of Rias' peerage. Kuroka watched as Koneko suddenly started to walk away with Naruto following after her and talking to her about everything and nothing at the same time. Kuroka looked at her mother's new grave before a tear fell down her cheek.\n\nShe could never say how sorry she was for what she did, and she could only hope that her mother would forgive her.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Some of you need to 'Look Underneath the Underneath' because there are more than one reason for why characters do what they do. **_  \n_**Next to be Updated: Naruto the Strange Mage / This fic again**_  \n_**I will begin in Questions Omake at chapter 5, because that is when the story truly starts.**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t4. Chapter 4 The Queen\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Chapters for this should start to increase in length.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nIt had been five years since Naruto and the newly named Koneko had been given a home at the Gremory castle. These five years had been good for the small children of now ten years old. They were well fed, and their 'owner' was truly a very nice girl. Both Naruto and Koneko still got along very well with each other, but Koneko only ever got mad at Naruto when he brought up that she should try and forgive Kuroka. Koneko was very stubborn on the fact that Kuroka was in the wrong by selling them away, while Naruto didn't really care.\n\nRight now though Naruto was sitting in the garden on the Gremory castle with one Rias Gremory. Rias was a very young, for a devil, girl at the age of 12 years old. Her red hair was a little bit lighter than her brothers, but still being a blood red shade of crimson. Her skin was a healthy pale thanks to her heritage, and she could pass off for a english woman thanks to her skin color. Her eyes were a warm green color that Naruto found just as pretty as her hair, and finally as the daughter of a Gremory and a Bael she had inherited the Power of Destruction just like her elder brother. Right now though she was wearing a black dress that went down to her thighs, and her growing breasts were pressed up against the back of Naruto's head.\n\nThis was their favorite bonding activity to do together, Naruto would sit in Rias lap and use a small watering can to water their own little garden while she would just enjoy holding her friend. Rias' happy personality would spread and make Naruto's own mood much happier, because with his growing empathy abilities he was now not only sensing negative emotions, but also positive ones. It was a blessing just as much as it was a curse, because if Naruto was around a large group of people feeling negative emotions then he could get physically sick from the over exposure to negativity. He was also personally influenced by heavy or strong emotions, which was why he liked to stay around Koneko or Rias. Koneko had a small amount of emotion in her, and she was his sister, so he didn't get much feedback from her. Rias was just usually a happy person, so he liked being around her happiness.\n\n\"Hey Naruto-kun, a few days ago I found a girl that I wanted to make apart of my peerage . Right now she is being moved into a room at the Gremory castle. I think you and Koneko-chan will really like her.\" Rias informed Naruto while running her hand through his spiky locks of white hair. Naruto and Koneko had both been made apart of her peerage a few years back, and frankly she was surprised to learn that Naruto took a very powerful piece just to turn him into a member of her peerage.\n\nThe Evil Piece system was designed much like the game of chest. There was the King of each Peerage, in this case that was Rias. From there you had the a single Queen piece, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights, and eight Pawns. That was also the importance of the system. A Queen piece was worth nine pawns, a Rook piece was worth five pawns, both Bishop and Knight pieces were worth three pawns, and finally the Pawn was the lowest piece. Of course, that wasn't to say they were the weakest either. Each piece was given the ability of it's chess piece, and enhancement to their abilities that would come in handy during a fight.\n\nThe Rook had amazing defence and strength.  \nThe Bishop was granted even greater magical reserves.  \nThe Knight was gifted with amazing speed.  \nThe Queen was given the combined strengths of the Rook, Bishop, and Knight.  \nFinally, the Pawn had the ability to temporarily gain a promotion to any of the higher pieces besides King.\n\nSometimes people would take more than one piece to reincarnate into a Devil, or Devil/Nekoshou hybrid in the cases of Naruto and Koneko. Koneko had taken a single Rook to turn into a member of Rias' peerage. That meant that she was worth at most 5 pawns, which was a nice first addition to her peerage. Naruto on the other hand was comfirmed to be more valuable than his younger sister when she was unable to turn him with any of the other pieces. She had even tried to use ALL eight Pawns to turn him. Finally, she learned that Naruto be turned by nothing less than her most powerful piece.\n\nThe Queen, and as the Queen of her peerage Naruto had been given all the strengths of the Rook, Bishop, and Knight. That made him the most powerful person in the peerage besides her, or when a Pawn promoted to the Queen position during battle. She was curious as to what was inside him that caused him to be worth such a valuable piece, but she figured it had to do with the strange symbol that would sometimes show up on his right palm. Sadly, it would never appear long enough for anyone to get more than a passing glance at it.\n\n\"Is she the person I felt coming into the castle nya? What piece are you going to use for her?\" Naruto wondered out loud for a second, not really caring to stop using his verbal tic. He didn't know why, but he felt like as a person he should always have a verbal tic. It just felt right to him to have a verbal tic, but that was besides the point. Naruto had indeed felt a source of some negative emotion, and at the same time positive emotion come into the castle that he hadn't felt before. If he had to describe each person based on their usual emotions then Rias felt like a warm sandy beach, Sirzechs felt like a calm moonlight, Kuroka felt like a happy cat, Koneko had no real feeling to her most of the time, Lord Gremory and Lady Gremory had a warm/cold thing going on with them, Grayfia hadn't been around lately so he forgot what she felt like. There were many other people and servant, but he still knew each of them.\n\nThis person felt more like the flavor he got when Rias got him a Sour Apple soda. It was both sweet and sour at the same time, but with a light focus on the sweet, but what you noticed more was the sour. It was like a person that both liked to inflict pain, and feel pain at the same time. It confused him greatly.\n\n\"I don't really know, but I was thinking of either using my Mutated Bishop or using as many Pawns as it will take. If she can promote during battle then she can become a Queen or another piece, and the more Pawns it takes the more of a Base Stat boost she will get depending on how many it takes to turn her. With the Mutated Bishop pieces though she will get a very high amount of magical power.\" Rias mused to Naruto and herself as she considered what she was going to turn her newest friend into. She had little doubt that the Bishop would be a good piece for her with what her current abilities suggested. The woman that she had come across while on a trip to the human world had an already very high amount of magical power, and she knew how to properly use it already. Yet the normal Bishop wouldn't be good enough to turn her, and she wantd to save the Mutated Bishop for somebody with a powerful Sacred Gear.\n\nMutated Pieces were rare pieces that only one out of every ten Devils got when they were given their Evil Pieces. Rias got very lucky by getting one, because they could turn people that were worth a lot of pieces with just one piece. Sadly, Naruto's body had also rejected that piece for some reason. Mutated Pieces weren't perfect though, because like regular Evil Pieces they were unable to turn Gods, Buddhas, and Dragon Gods. Not everything was know about them either, and it was said that the boost somebody got from a Mutated Piece was twice as powerful as the boost from a normal Evil Piece.\n\n\"How about the Rook? If you want them to use magic as their main form of battle, then that woujld leave them weak to physical damage. Wouldn't it be better to give them a defence, and then just have them train their magic to a high level? I mean, just because somebody is a Rook doesn't mean that they can't fight with magic nya?\" Naruto questioned Rias with his head tilting to the side. He never understood why people seemed to think that just because somebody was physically strong because they were a Rook that they couldn't fight maily with their magic. After all, you could make your magical talent grow by training with it hard enough. Rias blinked in surprise at not thinking of that before this point, but she had to admit that it would be a very good tactic for the element of surprise.\n\nIf people got used to somebody only using magic to fight, then they would forget that somebody was physically strong. That would lead to them trying to get in close to attack, and that would be a fatal mistake when you learned that they were just as strong as they were magically strong.\n\n\"Hmmm, I really like that. With a Rook being worth five pawns there is also the chance that it will be nough to turn her. Very good idea Naruto-kun.\" Rias praised Naruto while she started to rub her cheek into the top of his head, and he was grinning with a peace sign at how his idea was a good one. He started to water the recently planted rose bush with his watering can, and as he began whistling he felt Koneko close by watching them while a slight hint emotion flared for a moment to brief for it to register to him. At first she had gotten rid of her emotions because of how betrayed she felt when she learned that Kuroka sold them, but now she kept her emotions away because this was her way of protecting Naruto from being forced into feeling her emotions.\n\nShe thought that if she didn't visibly show her emotions then Naruto wouldn't be affected by them, which was somewhat true. It was easier for him to feel emotions that people were showing, but it was almost impossible to truly hide them from him. That was why it was almost impossible to get the drop on Naruto, because he could sense everyone's emotions if they were around him. You might be able to hide your energy signature from him, but if you felt even the slightest bit of emotion while in his range then he would know you were there.\n\n\"Ufufufufu, so this is the boy Queen you mentioned eh?\" A feminine voice called out from behind them, and while Naruto wasn't surprised by the sudden arrival, he had felt her coming, Rias almost jumped when she heard that laughing. Naruto hopped out of Rias' lap, before he turned around to see who it was while Rias dusted herself off. Naruto was able to get a good look at the person in this time, and he had to admit that like Rias she was pretty.\n\nThe person that had entered the garden was a young female around Rias' age with long black hair that she had kept up in a ponytail that was wrapped with an orange ribbon much to his joy. By long hair he felt LONG, because you could see that even in a pnytail her hair when down to her knees. She was wearing traditional shrine maiden clothed that showed that she was already well developed in the chest area, and her skin was paler than Rias' it would seem. Her eyes were a seductive shade of purple for some reason, and he could see that she was the kind of person that liked to tease others.\n\n\"This 'boy Queen' is called Naruto, what's your name nya?\" Naruto asked with a friendly gesture of introducing himself first. The girl didn't get to answer because Rias decided that it was her job to introduce memebers of her peerage to each other. She would get Akeno and Koneko to meet each other later when Koneko nwas willing to talk to Akeno, she had a hard time warming up to people after all.\n\n\"This is Akeno Himejima, and she wants to become a member of my peerage. I met her in the human world during my latest trip there. Akeno, this is the Queen of my peerage Naruto which makes him the second in command when I am unable to order commands. I hope the two of you can get along.\" Rias said while grabbing Naruto's hand and pulling him towards Akeno, and then she grabbed Akeno's hand and forced the two of them to shake hands. Naruto smiled while shaking hands, but then he felt a really brief sour feeling coming from Akeno when a small grin spread across her face.\n\n\"Oh, he and I can get along _really_ well.\" Akeno commented with a sensual lick of her lips, and Naruto looked away from her while letting go of her hand. Her teasing had gotten to him, mostly because he was only used to his older sister teasing him. Sadly, Kuroka had been on a secret mission for the last year, and he had not seen her in awhile. He moved behind Rias so that he couldn't see Akeno and get teased more, while she covered her mouth with her hand and giggled again at the first teasing. Rias summoned her remaining Rook piece and held it in front of Akeno.\n\n\"So Akeno, how would you like to become the second Rook of Rias Gremory?\" Rias requested with a small smile on her face, and Akeno nodded lightly with her smile showing what she was truly feeling on the inside. Naruto smiled behind Naruto with the back of his head pressing against her back, and his tail wrappinh around her leg.\n\nThe peerage of Rias Gremory had grown from two to three.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Naruto was worth to much to be turned by a Rook (Five Pawns), or Eight Pawns. Only the Queen (Nine Pawns) would be enough to turn him. That means that Akeno isn't Rias' Queen in this fanfiction.**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: This Fanfiction**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n[Rias Gremory] - King  \nQueen - Naruto Toujou  \nRook - Koneko Tojou / Akeno Himejima  \nBishop - None  \nKnight - None  \nPawn - None\n\n\n\t5. Chapter 5 Pawn Material\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto sighed as he sat in the middle of a group of girls that just wouldn't leave him alone, not that he really minded the attention that much. This was actually a good thing because many of these girls around him called him cute and brought him sweets. So in the end he would act nice and polite to the girls, not that he had a choice with the fact that Rias was making him come to this place five days a week. In the past five years since Naruto had met Akeno a lot had happened to the Gremory Group as they had been nicknamed for some reason.\n\nThe first thing that could be pointed out was the fact that Rias had gotten two more members of her peerage to join up, both of which had no choice in the matter with how they were either dead or on the verge of death when she found them. Now she had a Knight and a person that she used her Mutated Bishop on.\n\nThe first had been Rias' new knight Yuuto Kiba, who she personally named. He was a taller blond male with gray eyes and light skin, mostly because he was born in the west. Rias had found him dying in the snow for some reason that he wouldn't go into. She had really scored when she got him for the reason that he was a human that was born with a very unique power. Yuuto had not just one, but two Sacred Gears in his body. One was the ability to create demon swords thanks to the Sacred Gear Sword Birth, and the other could create holy swords thanks to the Sacred Gear Blade Blacksmith. With his speed boost thanks to him being a Knight his sword abilities would be greatly enhanced. A real treasure for any peerage if you could train him correctly.\n\nThe second addition was a young Dhampire, who was born of a human mother and vampire father, named Gasper Vladi. He was a special breed of vampire that was able to walk in the sunlight, known as a Daywalker. That alone made him a great ally to have in Naruto's opinion, and because he was half human he had been blessed with the gift of having being born with a Sacred Gear inside his body that was known as the Forbidden Balor View, and with it Gasper is able to freeze time on anything he can see. The only exceptions are people with enough power to resist it. Sadly, Gasper had some faults to him as well. He was very cowardly, and pretty much a shut in most of the time. Not to mention that Gasper was a VERY girly boy, going so far as to where girl's clothes instead of boy's clothes. Surprisingly, most of the time it was impossible to tell Gasper wasn't a girl, with only his important part showing that he was a boy.\n\nGasper also had only a small amount of control over his Sacred Gear, but he had been getting much better lately thanks to Naruto's help in working with him. It was rather funny to see Naruto training the taller, but still short, boy in how to control his Sacred Gear by blowing bubbles and making him stop time on them. Gasper had just enough control over his Sacred Gear at this point that he had barely been allowed to roam around freely, because once he had been threatened to be sealed away if he couldn't gain control over his Sacred Gear.\n\n'My head hurts.' Naruto thought as he opened his mouth and sighed. Right now Naruto was located in the one place that was filled with so much emotion that a person his age would go crazy if they had his abilities. Yes, right now Naruto was going to school just like Rias and the rest of her peerage. His emotion sensing powers had only grown more powerful as he grew older, and now he was stuck in a place that had hundreds of emotions running around it at once. Naruto closed his eyes and brought his ability to the back of his mind so that he could try and hold back the river of emotions from everywhere around him.\n\n\"Open up Naruto-kun, I made this chocolate myself!\" One of the girls that he was surrounded by said, and with a his eyes closed he opened his mouth and allowed himself to be fed a small ball of chocolate by the girl. He heard the entire group giggle as he chewed on the sweet ball, and all of the sudden he felt a rush of happiness hit him like a tidal wave. Deep in his gut he felt a rush of happiness, and he himself was forced into feeling happy as well thanks to this. This was part of the negative aspect of his ability, he was directly affected by the emotions he was getting. Powerful emotions affected him more, and he could resist other emotions that came from weaker sources. This wouldn't be a problem most of the time, but that was for people that could turn their ability off.\n\nNaruto could NOT turn his ability off no matter how much he wanted to or tried to. He could feel hundreds of people's emotions at all times, and when he was personally close to somebody he was even more affected by their emotions. If he was in contact with somebody he would also be able to feel it much stronger than before. The only saving grace was that if he was in contact with somebody, their emotions would help block out other girl's emotions. That was he tried to be in contact with at least one person whenever he was at school. Otherwise his head would be swirling with hundreds of emotions that were not his own.\n\n'I wonder whose lap I am sitting on today?' Naruto wondered as a different girl tried to feed him a chocolate ball as well, and in the distance he could feel three extremely jealous people. Naruto opened as eye and tilted his head back so that he could see whose lap he was sitting on during lunch today. Naruto felt his head rest between the girl's breasts, and he blushed very softly at how soft they were when they were touching his head. Anyway, with that the three jealous spikes grew by ten times, but he tried to ignore it as he looked at the girl's face.\n\nThe girl that he was sitting on today was a member of the Kendo Club it would seem, and if he remember right then her name was Murayama. She was a girl with brown hair that she kept in two pontytails at the back of her head, and brown bangs framing her face without covering her warm yellowish brown eyes. Her body was well developed for a human girl, being on the more attractive end of the scale. She wasn't even phased by the fact his head was nuzzled between her breasts, all she seemed to care about was that she wanted to have her arms around his stomach at all times. As a member of the Kendo Club her body was very well fit, which made her even more beautiful instead of those diet girls that barely ate.\n\n\"I heard you like fish, so how about some of my home cooked catfish.\" The second girl of the group said as she used a small fork to move some fired fish towards his lips. This second girl in the group of three girls, today, said as she fed him a fork of fried fish. Naruto looked over her again as he started to chew on the fish, and after the sweetness of the chocolate he had to admit the fish tsted great. This second girl was the other member of the Kendo Club that had the best body, and she was Katase. A girl with very light brown hair that seemed to be tinted red, and she was the one that had paler skin and reddish brown eyes. She was smaller than her friend all around, including the chest area. Her most notable trait was her short hair that she had held out of her face to show off her forehead. Naruto swallowed the fish, and decided that if they were going to feed him then he may as well show his appreciation by showing them the 'cute' side they liked seeing.\n\n\"It tasted yummy, I love how you fried it Katase-san nya!\" Naruto said with a wide smile, and the girl's face couldn't stay straight before she lunged and hugged his neck while his face landed into her bussom while the back of his head was still in Murayama's chest.\n\n\"Oh! You are just so cute Naruto-kun, you can call me Katase-chan or even Onee-chan if you want!\" Katase nearly squeeled as she gushed over Naruto, and that spike of jealousy from earlier doubled in size. Naruto could hear muffled yells from a few guys, but with his ears surrounded by boob he was unable to completely make it out before it stopped and Katase stopped hugging his face when she was pulled off by the last girl.\n\nThis girl was somebody that Naruto knew by first and last name, and she was known as Tomoe Meguri. Like the others, she was a second year at this school. The major differences though was that this girl was a member of the student council... and a Devil. Yes, this girl was a devil from thje peerage of a different woman that went to this school. Tomoe was a girl with shoulder-length reddish brown hair and brown eyes. She had wind swept bangs, and hair antenna sticking from the top of her head. She was the Knight in the peerage of Sona Sitri, the Heir to the Sitri family.\n\nThat placed her as an important devil, and strangely enough this hyperactive girl had a fetish for younger guys. She was technically the lowest rank of Devil, besides the Low-Class Pawn. She was a Low-Class Knight, and yet she insisted on going after Naruto as a romantic interest. She liked to use lunch as a chance to get at Naruto while he couldn't escape her. She was a very nice girl, but she treated him like he was a normal person. That was both likable and annoying of her, because in both rank and status Naruto outranked her. You see, in the last five years Naruto had been promoted from a Low-Class Devil to a Middle-Class Devil, which was one rank away from being a High-Class Devil. Add that to the fact that he was the Queen of Rias' peerage and you had a Middle-Class Queen. Of course, besides the fact that he wanted to become an Ultimate-Class one day he didn't really think much of rank.\n\n\"Hey now, Naruto-kun hasn't tried the cookies I made in Home Economics today. Come on Naruto-kun, they are peanut-butter cookies!\" Tomoe said, and despite the fact that she was a Devil she was still one of the girl's that liked to feed him things during lunch. Naruto munched on the cookie while she started to pet his head, and he nodded to her in satisfaction at how enjoyment of the cookie. Naruto noticed the jealousy from earlier replace itself with depression and sadness, so opening his eyes he looked over to the direction and saw that there were three boys that were also well known in the school.\n\nThe Perverted Trio were crying tears of pain as they watched a younger boy get feed and pamper by three beautiful woman. These were the kinds of guys that were completely open with how perverted they were, which inculded peeping on woman that were changing.\n\n\"Hey Katase-chan, Murayama-chan, and Tomoe-chan... why don't invite them over to eat lunch with us? They look like they were pretty lonely nya.\" Naruto offered in a way to make the people that were bringing down his good mood happy. Frankly, Naruto always tried to make people happy so that he would have to feel their bad emotions. The girl's faced darkened right away when they looked to see who Naruto was talking about, while the boys were looking at Naruto like he was ther savour or something.\n\n\"You would be better not to let their filthy pervserse thoughts infect you with whatever diseases they have Naruto-kun. Those are the perverted trio of idiots. They peep on girls and read porn in class.\" Katase stated as she and her Kendo friend sent death glares at the three boys, who now had their heads down on the ground again. Naruto closed his eyes, before he opened them again and let used his own silver hair and yellow eye combination to make himself seem even more like a pouting kitten.\n\n\"B-but if you pr-protect me then I won't get inf-infected.\" Naruto pleaded lightly, seeing as perverts didn't really bother him that much... he was going to have to punish himself for using his cuteness to get his way, but that could come later. The girls, even Tomoe, completely fell under his charm and blushed deeply as his charm caught them all deeply in his trap.\n\n\"Hey you perverts, you can eat lunch over here... but try anything and you won't live to see tomorrow!\" Murayama shouted at the trio, and like lightning they started to run over to the group sitting on the grass and started bowing down to Naruto. They uttered thanks to Naruto, before they looked up and started to show him that they were now crying tears of joy. Naruto was able to see that each of them were pretty average in the looks deperartment, besides the middle one that was slightly above his two friends in look.\n\nMatsuda, the 'Perverted Baldy' and 'Sexual Harassment Papparazzi' of the group was a bald boy with tan skin that kept his eyes closed most of the time. He was once apart of the sports team, and had been a star player before the calling of the pervert got to him. He was hte lolicon of the group.\n\nMotohama, the 'Perverted Glasses' and 'Three Sizes Scouter' was a boy that wore glasses and had shaggy brown hair. He was rumored to be able to tell a girl's three sizes just by looking at them, whish was an impressive skill. Naruto himself could tell a girl's three sizes if they placed them on his head.\n\nFor example, Murayama's three sizes were B84-W70-H81 all in centimeters, and Katase's three sizes were B78.5-W65-H79 also in centimeters. He never told anyone about this talent besides Koneko, Akeno, and Rias because over the years they had been using his head to find out what their new bra sizes were over the years, and seriously, both Rias and Akeno had gained bombastic bodies in the past five years.\n\nThe finaly member, and presumed leader, of the Perverted Trio was Issei Hyoudou. A slightly above average looking boy with hazel eyes and brown hair that stuck out in the back. His was slightly tan, but he had nothing to show that his body was fit other than the fact that he wasn't fat, showing that he ddin't really excersize often. He was considered the most perverted of the trio for some reason, even though he was always the most respectful of the girls. Yes, he peeked, but at least he never admitted to 'raping' the girls in his head like the other two. He was just unlucky in the fact that he was caught peeping more, but he never groped girls like the other two. All in all, despite his bad rep he was the most bearable of the three perverts.\n\n'Something is... off about him though.' Naruto said as his eyes narrowed at Issei, and for a breif moment he was sure that he could feel something in him that also was a source of emotion... no wait, there WAS something inside him that had it's own set of emotions. He was sure that somwhere deep inside Issei there was a Sacred Gear, because this boy smelled completely human. If he was possessed, or wasn't a human then Naruto would be able to smell it. That meant that the something inside him was a Sacred Gear.\n\nIssei Hyoudou was a human with a Sacred Gear that had no affiliation with any of the other factions, this means that he was free to become a member of Rias' peerage with some convincing. Naruto blinked when he felt a spike of understanding come from Tomoe, as well as a sense of urgency as well. Meaning that she had seen the look on his face, and figured out that Issei had a Sacred Gear as well.\n\n'Not good, Sona will jump at the chance to have another Sacred Gear user.' Naruto thought as he realized that Tomoe was going to tell Sona about Issei as well. Not only would Sona be able to get in contact with Issei quicker, but Sona was also better about talking people into joining her peerage than Rias. Rias depended on others to make her peerage larger, with only Akeno being talked into becoming a member. Naruto and Koneko were gifts to her, Yuuto was dying, and Gasper had died as well. Frankly, she had gotten lucky with how easy she had it getting her peerage. Sona had scouted for her own peerage, and then she would approach them and offer them what they wanted so that they would join her.\n\nIf Sona got to Issei before Rias, then his King could kiss a new member goodbye.\n\nNaruto could ruin his reputation though and run to tell her the urgent news right now, because as Rias' Queen she had tasked him with scouting for peerage material. For one, if he abandoned these girls without a good reason and ran away to do something that would raise questions. Questions were not something Naruto was good at answering, and if position as the scout would be in trouble if Sona found out about him. That would make his job hard, because right now he was the only one with the ability to scout out people as well thanks to his abilities.\n\nIn his distraction he never noticed what the perverted trio were saying, but he did notice when Katase started to beat the hell out of them with a furious blush on her face while they tried to escape from her wrath. He didn't pay very much attention to that either, thinking on how to get Issei on their side was more important.\n\nRight now Rias needed to get some serious power on her side if she wanted to defeat _him_ in a Rating Game. That was part of the reason that Naruto had gotten so close to Murayama and Katase, because they had formal sword training and physically fit bodies with a good amount of stamina. He was hoping that he could get them to join up with Rias soon, because Murayama would make a great Knight, while Katase was good Pawn material. Even if they weren't Sacred Gear users, they would be very helpful in the future with what skills they already had. Heck, maybe having them both as Pawns would be a good idea so that they could promote to Rook, Knight, or Queen and gain a good boost to their already healthy bodies.\n\nNot to mention that they were fans of Rias and Akeno already, so they would be relativally easy to get over to their side. Of course, they were a back up plan for if they didn't have enough members in time. They already had training in a form of combat, so with the increae in abilities turning into a devil would grant they would be good members even at the start of their training.\n\nAnyway, he had to tell Rias about Issei as soon as he could.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**This story will be updated next.  \nNext Questions Omake will be Chapter 10.**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\nFan letter to Rias the 'Lovable Red head'  \n\"I was under the idea that High-class devils would have the evil pieces and can start their own peerage. So how is it that you already had evil pieces when you were not even a teenager yet?\"\n\n\"I was BORN as a High-class Devil, so as soon as my father says I am ready for them then I get them. As a member of the Gremnory family I was born into High-class status.\" Rias answered the questioned without dely.\n\nFan letter to Naruto the 'Soon to be famous Male Queen'  \n\"What your opinion of everyone else in Rias' peerage so far?\"\n\n\"Male Queen... I like it. Anyway, I like all the other peerage members at the moment.\" Naruto answered while scratching his head in confusion.\n\n\n\t6. Chapter 6 Pawns\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Issei Hyoudou huh... isn't he that infamous pervert?\" Rias questioned Naruto while he sat right next to his sister on the couch opposite to Rias. In the room was a pale blond haired boy a few inches taller than Naruto with pink eyes wearing a girl's school uniform, but he was sitting inside of a box. Sitting on Rias' left side was Yuuto drinking a cup of tea provided by the resident cook and Rook Akeno. Gasper was playing on some kind of video game to keep himself from freaking out at the thought of new people. Naruto knew he was a nervous guy, but his reason for not going to class was kind of bad to him. Naruto went through physical pain sometimes by going to class.\n\n\"The one that is the Leader of the Perverted Trio right?\" Akeno questioned as well before Naruto could answer Rias' question about Issei. Koneko was sulking lightly at not having gotten the chance to eat with Naruto today, they already had their classes seperated so lunch and when school was out was the only time they got together. Naruto placed an arm around her to comfort her, and the affect was that she started to calm down right away without Naruto even having to look at her to do it.\n\n\"I sensed a Sacred Gear inside him during lunch today, and I fear that Tomoe was able to notice my reaction. If we don't hurry then Issei will be drafted into devilhood by Sona, and you know that if she gets to him then you won't have a chance.\" Naruto pointed out the sense of urgency that they should be feeling at the moment. Rias nodded very lightly with a smile on her face, not seeming to have any worries over this matter. She had already had her eye on Issei thanks to the recent Fallen Angels keeping an eye on him. She just didn't have a name to put to a fact at the moment, and now that she did she could plan around this. Closing her eyes and setting her tea cup down, she leaned back and laced her fingers together. This would be a problem though if Issei was taken, but he was just one Sacred Gear user out of the few that have been comfirmed in this school.\n\nNaruto had already given her the names of those two that he had believed would make good Pawns for her peerage, so even if they lost Issei they would still get two very good Pawns that had training before becoming devils. If Sona got Issei, then not only would she had to work on motivating him, but she would also need to work on his base stats, hand to hand, and all the other aspects of being a devil. In the end, she had a few aces in the hole for if Sona did get to Issei. Thankfully though, she already had a plan for getting to Issei. His nature as a pervert would be easy for her to play on, and it wasn't like she was a modest person with showing off her body. Yes, getting a pervert into her peerage would be as easy as tricking a child.\n\n\"Yuuto and Koneko, would you two please go get Issei before he leaves the school grounds?\" Rias asked with a sweet tone to her voice, and the blue eyes boy nodded with a small smile on his face. Koneko huffed lightly, before she stood up with a nod like Yuuto. If Fallen Angels were after Issei, then it would be best that they don't go alone if they were going after him.\n\n\"I will do that right away Buchou.\" Yuuto said as he and Koneko left the room through the main door, and Naruto laid back on the couch with a relaxed sigh. Yuuto was somebody that gave him conflicted feeling, because he was able to feel what Yuuto was truly feeling deep down in his soul. That festering hate bubbling under the surface waiting to explode was something that Naruto would rather avoid if given the chance. Naruto's eye went to Gasper playing somehting called Mario, before he felt that Gasper was feeling veryu nervou about the thought of meeting new people. The boy was lucky that Naruto was helping him control his Sacred Gear, or he might have bigger problems than meeting new people.\n\n\"So Naruto-kun... what is your personal opinion on what will raise my chances of beating Riser in a Rating Game? Will Issei be able to make a big difference, or will these two Kendo Club members with no Sacred Gears be able to better increase my chances?\" Rias asked her most powerful piece his opinion on the matter, while Naruto placed his hand on his chin in thought. Riser was the potential fiance that Rias would have to marry if she couldn't defeat Riser in a Rating Game, but the difference between them was that Riser had experience and a full peerage. That means that his pieces would be much more experienced, and in larger number than what they had.\n\n\"Hmm, well with Gasper we will be able to quickly take out the lesser pieces like Pawns quickly with or without either of them. The only problem would be taking them all out before they get into our terrirtory nya. Then they can promote and gain power, but if that happens Akeno and I can still take them out. Riser's most powerful pieces are his Rooks, Knights, and his Queen as well as his sister being his Bishop nya. Yuuto can take care of the Rooks by using his speed advantage, but then he will be open for the Knights. Koneko and Akeno are not fast enough for fighting against a Knight, and I will need to be near you in case Riser goes after you directly... We don't know what Issei's Sacred Gear is, so depending on that aspect of him would be foolish. Two well trained Pawns with bodies that can withstand a promotion would be best in this case, but there is the chance Issei will have a great Sacred Gear for battle nya.\" Naruto started out his explaination on how the battle would go at this point. Gasper would be a key player in this battle, but his Sacred Gear is both a blessing and a curse. He didn't have a high enough control of it to not affect his allies that were to weak to resist it, and for some reason Naruto was the only one in Rias' peerage that could resist the affects for some unknown reason. The major threats were Riser Phenex, Ravel Phenex, his Queen, and his Knights. The rest of his pieces were more like Canon Fodder than a real threat at this point.\n\n\"If I turn into bats... I can increase the number of people I can freeze.\" Gasper pointed out with a slightly unsure tone, and Naruto sighed lightly.\n\n\"Yes, but it would be better to keep you near out area so that we can stop them from promoting their pieces. If you go into their territory you are wide open for attack, and you can't promote like a Pawn. You are a key player in defending Rias, which makes your safety a high priority nya. Koneko, Yuuto, and Akeno will be key players in invading the enemy territory at this moment nya.\" Naruto explained gently so that he didn't make Gasper feel weak or unimportant. Gasper was barely able to keep his Sacred Gear from automatically activating, and that was thanks to Naruto. His Gear was just as much a blessing as it was a curse, so he needed to be in a place by himself so that he won't affect his allies.\n\n\"That doesn't answer my question though, in your opinion what option is better for victory?\" Rias asked naruto with a bit more urgency in her voice, while he nodded in remeberence to her question.\n\n\"I am getting to that. You or I will have to personally take care of his Queen, and Gasper will search out his sister when we have gotten rid of his other pieces nya. Then while he keeps her frozen we can gang up on Riser with everyone we have left... I say the better option is Murayama and Katase in this case. They have both training in how to be swordswomen, their bodies are well conditioned, and they are very motivated in getting better. With them we get a high number of people that can promote, and they will be easier to train... with Issei we would have to work on him attaining his Sacred Gear, hoping it is a battle ready Sacred Gear, teaching him how to use it, prepare his body to handle the stain of promoting, increase his base stats, find a way to motivate him, get him battle experience and increase his reflexes, and that is just very time consuming when we don't know when Riser will make the challenge nya.\" Naruto explained with a frustrated look on his face. Issei would potentially be MUCH more valuable than both girls combined, but could they really take a chance on if he could be better? They didn't even know what his Sacred Gear was at this point, or how many Pawns he would take. If he took to many they would lose out on numbers later, and Sacred gear users were always known to take more than one Pawn. The girls had training, and they would be battle ready within days of getting used to real swords, and increasing their base stats would be very simple when it came to motivation.\n\n\"There are too many variables in this... so either the two that are the obvious choice, or the wild card that could be worth a lot down the road. This is a very hard choice indeed, and I will trust your opinion on this. Akeno, could you bring the two girls here for me, the Kendo Club doesn't let out until 5:30 anyway so they should still be there.\" Rias requested of her more powerful Rook, who strangely fought with mostly spells. Akeno smiled lightly and bowed to Rias in understanding, before she set out on her own way to go get the girls that would help Rias in her future as a King. When she was gone only three people were left in the room, and one of them wasn't much of a talker.\n\n\"Hopefully Issei is only worth a few Pawns, and we can get all three of them. I highly doubt that though because his Sacred Gear had emotions, which means that it has a personality. It would worth a lot to turn him... sadly just being worth a lot doesn't mean that it is usefull. Much like that Sacred Gear that lets you see through clothes because the spirit of some peeper named Tom...\" Naruto said before he paused when he realized that the original Peeping Tom had been turned into a Sacred Gear that allowed people to look through people's clothes. Rather useless in battle, and for all they knew Issei's was useless as well.\n\n\"Okay, now that we have a game plan on who to pick lets get back to planning. I think that we should send Koneko and Yuuto into enemy territory first, both of them are good at sneaking around. Maybe they can eliminate a few before the direct battle starts, and then work on setting up traps.\" Rias suggested first in the usual conversation she and Naruto had when they were pretty much alone, well the conversation they usually had when they needed to come up with plans that they could use against Riser Phenex. Right now the odds were lightly more in his favor than theirs, which they needed to correct as quickly as possible.\n\n\"No... Yuuto should run around the border of out area while Koneko and Akeno set off into enemy territory. If Riser is smart he would be thinking of overwhelming you with power by distracting us with his high ranks pieces long enough for his Pawns to get in deep and promote, and then we will be overwhelmes by high ranking pieces with experience... we also have to consider the fact that they are allow two items per Rating Game. That means that they may have Phoenix Tears to heal themselves... Yuuto will patrol the area and take care of any Pawns trying to get in, and either I or Gasper will take care of the ones that get through.\" Naruto said as he placed the pieces on the chess board Rias had around to represent all the different areas and places that people should be. Right now it showed both Rooks in the enemy territoy, the Knight at the egde of the territorys, the Bishop near the Knight, and the King and Queen next to each other.\n\n\"... I can see your point, and while Akeno and Koneko act as distraction we can promote either Issei or Murayama and Katase into higher pieces, before we start moving forward and begin picking them off. Gasper, you will be in charge of keeping Ravel frozen in time for as long as you can... maybe his Queen as well. Better safe than sorry, think you can handle it?\" Rias asked her Bishop, and her answer was Gasper giving her a shaky nod and a shy thumbs up. Naruto looked over the pieces for a second, before he picked up the Bishop and Knight that weren't being used.\n\n\"You still need to fill these positions... we can win without them, but it would be better if you got something to fill them with nya.\" Naruto said seriously, and even his 'nya' sounded serious as well. Rias closed her eyes and nodded, before she let out a sigh. She knew that she could easily win if she had all her pieces filled, and with her Queen she could just send out Naruto and he could take care of all of Riser's peerage besides his Queen... that would leave HER open to attack, and if she was taken out that was Game Over for the entire thing. She had to rely on her entire peerage for a winning plan.\n\nRiser and Ravel were the most dangerous in the game though, both of them would be extremely hard to defeat by damage. They were from the Phenex family, and had instant regeneration because of that. They weren't impossible to hurt, but actually putting them down would be too hard. That was why Gasper would freeze Ravel and the rest of them would gang up on Riser and throw whatever they had at him long enough for either herself or Naruto to land a fatal blow on him. Her Power of Destruction or Naruto's Youjutsu would be the key to finishing Riser, but if Naruto was defeated her chances of winning would go down from 40 percent to 10 percent.\n\nAs much as she hated to admit it, Riser was powerful in his own right. He could easily take out Kiba, Gasper, and Koneko if given the chance. Akeno would be defeated as well if things were turned into a dragged out fight, while she knew that she herself had a good chance of losing without Naruto's help to weaken his healing long enough to give a fatal blow.\n\n\"Naruto-kun, how is your Youjutsu coming? Can you promise that you can defeat Riser if given the chance?\" Rias asked seriously, while Naruto thought about it for a second.\n\n\"I can do it, but I would need some time. Riser has a high mastery over Fire, Wind, and with his instant healing he will be trouble to put down nya. I have been working on something that I think will take care of the Fire and Healing though... I am pretty sure I can do it if I get get him one on one though nya.\" Naruto said with a sure tone to his voice. He knew that if he could get Riser alone then he would be able to use his Youjutsu to slow his healing and negate his fire abilities completely. Then it was just a matter of hitting him with an attack powerful enough to put him down, but he had nothing to take care of the wind attacks.\n\n\"Good, and while you do that I will take down the Queen with some help if I need it. Yuuto has been working on a sword that can 'delete' fire so he may be usefull against Riser as well. Yuuto should go against Riser before you and see if he can defeat him with his Sword Birth.\" Rias commented to Naruto, while he nodded slightly. Even if Yuuto was defeated it wasn't like he was going to die, and while they didn't like this idea of using him there was a lot on the line here. Yuuto would understand why, and they would fully explain it to him so that he didn't think they were sending him to his defeat. He had a real chance of defeating Riser if he made a sword that could take care of fire.\n\nNaruto blinked before he realized that Yuuto and Koneko were coming back with a slight depressed feeling, which meant that they failed and Issei had already been gotten by Sona. That or Issei was dead by a Fallen Angel's hands, and the body was completely destroyed.\n\n\"Yuuto and Koneko are coming back without Issei... and Akeno is coming back with the two I told you about. It would seem that Sona or the Fallen Angels got to him first.\" Naruto concluded when he felt Akeno enter his range with two more people with her that were feeling excited. Akeno herself was feeling excited as well, but no doubt for a different reason.\n\n\"Damnit Sona.\" Rias muttered with a nasty pout on her face, before she cheered up at the news that she would still be getting two Pawns out of this. Normal humans like these ones would only cost one piece each, meaning that she would still have six pawns left after them. That was equal to a Rook and a Pawn, two Knights or Bishops, a Knight or Bishop and three Pawns, or just simply six Pawns. That was still a max of eight pieces she could still use counting the Knight and Bishop. She could still have a full peerage of 15 people if she found the right people to fill the roles.\n\nRias startled slightly when she felt Naruto sit on her lap and lean back into her breasts with his cat ears sticking out of his head, and when she looked down at him she saw him wink at her. She smiled back and leaned back so that the two of them were relaxing again, with more people coming Naruto would have to deal with more emotions again, so by getting into contact with her he was focusing on her emotions. That, or he was just getting her to relax by doing what they did to bond when they were younger, and he was still able to sit her her lap. She wrapped an arm around his stomach while using her other hand to run him behind the ears.\n\nNow this would be a strange scene for anyone, as well as an ironic one.\n\nNaruto was a male Queen, and he was sitting in the lap his his female King Rias. They were a very unique pair, he was the youngest person in her peerage, while also being her strongest. She was his first non-family friend, but was also his legal owner. Yet, despite all that they were still the best of friends, as close as best friend can be.\n\n\"I miss our garden, you ever wonder how our roses are doing?\" Rias asked with a slight smile on her face when she thought about the rose bush they planted together. Their little garden had flourished in the years they had worked on it together, and even Koneko had watered it a few times with them. It was tradition though for Naruto and Rias to water it with him in her lap while they just talked about whatever came to their minds, while deepening their bonds.\n\n\"Yeah, but Grayfia is taking care of it while we are gone. They are going to be doing great nyaaaa.\" Naruto said while he experienced pure bliss when Rias found that one spot behind his ear, and he completely melted into her body when she started to lightly scratch him right behind the right ear with the very tips of her fingernails. Even the emotions of everyone around him besides Rias' were wiped from his mind when he skilled hands touched him. His tail came out and started to wrap around her waist as he sank into her soft body and completley relaxed.\n\n'I don't want to interupt this.' Gasper thought with a small smile as he closed himself inside the lid of his box, and with it shut it was like he wasn't in the room at all. He felt awkward around them when they were like this.\n\nThis was a private moment between great friends.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to be Updated: This Again**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n_[Rias Gremory Peerage]_  \nKing - Rias Gremory  \nQueen - Naruto Toujou  \nRooks - Koneko Toujou, Akeno Himejima  \nBishop - Gasper Vladi  \nKnight - Yuuto Kiba  \nPawns - None\n\n\n\t7. Chapter 7 Future Negativity\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'I think I am going to throw up!' Naruto thought with wide eyes as he ran towards the trashcan in the clubroom and knelt in front of it with his face as pale as it could get. Naruto surprised the rest of the devils in the room by actually getting physically sick and throwing up into the trashcan. Koneko wasted no time in rushing over to his side and patting him softly on the back to help him out.\n\nIt had been two days since they had lost out on the chance to gain Issei as a peerage member, but they were also glad to know that Issei was worth too much for Sona to reincarnate as well. That meant that Issei was still completely human that the moment, which meant that it was possible top get him as an ally later if they played their cards right. The only difference though was that now neither Rias nor Sona would be able to get Issei into their peerages, because Rias had already talked both of the girl's chosen by Naruto into her peerage as her Pawns, which meant that she didn't have enough pieces to reincarnate Issei either.\n\nRight now both girls were currently running around the city handing out contract papers so that they would be able to form contracts with humans and raise their abilities and status among the devils. Both girls had been immediently interested in the idea when they heard that Naruto, Rias, Akeno, Koneko, and Yuuto were devils... or hybrids. Each of them had a special place in the school, and each were famous in their own right. Naruto and Koneko were the Twin Mascots of the school, Yuuto was the 'Prince' of the school, and both Rias and Akeno were the Two Great Ladies of the school. Each of them were amazingly popular among the students, male and female alike in some cases. In others only the females liked Yuuto, while the men hated his guts. The fact that turning into a devil would make them stronger was something both girls looked forward too.\n\n\"Otouto, are you okay?\" Koneko asked with a worried tone to her voice when she saw her brother randomly start to throw up into a trashcan. The others were worried as well for his safety, because Naruto normally had a stomach of steel when it came to most stuff. Something could be seriously wrong with him if he was throwing up for any reason.\n\n\"Such... insanity... evil... killing urge... I have never felt such a VILE thing before.\" Naruto managed to get out in reference to him sensing such a powerful negative emotion that he had gotten visibly sick just from the backlash of sensing this. His own body was completely rejecting the emotions that he was sensing, and the inner conflict that these emotions that were not his was causing was gut rending for him. His words didn't make the others feel any better, nor did it make their worries go away when Naruto was forced to throw up again when he felt another wave of the emotion come into his mind. He vomitted into the trash, while Koneko wrapped her arms around his stomach to held sooth him.\n\nIt was so random what he was feeling, and it would vanish before reappearing again even stronger, before rgowing weak to the point that he couldn't feel it. Then it would jump back to insane levels, completely throwing him off guard when he was forced into sensing it again. even when he had nothing left in his stomach to throw up, the feeling that he needed to throw up was still there inside his gut.\n\n\"Was it a Fallen Angel?\" Akeno asked with a frown, because as far as she knew this had only happened to Naruto two times before in his life. Both times Naruto had met people that had been completely rotten to the core, and one had been so bad that at his age Naruto had been bed ridden for two weeks just from his body tearing itself up while adjusting to the extreme negative and evil emotions that had been flowing off that person.\n\n\"No... this was a human, the Fallen Angels around here are crazy... but not this demented. This person... feels a lot like Diodora Astaroth... a human version of that bastard!\" Naruto growled out in utter anger at the one person that he hated above all other. The others around him had no idea why Naruto hated Diodora so much, mostly because they were not as in the know about the bastards crimes as Naruto was. Spying on this bastard was one of Kuroka's first spy jobs, and she had told him personally what she found out about the guy. She had confided in him because even she was disgusted by what this devil did to others.\n\nDiodora Astaroth was the Heir of the Astaroth family, and the younger brother of one of the current Satans. This boy was so twisted and sick that he was secretely commiting evil crimes that no sane devil these days would even think of committing. The worst part was that there was no real proof to pin his crimes on him without Kuroka admitting to spying on him, and as the Heir to the Astaroth family they couldn't just kill him in cold blood... even though every fiber of Naruto's very soul demanded that Diodora be killed for what he does... and takes pleasure in.\n\nDiodora Astaroth was a sick man, a very evil person. Diodora Astaroth RAPED nuns and maidens both physically and mentally. His crimes would start with him tricking a nun into committing a crime against the Church and having her kicked out of the Church, and while they were sulking and heart broken he would prey upon them with his sick and twisted words thayt he could twist into sounding sweet and caring. He would get the nuns to trust him, and look up to him... and then he would rape them. Worst of all was that he took enjoyment in their betrayed horror, and he would do it over and over again until they were completely broken. His entire peerage was filled with nuns and maidens that he had broken and added to his 'collection' where they would be forever his broken slaves.\n\nNaruto made it his personal mission to find proof of Diodora's actions, and with that proof he would be able top put that punk on the chopping block for death row. Naruto wanted Diodora dead as soon as possible, but the only way that he could prove it would be for him to find a nun that he had gotten kicked out of the Church, but hand't raped yet. Then he would be able to prove that he had been threatening the stale mate with the Angels by going after holy women.\n\n\"There is a human vile enough to cause this sort of reaction? Are you sure?\" Yuuto asked to confirm what Naruto was saying, and a blank stare was his responce. This person would be the third person that Naruto had reacted this badly to, so of course Naruto was sure what this guy was.\n\n\"This person sounds scary!\" Gasper yelled as he closed himself completely inside his box, while Naruto wiped his mouth off and drank some of the tea that Akeno handed him. He gulped it down like he was a man in the desert drowing of thirst, before he finished it and gave her a thankful look. He could still fell the backlash from this person, but right now Naruto was focusing and lowering his range to as short as it could go. Naruto stood up and wobbled on his feet lightly, before he leaned against the wall with a thin layer of sweat on his face.\n\nHis always active power had another weakness besides overloading him, and that was when Naruto was faced with an emotion that was the opposite of him and extremely strong it made him truly sick. His body completely rejected everything about these emotions, and the internal battle would slowly tear him apart until he could force himself to block out the one person causing them. There were people that disgusted him like Riser, but mostly because they were assholes, and then their were people that caused him to become sick like Diodora, an unknown person, and this guy that gave off a slight Devil Hunter aura around him that Naruto could sense even from here.\n\n\"I need to take a walk and clear my head.\" Naruto said shortly, meaning for there to be no arguments as he walked out of the clubroom with heavy steps. Right now he needed to go find the other important person that he had sensed before he was forced to pull back his range as much as possible. An emotion to bright and positive that he was being attracted to it like a moth to a flame, but instead o being stopped Naruto felt a wave of kind emotion touch him when his hand was grabbed by Rias.\n\n\"Be careful, if this person made you sick then they may be strong. I would send somebody with you, but Yuuto and Koneko are going to be busy training Katase and Murayama in how to control their new bodies.\" Rias said, and he completely understood where she was coming from. Koneko came forward and kissed Naruto on the cheek slightly to wish him good luck on his trip, while Akeno smiled at him and pat him on the back. Naruto knew that Gasper was to sh to come with him on a walk through the city.\n\n\"See you later guys, Good-for-Nothing Vampire nya.\" Naruto said with his and Koneko's special goodbye made just for Gasper, the nickname that wasn't nearly as mean as it sounded. He heard Gasper shout of a goodbye from inside his box, before Naruto stopped and walked over to the box. Ripping open the lid to the box, he pulled a blushing and protesting Gasper out of the box and hefted him over his shoulder. The fact Gasper was taller than Naruto made this image as funny as hell, a short Short-Neko-Boy-Queen was carrying a Girly-Crossdressing- Dhampire-Boy over his shoulder, while the pink eyes boy tried to get out of Naruto's grip.\n\n\"Please let go of m-me Naruto... I don't want to go outside!\" Gasper pleaded, but he was promptly oignored by Naruto in favor of him turning to Rias with a small smile on his face.\n\n\"I am taking Gasper with me, see you all later.\" Naruto said with a sigh as he started to feel better already now that he was in contact with somebody that he trusted and knew well. As long as he stayed in contact with Gasper he would be able to resist the negative emotions all over the city. That and the fact that if Naruto was going to have to go outside of his comfort zone, then he was going to make this awkward for Gasper as well.\n\n\"Please let me go Naruto, I don't like sunlight.\" Gasper tried to get Naruto to let go of him again, only for Naruto to raise his hand and smack Gasper on the ass hard enough to make the blond haired Dhampire 'eep' and stop all resisting at the humiliation of getting a spank. Naruto nodded neutrally, before he started to walk out of the clubroom again.\n\nWhat? As the Queen of Rias' peerage it was his job to both help and punish the members of Rias' peerage when he though it would help them out. If Gasper always stayed in his comfort zone he would never grow as a person. Gasper looked and acted so much like a girl that Naruto felt no awkwardness about spanking the silent Dhampire, honestly, it wasn't that strange for either Rias or Naruto to deliver a Devil Spank as a motivation/punishment. The major difference was that Naruto got you ONCE most of the time, while when Rias spanked you she did it somewhere between 100 and 1000 times while using magic.\n\n\"If I have to go to school, you have to go outside. Now lets go into the city and take a walk!\" Naruto shouted at Gasper as the door was slammed behind them, and the others left in the room sweat dropped when they saw the group leave.\n\n'Naruto-kun... you are perhaps the only one that treats Gasper like that.' Rias though with a sweat drop when she heard the sounds of arguments outside of the door. There was a smack sound again, and then complete silence, meaning that Gasper had tried to use his Sacred Gear to excape, only for Naruto to smack his ass before he could and continue walking anyway. Sometimes it was best to leave Gasper's growth to Naruto, the only person in her peerage that could resist the time stopping powers of Gasper's Sacred Gear.\n\n\"Ufufufu, it would seem that Gasper-kun will be getting some courage training today.\" Akeno said with a teasing giggle, and a sensual lick of her lips at the obvious teasing. She just loved it when other people were uncomfy, and right now both Naruto and Gasper were way out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"Naruto won't let Gasper get hurt, so there shouldn't be any problem. Anyway, this will be good for them both. Right now Naruto only goes to the school, but never in the city. Gasper is only used to people in the club seeing him, so it would be good for him tp experience life on the outside. Naruto knows this, and Gasper will help Naruto keep from sensing as many emotions if they remain in contact. This will be a good thing for both of them.\" Rias concluded as a red circle appeared in the middle of the clubroom, showing that somebody was using the Gremory circle to teleport to their location. That could only mean that Katase and Murayama had completed handing out flyers, and were ready to come back to the clubroom.\n\n'Otouto, you better know what you are doing.' Koneko thought with her neutral face turned into a frowning one. She knew Naruto well enough to know that if he was taking Gasper then he was going to search for somebody, and Gasper's ability was great when it came to capturing people without them noticing until it was too late. That, or Naruto was going to abuse Gasper's abilities to go on a pranking spree. That was the way he worked, he liked to do everything in his power to either get further in life, or have fun. This could be pleasure or business, either of which had some flaws to it.\n\nShe knew though that she was needed in order to train the new devils as soon as possible, because Naruto was more of a one on one trainer. When training a group he didn't really have any talent in that, but he could teach anyone one on one in the arts of fighting. Between that and his growing abilities in emotion sensing he was going to have a hard time in group training, and his temporary method of blocking out emotions only lasted so long before it ran out.\n\nNo... it was like his body was getting prepared for something, and his emotion sensing abilities were his bodies way of getting prepared. The question though was what did his emotion sensing powers have to do with his body getting ready for something. As much as she was not going to like this, she knew that there was only one person she could trust to have a serious answer to this question.\n\nKuroka.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Seriously, go to the Highschool DxD Wiki page and see Gasper's image, the dude is the perfect crossdresser. I have a plan for him as well, that will remain secret at this point.

Chapter 8 The Arrival of Trouble\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto sighed in relief as he and Gasper walked through the city hand in hand, nobody was giving them a strange glance thanks to the fact that Gasper looked so much like a girl... while wearing girl's clothes to go with his natural girly looks. If Naruto wasn't completely sure that Gasper was a boy, he too would be one of the people that would naturally think that Gasper was a female. As it was, Naruto wasn't disgusted in the least by holding his friend's hand. This wasn't exactly an option for him, until he could turn on and off his empathy powers he HAD to hold onto somebody and remain in physical contact to keep from overloading his head with hundreds or even thousands of emotions that were not his own.\n\nAs it was, Gasper's nervousness was the main emotion in his head while the emotions of the people around them were dulled down to a range of 10 meters before he couldn't feel anyone anymore. His range may have decreased because of his contact with Gasper, but he was still being affected by Gasper's emotions as well, but he was used to dealing with the Dhampire's nervousness. He was able to easily shrug off the nervous feeling that he automatically began to feel by being in contact with the girly boy.\n\n\"I don't like the sun... this is scary.\" Gasper whispered lowly to himself, knowing that Naruto wouldn't give a crap if he was comfy with the outside or not. If Naruto was making him come outside so that he could get used to the outside world, then he wouldn't have much of a choice in the matter. His butt still hurt from the smacks Naruto had given him earlier thanks to him squirming attempts to escape his fate. His free hand went to his butt and began to rub it lightly to sooth what was left of the stinging sensation. He had only once been spanked by Rias before this time, and that was because he had accidently tripped and broke one of her prized DVD's of her secret anime hobby. She had spanked him a few times, and the pain faded almost immediently after. With Naruto the pain lasted quite awhile after you got smacked.\n\nNaruto was humming a song to himself with his smile bright and wide, not being able to go outside often thanks to his power made him sort of an indoor cat. He truly apprreciated the moments like this when he could enojoy the warmth of the sun on his skin, and the light rays warming up his white locks that spiked in every direction. It was in his nature to like sunlight, despite the fact it conflicted with the added nature of the devil side of him hating sunlight. Naruto had always been much more Nekoshou than he was devil, while Koneko chose to be more devil than Nekoshou. She refused herself many of the things that he used to love about being a cat, like bathing in the sunlight.\n\n\"Get over it Gasper, this walk will do you some good. If I have to I will spank you in front of everyone here... or prank you nya.\" Naruto said with a sly smile, his eyes glowing demically as they lit up with the feeling of the prankster lighting up inside him again. The last time that Gasper had seen that look, all of his girl's clothes had been replaced with men's clothes. Gasper shivered in the memory of how itchy all of those were to him, and how thankful he was when Naruto was told to give him his clothes back by Rias.\n\n\"Please don't prank me, I will be a good boy.\" Gasper pleaded like he was about to become a dying man, which wasn't far off when considering that he could die of embarrassment if Naruto decided to up the level of his pranks. Naruto was known as the Prankster Hellcat among the Gremory Household thanks to how infamous his pranks had become, and nobody was safe from these pranks. Not even Sirzechs was safe, nor was he able to look the color purple without shivering slightly. Gasper had no idea how Naruto had gotten a Satan to fear a color, but once Sirzechs had loved the color purple, but now he avoided it like the plague.\n\nNaruto puffed his chest out in pride at the fear in the other boy's eyes, before he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. Just out of his sensing range was Issei Hyoudou, with some strange girl. Naruto blinked a few times and started to scratch his head in confusion when he noticed something really off about the girl that Issei was with, but he couldn't place his finger on it exactly. They were just out of his range though, so he wasn't able to feel them even though he could see them. He could take his hand off Gasper's hand, but that would end up with him feeling the feelings of thousands of people rushing into his head at the same time.\n\n\"Is that Issei? Hey Gasper, you should go back to Rias. Something feels... of about that girl. I will follow them around and see if I can find anything out.\" Naruto stated as he vanished in a quick poof of smoke, and in his place was a very small kitten with golden eyes. The top of the kitten's head had white fur on it that was styled in a messy pattern much like how his hair formed in humanoid form. Naruto fell to the ground and landed on his paws with a very soft sigh, while Gasper's eyes widened at how Naruto transformed into a cute kitten.\n\n\"Are you okay, you were throwing up earlier because of your sensing power?\" Gasper was able to withstand the urge to run away from the sunlight out of concern for Naruto, while the kitten shaped Naruto smirked lightly.\n\n\"I will be fine, as a kitten my emotions change enough so that my power is much less accurate and potent. Don't worry much about me, so long as I don't get attacked while in this form I will be fine. Just go and warn Rias that something strange is happening nya.\" Naruto ordered lightly to the Dhampire, not knowing what was going on with Issei worried him slightly. Now that the only two devils in the city with the ability to reincarnate people couldn't bring him back if he was killed, Issei was in much danger for his status as the user of an apparently powerful Sacred Gear. Naruto started to run towards the boy and strange girl while Gasper began to run in the direction of the clubroom.\n\nNaruto managed to get closer to the two of them, and immediently the girl sent Naruto a dirty look while Issei wasn't looking. Her long black hair seemed to turn blacker, and her purple eyes held malicious intent in them. The eyes became kind again when Issei looked at the girl and then saw Naruto on the ground nearby them. Issei grinned and got down on his knees and held a hand out to Naruto.\n\n\"Well isn't this little guy just the cutest... huh, he kind of looks like somebody I know. This your kitten Yuuma?\" Issei asked the girl that was apparently being called Yuuma. Naruto took this chance and jumped into Issei's hands so that he could stay right next to them. Naruto sat down on Issei's shoulder, and started to stare at Yuuma with a mocking look. She clicked her teeth with an annoyed glare at the cat, before she smiled at Issei again.\n\n\"I'm not much of a cat person Issei, but it looks like she likes you.\" Yuuma pointed out the fact that Naruto was pretty much genderless in this form, which sadly made it appear than he was female even though his soul was still male. Sometimes being genderless when you were in cat form was pretty annoying, this was one of those times.\n\n'I will eat your soul, and send your body straight to the abyss.' Naruto sent a telepathic message right into this 'Yuuma' girl's head. She grit her teeth even tighter at how annoying he was being to her. It was easy to see that she hated Naruto right now, and the fact that her target was right next to him was making this more difficult for her to get rid of him. Naruto was able to sense this, so he jumped up onto Issei's head and made himself comfy. He stuck his tongue out at her, and she nearly lost it at how obviously he was taunting her.\n\n\"Issei hun, why don't you place that cat on the ground so that we can get back to our date?\" Yuuma asked kindly, while Issei just laughed and tried to remove Naruto from his head, only to find out that Naruto scratched his hand the second he brought it to close. He pulled his hand back and hissed in pain lightly, before he noticed something strange about the cut on his hand. Looking at it for a moment, his gaze shifted to Yuuma with a slight suspcious look in his eyes.\n\n_Bad Girl_\n\n'What the hell? These scratches spell out a warning.' Issei thought in shock as he looked at the scratches that started to bleed and cover up the writing. He looked up at the small amount of white in his vision, as well as the black in Yuuma's hair. For a moment he pictured a great evil about her, for a second that is.\n\n'Good, he seems to be getting it.' Naruto thought, before the look of realization was wiped from his face when Yuuma pressed her breasts against his arm. She used his perversion against him and wiped his suspisions from head. Naruto grit his teeth lightly, before he was knocked from Issei's head and landed on the ground with his feet when he saw that Yuuma was grinning down at him. Naruto hissed at Yuuma, before he was forced back away when Yuuma 'dropped' a silver cross in front of him. Crosses was something that he couldn't stand because of the pain they caused his half devil nature.\n\n\"Hey Issei, you know what, there is this perfect chance for you and I to bond. How about we go to the church, there are some pretty neat statues there I want to show you?\" Yuuma asked with a large, yet slightly evil, smile on her face that only appeared evil when Issei was looking away. The second he looked at her that smile turned purely kind hearted, and the brown haired Sacred Gear holder blushed while chuckling to himself lightly. The small kitten on the ground was completely forgotten by him, but he was not forgotten by Naruto when the boy turned cat rushed around the cross on the ground and started to claw at Issei's leg to get his attention.\n\nThe second the boy entered that Church, Naruto would be unable to help him should Yuuma try and kill him.\n\n'Damnit brat, if you continue to fall for her sweater mellons you will find yourself on the business end of a shit stick.' Naruto sent a strong message of mental strength to Issei in the hopes that the pervy boy would resist the urge of titties, and find a way to save himself. The second Naruto transformed into a humanoid form he would be assaulted with thousands of emotions, and his ability to battle would be cut down by 80 percent when it came to the ability to react in time to dodge an attack. Against a Light User that was a fatal issue that he knew he would need to work around soon, otherwise he would be useless against opponents that could use a devils weakness against them.\n\n\"Sure thing, lets go!\" Issei said in excitement, not even noticing the strong message in his head, or the kitten scratching at his pants. The boy started to walk with Yuuma, while she stuck her tongue out at Naruto when Issei wasn't looking at her. Naruto's eyes narrowed at that, and when they were out of sight he tried to think of a way to get Issei out of trouble, but sadly nothing was coming to him. Naruto blinked a few times when an idea actually did come to his head, of course after Sona had tried to get Issei into her peerage he had been made aware of the existance of the supernatural, even if he wasn't a devil, angel, or fallen angel.\n\nNaruto couldn't go to the church himself, but there was somebody that could go in his place. Somebody that would follow his every order to the dot, just because of the fact that he gave the order.\n\n\"Hehehe, so you think this has me beat nya? Well you can go suck it.\" Naruto said as a purple magic circle appeared under his white cat form, and in a poof of smoke his own familiar appeared on the ground under him. Not only was his familiar under him, but now Naruto was back in humanoid form without having to worry about getting a mental overload. Naruto grinned lightly when the smoke fully cleared from his familiar.\n\nStanding in front of Naruto was a small dragon standing at about a foot tall, the little dragon was blue scaled with burning red eyes. It's face was a much lighter blue color, and it's eyes were sharp on top while curved on bottom. The wings were about half the length of the dragon's body, and it stood on it's two thick back legs. It's front claws were narrow and smaller, while it had a reptile tail with a devil tip on the end of it. On each foot and claw were three sharp claws, and it's stomach was the same color as it's face. It's head was shaped with three points, one on each side of the head, and one on top.\n\nThis was the Sprite Dragon that Naruto had as his familiar, and she had tha natural ability to cancel out his empathy based powers as long as he stood within her natural EM field that was created by the eletricity she generated. While it might not look like it, this dragon was Lightning Based and always had a powerful EMF (Electro Magnetic Field) around it that could be used to cancel out his powers while he was within the field.\n\nSprite Dragons only became the familiars of pure hearted people, which proved that Naruto's heart was pure based off of the fact that this was his personal familiar that chose him to be her master. Normally, a Sprite Dragon would NEVER become a devil's familiar, but because she sensed the purity in his heart she had chosen him a few years back. Since then she had been his more loyal of his two familiars, this other was loyal... so long as Naruto met the condition that the other one had set for terms of summoning. Yep, he could only summon his second familiar under the terms that had been set, or when his life was in terrible danger. The second one meant that he couldn't use his second familiar in Rating Games, and because of how... humiliating the first condition was for him he couldn't do the first one in Rating Games because of the fact that people actually watched those.\n\n\"Raigeki, I want you to go and make sure that boy doesn't die. If you have to, kill the woman with him, but only as a last resort.\" Naruto made sure that his order was clear, his familiar... was a very prissy girl when she wanted to be. It would seem that Sprite Dragons were not naturally fond of beings that were the same gender as they were, while they liked people from the opposite gender. Raigeki had electrocuted the hell out of Rias, Akeno, Koneko, AND Kuroka when they each had met the small dragon.\n\nRaigeki closed her eyes, before she hopped up into Naruto's arms and started to rub her face into his chest. Naruto rubbed the familiar's head with a smile, before his familiar nodded and started to fly away in the other direction. Naruto frowned and let a red magical circle appear under his body, the magical circle that belonged to the Gremory family. His body started to turn into red magical particals before he was absorbed into the circle and teleported back to the clubroom.\n\nHe could find what he was looking for later, because right now something strange was going on.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Naruto has an affinity for Dragons because of Ophis 'blessing' him before he was reborn.**_  \n_**Raigeki -Translates- Lightning Strike**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t9. Chapter 9 Evil Set\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**This Chapter has some IMPORTANT information in it.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"There is nothing we can do about it Naruto, if Issei went into the Church he is on his own. I won't risk any of my peerage's safety for somebody I don't know. Issei can fend for himself, you sending your familiar to help him is the best we can do for him.\" Rias told Naruto the second he finished his story, while he gripped his fist slightly. He didn't know why, but he had always been a little bit irritable when it came to abandoning people he considered his friends. He would be willing to die for his friends, which made him the perfect member of the Gremory House, but it also put him at risk when he risked more than just his life to save people.\n\n\"Perv Pants can fend for himself.\" Koneko agreed with Rias on the general idea of Issei being left to defend against the Fallen Angel on his own. Katase and Murayama looked confused as to what was going on, and noticing their confusion Yuuto smiled at the two fellow sword users and sat on the couch nearby them.\n\n\"As Devils, we are the natural enemies of anything to do with the Church. Daylight weakens us slightly, and crosses, holy water, light based magic, the bible, as well as a few other things can hurt us. Fallen Angels and Angels are also enemies we have to watch out for because of our opposing natures.\" Yuuto explained with a sour look on his face at the mention of all of their weaknesses. Devils got the short end of the stick with that one, they had the weaknesses that both of their enemies races could easily take advantage of. It was sort of unfair, but they were able to make do just as well.\n\n\"That... sucks. I don't get why you are worried about the perv though.\" Murayama pointed out with her hand going to the handle of her new sword at the thought of Issei. She was not a fan of the peeping tom, but that also didn't mean she exactly wanted him to die. He was a human after all, so why would one of these Fallen Angels even want to have anything to do with him for. It was kind of strange, the boy was weaker than them, and they were newly minted devils. They had been stronger than him as humans, which was sad because Issei never really decided to work out. He could have been pretty strong and respectable if he hadn't sent his life with his every being revolving around porn and boobs.\n\n\"Technically, it isn't Issei that Buchou is worried about. We have recently learned that Issei has inside him a Sacred Gear, and object that humans are gifted with at birth that will give them advantages down the road in life. Some of the greatest men and women in history had Sacred Gears making them smarter, stronger, and overall better than the humans surrounding them.\" Akeno explained to help them understand the situation. The situation was worse than they would think, while Issei was a human, it was very much possible to extract a Sacred Gear from somebody, and a powerful Sacred Gear in the hands of the enemy was something that they couldn't ignore.\n\n\"That perv has something amazing in him? I can't believe that.\" Katase said neutrally, waving her hands in denial that the pervert that peeped at them changing could have something cool inside him.\n\n\"Look can be fooling, Yuuto has two Sacred Gears but he doesn't even look like he could lift his own weight. I don't act it, but I come from a very noble family. Akeno hides it, but she is REALLY into S&M play with her enemies.\" Rias explained to the two new girls in the peerage, while Naruto sulked lightly at them forgetting what they were talking about at first. Sitting down in Akeno's lap and resting his head between her breasts, he allowed himself to try and figure out what kind of Sacred Gear would interest the Fallen Angels enough to make them even try and go after Issei.\n\n\"Thats right, I love making my enemies squirm around before begging for the sweet mercy of death! A little lightning here, and a few fireballs there before the enemy is crying delicious tears of pain.\" Akeno said as she traced her lower lip with her finger. A seductive look on her face to go with the blush she had on, while her eyes became slightly lidded. Naruto shivered when he noticed her breath start to come in a quickened pace against his head, and he slightly regret chosing this as his sitting place today.\n\n'Okay... maybe Issei isn't as much of a perv when compared to others.' Murayama thought with a light pained feeling at having to admit that Issei wasn't the biggest pervert around. At least with him you only had to deal with him peeping at you, he never had the guts to actually try anything with you. This girl, the one they had looked up to, was so much more perverted than Issei could ever hope to be. Possibly, it was impossible to see the future after all, which would mean that Issei could one day be more perverted than Akeno.\n\n\"Back to the issue.\" Koneko reminded Rias that there really was an issue at the moment, while Naruto sent his sister a loving and thankful look so that she knew that he was thankful for her getting them back on topic.\n\n\"Yes, anyway, Issei has a very powerful Sacred Gear in him. It might not be very accurate, but we use Pawns to see how powerful a Sacred Gear's base is. Kiba here was worth a Knight, or three Pawns, meaning his Sacred Gears aren't extremely powerful by nature. He is only this strong by training, but Issei was worth EIGHT Pawns if Sona was telling the truth. That means he had an amazingly powerful Sacred Gear inside him, possible one of the 13 Longinus if I am guessing right.\" Rias explained with a frown on her face. High Level Sacred Gears were worth 5 through 8 Pawns. Normally people had to sacrifice two pieces that were worth 3 Pawns, like two Knights or two Bishops. She didn't have the amount needed to reincarnate Issei into her peerage, but she truly wanted to have that Sacred Gear in her team. A Longinus level Sacred Gear could be so helpful to her future goals.\n\n\"Longinus? I don't understand that term, is it something special to Sacred Gears?\" Katase asked with a questioning tone, she was very new to being a devil. She had no idea what any of these terms were refering to, while Rias sighed and gestured to Naruto for an explaination.\n\n\"The 13 Longinus are said to have the ability to grant the user the ability to kill even gods if they were powerful enough, power like that isn't something that can be underestimated. Issei has the potential to gain enough power to be a very powerful person, but he is also a target by those that don't want him to reach his potential... or those that want that Gear for themselves. If they get that Gear from him, then Issei will lose his life.\" Naruto stated before he blinked, a crazy idea forming in his mind that might save Issei's life later. If this worked then it was possible that they could benefit from this, and Issei wouldn't have to die. Rias saw the look on his face, and knew that he had a good idea for her.\n\n\"Yes, Issei will die if he loses his Sacred Gear. That is the fate of Sacred Gear users, those that are different will always live lives that are cursed with some kind of downside. Everyone wants one, but nobody realized that having one powerful enough to matter paints a target on your back.\" Yuuto said sadly, knowing what it was like for somebody to be after him for his Sacred Gear's abilities. Naruto nodded as well, he knew what it was like to be targeted because he was different. Nekoshou were a race of Yokai that were born and lived in the Underworld for the most part, which made them strange among both devils and yokai.\n\n\"Then why aren't we rushing over to save him?!\" Murayama shouted when she realized just how dangerous this situation had become. Naruto jumped off of Akeno's lap, and went over to the freaking out girl's lap and made himself a new and surprisinglyu more comfy seat out of her thighs. She looked down at him, before she calmed down slightly.\n\n\"We can't, Angels and Fallen Angels uses Churches and abandoned Churches as their bases of operation, which makes them enemy ground. We have a very shaky stand off going on right now, and the smallest thing can break it and cause another war between the three factions. Naruto's familiar is trying to take care of things because she isn't technically a devil, which means that she doesn't have the same weaknesses to holy places and objects as us.\" Rias stated calmly, Raigeki made be a pissy little dragon with females, but she was a very loyal dragon to Naruto. She also helped him out with her EMF, so it helped that he could enter a crowd of devils as long as he had her with him. The downside was that he couldn't sense emotions so it was sort of 'blinding' to him.\n\n\"Then we have nothing to worry about then right?\" Katase asked, her jealosuly over Murayama holding onto Naruto getting the better of her when she saw how her friend was holding his head to her chest.\n\n\"Yes, we do. Raigeki isn't powerful enough to take on a group of Fallen Angels if there is a group, if there is only one she can do it, but if there are more then she will just be able to try and get Issei here as fast as possible.\" Naruto said while hiding a grin on his face, even if Issei died it wasn't like they couldn't bring him back. What made Issei worth so much to turn into a Pawn was because of his Sacred Gear, BUT if he didn't have that Sacred Gear inside him they would be able to get him into the group with only a single Pawn. Of course, if they brought him back without putting his Sacred Gear inside him first it was possible he would never be able to get it back, but that was a small price to pay. If it could be placed back inside him, then they would be able to get a Longinus for the price of a SINGLE Pawn.\n\nNaruto would be the first to admit that this was a great deal, getting a Longinus user for the price of one Pawn was simply too good of a chance to pass up. Sure, his potential would be much smaller than if they used the full eight Pawns, but he still had a Longinus. That was simply to good of a chance to pass up, and he would need to explain his plan to Rias.\n\nIf they couldn't bring him back at all, they would just have to steal the Sacred Gear from the Fallen Angels and save it for later when they could make good use of it. He HATED thinking about things like this, or considering Issei to be a tool, but at this point he didn't have much option. Issei was already in the Church, where they would risk war by directly going there to help him. If they stole a stolen object from a Fallen Angel they would not risk war, and if they brought back a dead human as a devil they wouldn't be risking war either.\n\nNot only would all the be amazing, but Rias would still have five Pawns left. That would mean she could have up to five more Pawns, another Bishop, and another Knight. That was seven more pieces, which meant she would have a very unique set for her peerage.\n\nNaruto was trickier than people gave him credit for, even more so when it came to getting things that could be important at a later date. Of course, this was all in the hopes that Issei's body didn't get destroyed in the process, extracting stronger Sacred Gears had the chance of ripping the inside of the body, which could end up in Issei's body being destroyed behind the ability to fix.\n\nIt was all a gamble, and it was Issei's fault for not resisting the titties that he could die. If Naruto had been able to act like he wanted to then Issei wouldn't be in this situation, but sadly he had more than himself to consider in this. His actions reflected on Rias and her family, and Issei wasn't as important to him as they were.\n\n\"Familiar?\" Katase asked when she realized that had been a term that had been used during this conversation, while Rias nodded with her smile returned to her face.\n\n\"Familiars are creatures that we can contract as our helpers, they do what we want them to do. It is sort of like a right of passage to ally yourself with one. I have one, Yuuto has one, Koneko has one, Akeno has a small family as little demons, and Naruto has two familiars... one of which he can't summon most of the time.\" Rias desribed to the girl's, both of which saw Naruto blush lightly and bury his face in Murayama's chest to hide his embarrassed blush. He should have never shown Rais his second familiar, he was really regretting that choice. The price was just too humiliating for him to do half of the time.\n\n\"Are we going to get familiars?\" Katase asked as she pointed to her and her best friend, who also seemed to be excited at the thought of having somebody lower on the totem pole than her.\n\n\"Not yet, right now you should both raise your power enough so that you can handle the strain having a familiar places on you. In a few weeks maybe, and around a dozen more contracts before I would even begin to think you are ready. So yes, eventaully you will get a familiar.\" Rias spoke with her usual tone, letting them know that they would be getting familiars eventaully... just not today. After the last time they went familiar hunting with somebody that wasn't ready they had been forced to retreat. She wasn't about to immediently try and get her peerage newbies familiars right away again.\n\n\"Don't worry to much about it though, Pawns are very important in chess, and in Rating Games they are just as important.\" Naruto stated to calm the two girls down, his head now out of Murayama's breasts with his blush gone. The two girls seemed to be confused again, and Koneko sighed before she gave the two of them a deadpan look.\n\n\"Rating Games are ways for devils to compete and show their strength, and raise up in rank through impressive feats of battle. The better you make yourself look, and show of your power, in a Rating Game the more likely you are to be considered for a promotion to a higher status.\" Koneko explained to the Pawns of the ground, and with a nod Rias decided to pick up where Koneko left off, knowing that the two girls wouldn't understand the big deal about Rank either.\n\n\"In the Underworld your status is given a rank. The lowest being a Low Class Devil, and the highest being an Ultimate Class. In between them are the Middle Class and High Class. There are evn ranks within the ranks.\" Rias stated as she brought out a chart using magic, and drew a picture of a triangle with multiple colored sections inside of it. The top section said Ultimate Class, under it was High Class, with Middle Class under that, and finally Low Class at the very bottom.\n\nUltimate Class - Demon Lord, Great King, Arch Duke, Duke, Prince/Princess  \nHigh Class - Marquess, Margrave/Margavine, Count/Countess, Viscount/Viscountess, Baron/Baroness  \nMiddle Class - Baronet/Baroness, Knight/Dame  \nLow Class\n\n\"Well known fact, but among devils the House of Gremory is given the title of Duke. Making them the fourth highest rank among devils. Rias doesn't have her family rank yet, but she was born a High Class Devil because she comes from one of the 72 Pillar Families. She doesn't really have a rank among High Class though.\" Akeno explained with a smile on her face, while Rias nodded without getting insulted by her lack of true rank. She hadn't done anything to earn her rank, but that didn't really bother her as much as it used to.\n\n\"Small note, but when a devil becomes a High Class devil they are usually given the chance to gain their own Evil Pieces and get their own peerage. Of course, if Rias were to ever need us in a Rating Game we would still have to help her.\" Yuuto explained to the less confused girls, and everything was starting to make sense to them now that it was being explained more clearly.\n\n\"Okay, but what rank are the rest of you?\" Murayama asked with a truly curious expression on her face, so Rias cleared her throat and made a second chart next to her rankings chart. She started to write down names so that it would be easy for them to understand, and next to the names she placed ranks.\n\nRias Gremory - High Class  \nNaruto Toujou - Middle Class - Baronet  \nAkeno Himejime - Low Class  \nKoneko Toujou - Low Class  \nYuuto Kiba - Low Class  \nGasper Vladi - Low Class\n\n\"You two are Low Class as well, and the closest to getting to High Class at the moment is the Queen here. He was given the chance to promote when he was younger thanks to some pretty amazing feats and contracts he was able to pull off. One more promotion and he will be allowed to gain his own peerage, but if I am ever in a Rating Game he will have to fight for me again.\" Rias explained with a thumb pointing at Naruto, using him as an example of the fact that gaining power didn't change the fact that he was in somebodies peerage. Naruto shrugged, not really caring what rank he was. He only took those promotion exams because he wanted to stop being a low class, and with it stop being understimated as much.\n\n\"The 72 Pillar Families, that sounds like a lot of families.\" Katase groaned out, while Naruto decided to show them that he did have some knowledge that people wouldn't expect.\n\n\"Yep, and they are the Bael, Argares, Vassago, Gamigin, Marbas, Valefor, Amon, Barbatos, Paimon, Buer, Gusion, Sitri, Beleth, Leraje, Eligos, Zepar, Botis, Bathin, Sallos, Purson, Marax, Ipos, Aim, Naberius, Glasya-Labolas, Bune, Ronove, Berith, Astaroth, Forneus, Foras, Asmoday, Gaap, Furfur, Marchosias, Stolas, Phenex, Halphas, Malphas, Raim, Focalor, Wepel, Sabnock, Shax, Vine, Bifrons, Uvall, Haagenti, Crocell, Furcas, Balam, Alocer, Caim, Murmur, Orobas, Gremory, Ose, Amy, Oriax, Vapula, Zagan, Valac, Abdras, Flauros, Andrealphus, Cimeries, Amduscias, Belial, Decarabia, Seere, Dantalion, and finally Andromalius. Crap that was a mouthfull.\" Naruto said as he took a deep gulp of air, having managed to say that entire list with a single breath was something that he was going to brag about later when he had the chance. That was not going to be happening again anytime soon.\n\n\"As long as that list is, you won't have to remember them all. Only 34 of the 72 Pillar Families still retain their status. Either the other families were wiped out, or their blood became mixed with human blood and they lost their status.\" Rias explained with her eyebrow still raised at the fact that naruto ahd the entire 72 families known by memory. even she could brag about being able to say them all without pausing to remember a few of them that no longer exist.\n\n\"The Bael is considered the most powerful family... you know, Buchou's mother is from the Bael family. That is how she was born with the Power of Destruction that the Bael family were born with. The Gremory family were all born with high magic reserves and great control over those reserves.\" Akeno stated as a fact with a slight smirk towards a smirking Rias, who was holding a black and red flame in her hand before she threw it towards a potted plant... that was evaporated instantly the second it made contact with the plant. Showing just how powerful her magic was.\n\n\"Of course, just because you are Low Class doesn't mean that you are automatically weaker than the other classes. Akeno here is a Low Class, and she is able to fight on par with me half of the time thanks to how hard she trained herself.\" Rias explained, while Akeno placed a hand to her blushing cheek with a graceful smile on her face.\n\nNaruto was smiling as well, because he only had one more promotion to go before he would be a High Class like Rias. He wished that Koneko had been given the same chance he had for promotion, but she had never been as good at making contracts as him... at least when it came to impressive contracts. Naruto blinked when he realized something that had happened again.\n\nThey had completely forgotten that they were talking about Issei in the first place.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t10. Chapter 10 Critical Changes\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Nyahahaha! Finally the time for you to call on me has come!\" Kuroka shouted towards her younger sister from inside the shared apartment of Naruto and Koneko. Kuroka had teleported into their home the second that Koneko had called onto her for help on the issue involving Naruto's growing ability to sense emotions. Koneko was sitting on the couch with a sour expression on her face, before Kuroka jumped onto the couch next to her and wrapped and arm around her little sister. She gave her little sister a good shake and started to grin at being needed by somebody other than Sirzechs or Naruto.\n\nShe had forced herself to take some time off spying just for the chance to help her sister, while Koneko sighed and prepared herself to get teased. Kuroka ALWAYS teased people for some of the simplest things these days, it was in her nature, and she knew this when calling Kuroka for help.\n\n\"Stop joking around Onee-SAN.\" Koneko stated, while putting as much stress on the san in her title to Koneko. Surprisingly Kuroka nodded lightly and just started to calm herself down, if Koneko was calling her for something then she must really be needed.\n\n\"Got it nya, so what is the issue nya?\" Kuroka asked with concern hidden deeply in her voice, it would never be said that Kuroka was very good at showing how worried she was half of the time. Koneko took a deep breath and looked at her sister with her more serious than normal face, because her face was always serious it was hard to tell the difference for those that didn't understand her tell signs.\n\n\"Otouto's powers are growing to the point they are affecting him negatively, do you know a way to stop it or suppress them?\" Koneko questioned her older sibling, getting right to the point. Kuroka frowned lightly for a moment when she tried to consider Koneko's words. She scratched her chin in though for a few moments, wondering if she should reveal what she did know to Koneko. Deciding it would be best to reveal the information to at least her younger sister, she took a deep breath.\n\n\"His powers are in an unstable state right now, a state of growing. I recently brought this up to another person, and he told me that he had suspected for awhile now that Naruto-kun had been gifted with a form of Sacred Gear. His Emotion Sensing abilities stem from his Sacred Gear, but until his Sacred Gear activates he won't be able to fully control, turn on and off, his powers at will.\" Kuroka explained with a frown on her face, knowing there was a problem with no current solution was annoying to her. There were ways to block out other people from Naruto's mind, but that would mean that he would have no access to his ability at all. Any method that they could use to help him would also cause him trouble, his current method of focusing on one person was good enough at the moment.\n\nAfter all, the only reason Naruto has trouble with his ability are times when he is surrounded by literally hundreds or thousands of people. The stress of those many emotions were what caused him the trouble, or those rare cases when a person was so filled with hate an insanity that they caused Naruto to become sick from the extremely conflicting emotions.\n\n\"Sacred Gear, that's impossible. Only humans can be born with those.\" Koneko denied right off the bat, while Kuroka shook her head at her sister.\n\n\"Wrong, that only applies to the Sacred Gears created by the Biblical God. The ones that were made by other types of God's can be gifted to certain species of their choice, while it is true that a pure blooded devil can't be born with a Sacred Gear Naruto, you, and I are not devils by birth, nor am I a devil at all. That means that if a type of God wants to give us a Sacred Gear when we are born it is possible, but unlikely nya.\" Kuroka explained very carefully to her doubtful sibling. The entire thing sounded farfecthed to her, but she had to admit that there were times when weird things happened around Naruto. Like that Sun and Infinity symbol that would occasionally show up on the palm of his right hand.\n\n\"You are sure?\" Koneko asked, making sure that Kuroka was completely sure about this before she trusted her answer. Kuroka nodded before she reached in between her cleavage and pulled out a small collar. She handed it to Koneko, and the white haired girl looked at the strange collar with a frown on her face. The collar was small enough that it would only fit around either her neck, or Naruto's neck. She guessed that it was for Naruto, because it was made from a black leather material. On the front of the collar was a small small glowing green gem, and inside the gem there seemed to be a small amount of electricity inside of it.\n\n\"That is a collar with Crystalized Lightning as the base nya. It has a high enough electrical field that it should completely negate his powers, unless he is touching somebody he won't be able to sense emotions. That means he can't use his powers when he is wearing that, so no sensing ability to help him nya.\" Kuroka warned her sister of the drawbacks of helping Naruto in this way. That collar was something that she had gotten for herself a long time ago to help her sneak passed people with emotion sensing abilities, and now she was going to have Koneko give it to their little brother to help him negate his own powers. Koneko looked at the stone and nodded lightly in understanding, if Naruto wore this then he wouldn't be able to sense emotions of people he wasn't touching anymore.\n\nThat wasn't fixing the problem, it was just like giving him a medicine for it. If his powers grew too strong it was possible that he would start to sense emotions again.\n\n\"I see, and how did you get this. Crystalized Lightning is pretty expensive, expensive enough to put a rich family in the poor house.\" Koneko questioned with narrowed eyes, and Kuroka chuckled nervously. That was a question that she did NOT want to answer right now, or at all. Having this was pretty bad for her, so she was happy to get rid of it to somebody that would actually need it now. Kuroka bent down and kissed her sister on the cheek, before she jumped back and vanished into the shadows of the apartment. Koneko touched her kissed cheek, before she frowned and looked at the collar in her hand. She didn't like it, but she knew that Kuroka wouldn't play a cruel trick on her by denying either other her siblings help. That would mean that this think was able to help her out with Naruto.\n\nA flash of red showed a magic circle floating in the air, and seconds later a VERY annoyed Naruto was seen walking through the magic circle before the red teleporter vanished into nothing. Koneko didn't need emotion sensing powers to tell that her brother was in a pretty bad mood over something.\n\nShe got her answer moments later when she saw him throw a red item onto the chair nearby the couch, she looked at the object closer and saw that it was a red gauntlet type of item with a green gem in the center of the gauntless. Two spikes of yellow jet out of the gauntlet and pointed towards the back end of the item, while the rest of the object was designed very similar to a dragon's scales in a way.\n\n\"Twice Critical, the guys Sacred Gear was a fricking Twice Critical!\" Naruto said with an angry stomp on the ground at the fact that when Raigeki had come back with Issei's body she had also brought along with her the abandoned Sacred Gear that the Fallen Angel that had stolen it didn't even want anymore. Seriously, once the Fallen Angels had discovered that the Sacred Gear was only a Twice Critical they said 'screw it' and threw the damn thing away. Raigeki was easily able to retrieve both the Sacred Gear and Issei's body and bring them back the the clubroom after Issei had been killed.\n\n\"So I take it the perv is dead?\" Koneko asked to make sure, while Naruto huffed and hopped onto the couch with another glare at the Sacred Gear for causing so much trouble for them.\n\n\"Yeah, the Fallen Angel killed him to get his Sacred Gear... but they didn't want a Twice Critical and threw it away. Rias has already brought Issei back as a Pawn, but now the stupid Gear is refusing to become a part of Issei again. Try touching it.\" Naruto suggested as he pointed at the Sacred Gear on the chair. Finding something weird about the way he said that, Koneko walked over to the chair and placed her hand on the Sacred Gear, only for her to draw back her hand right after touching the Gear like she was burned. Her hand was smoking slightly from touching the Sacred Gear, and she was looking at it in shock.\n\n\"That sucks, it is hot.\" Koneko said with a light scowl to Naruto for making her touch something that was that hot. Naruto shook his head and walked over to the Sacred Gear and picked it up like it was nothing.\n\n\"It isn't hot, it is being very picky about who can touch it. Only Issei, Raigeki, and myself are able to touch this thing without getting burnt. I think it won't let itself be used by anyone that doesn't have a connection to a dragon of some form. I have a pretty strong affinity to Dragons, Raigeki is a dragon, and being the original user Issei has an affinity for it.\" Naruto said with a toss as he put the Sacred Gear right back onto the chair. Calming himself down before he exploded over something small, he allowed himself to think about the good parts of having Issei as a fellow member of Rias' peerage. Naruto sweat dropped when he realized that right now there really wasn't anything special about having Issei as a member of the team. He was just another Pawn right now because of his old Sacred Gear refusing to allow anyone to use it.\n\nFor a Twice Critical, the thing was pretty picky about who was allowed to touch it and use it.\n\n\"Wow, Gear with attitude.\" Koneko said with a raised eyebrow to the picky Sacred Gear. Naruto was just upset that he had thought that Sacred Gear was on of the 13 Longinus, something that was understandable to be upset about.\n\n\"Yeah, and to make things worse Issei needs to be trained to the normal level of a Pawn. Right now he is weaker than Riser's weakest Pawn, so he is like zero help for a Rating Game. He may be only one Pawn, but it was a Pawn wasted right now... until he get training to form some kind of useful skill.\" Naruto stated with an annoyed sigh. Of course, he wasn't saying Issei was completely hopeless. It was very much possible that he would get a skill that he would be able to use during a Rating Game, but right now he had no such skill.\n\n\"Why would a Twice Critical be worth 8 Pawns?\" Koneko asked, while Naruto sighed and glared at the thing. If it had a personality then it would be considered a living being, so this Gear was actually worth 7 Pawns, while Issei was worth a single Pawn. Together they added up to 8 Pawns, but they reincarnated Issei without the Gear so it was only a price of 1 Pawn to turn Issei to their side.\n\n\"Who knows why, but it might just be a stubborn Twice Critical. It must have been resisting the changing process for Sona and increasing the price of Pawns needed nya.\" Naruto explained with best possible idea he had to explain it. He didn't need the Sacred Gear, and Issei wasn't strong enough where it would be any good to him even if he could use it properly. Right now they would just need to find something to do with it, Rias had given it to him and told him to do with it what he wanted. Naruto grinned lightly when he went over to the Gear and placed his hand on the green gem. This thing was being stubborn, so Naruto would show it who was boss by flooding it with his own power.\n\nHe could feel the Sacred Gear's emotions by touching it, and the thing seemed to be upset over recently being removed from it's proper owner. Naruto sent a burst of energy through it, and the green gem absorbed the energy right away. Naruto blinked at how it absorbed his energy and seemed to get more powerful, and Koneko noticed his confusion.\n\n'What was that?' The older sister wondered when she saw Naruto sent another pulse of his power into the Sacred Gear. Both of them jumped back in the surprised when the entire thing started to glow.\n\n_Dragon BOOST!_\n\nThey both blinked when they heard a voice shout out from the Sacred Gear, and when the light died down they were able to see the Sacred Gear's new form. The entire things had changed to a deeper red color, and had become more gauntlet-like than before. Before it was larger and thicker, but this one was more like an armored red glove that had sharp red armored fingers and a green gem on top of the hand. The thing looked like ti would cover a good part of a person's forearm, and the yellow spikes moved to the back of the glove, with smaller red spikes going up the sides. The five fingers on the armored gauntlet were now more claw-like, while the armor on the forearm of the gauntlet became more scale-like.\n\n\"It... wasn't a Twice Critical... Fuck YEAH!\" Naruto shouted while pumping his fist in the air. He should have known that he was right the first time he had guessed that this would be a good Sacred Gear. It may have looked like a Twice Critical at first to everyone, but this was a much more powerful Dragon Based gear than it originally looked. This was NOT a Twice Critical, this was the Boosted Gear!\n\nThe Boosted Gear was a powerful Longinus that could double the user's power every 10 seconds, and inside it was said to be a very strong dragon sealed away. It was not the strongest Longinus, but it was a powerful one. Naruto almost laughed at how the Fallen Angels had literally thrown away such a powerful tool out of the idea that it was a simply Twice Critical. Yeah, he had made a similar mistake, but he found it funny that the actually threw away a Longinus because of how it looked on the outside.\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" Koneko asked the number one question, while Naruto was honestly stumped at that one. He had no idea what he was going to do with it, and using it wasn't something he really wanted to do for himself. Naruto shrugged and picked up the Sacred Gear before he placed it under the couch, he would leave it there until he could think of what he should do with it. At the moment nothing really came into his mind, because he knew that the Boosted Gear came at the cost of stamina, the more you used it the quicker it drained your stamina. Of course, he had a lot of stamina, but that didn't mean he could waste his stamina like an idiot by relying on a Sacred Gear to do his work for him.\n\nHe actually LIKED to train himself.\n\n_**Chapter End**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**The Next Questions will be answer ayt Ch.15**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\nFan letter to Naruto the likely 'Second in Command of Rias' Peerage'  \n\"Does your emotion sensing power not hinder your battle performance when facing a twisted Stray Devil?\"\n\n\"No not really, my power only really hinders me when I am around hundreds of people. When I am in battle at most I have been surrounded by around maybe 20 people so far so it hasn't been an issue. Twisted people mostly only affect me when I can't put up a defence to them in time, or they catch me by surprise. If I prepare myself before going into battle, I can handle the stress well enough.\" Naruto explained with a sigh at the fact everyone seemed to think he would be overwhelmed by emotion in battle. It was the opposite, he gained such focus in battle that he could sort of dull his ability enough to not be as negativally affected... to s certain degree.\n\nFan letter to Grayfia the 'She whom you probably should not mess with'  \n\"Did you ever get caught by any of Naruto's pranks?\"\n\n\"Once... just once, and Naruto got his punishment for it. He won't be pranking me again anytime soon.\" Grayfia pointed out with a small, but wicked, smile at how she had taught Naruto to take her name from the pranking list... with a very good spanking.\n\n\n\t11. Chapter 11 The Giant Contract\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'This collar... I like it.' Naruto thought as he watched the surrounding of the night time city rush by as he sat on the back of a bike that was currently being ran by Issei. It had only been a week since Issei had been made one of the three Pawns on Rias' peerage. In those three days he had been going through the a rough time adjusting to the changes in his life. Actually, he adjusted to the fact he was a devil pretty quickly, but what took him awhile was to find a form of motivation to rise through the ranks.\n\n\"So if I do good on gathering Contracts I can level up and become a Harem King in the future right?\" Issei asked the boy ojn the back of his bike with excitement in his voice. Yes, this was the reason that Issei wanted to become a High Class devil, so that he could have his own harem of beautiful babes. The guy had shouted out his reason, not even attempting to hide it from the others, something that Naruto could respect. Issei may be a pervert, but he was an open pervert with lots of determination. That was why Naruto was letting Issei come with him to see how a proper contract was suppose to go, but because Issei had an extremelhy low amount of magical power he was unable to use the teleportation circle under his own power. Now, Naruto could let him ride along with him when he used the circle, but Issei needed to work out anyway.\n\n\"Well, harems among High Class devils aren't very uncommon these days. Of course, most harems are formed with people that they collect in their peerage, or for political reasons. If you want a harem, you are going to have to get your own peerage... right now though you are just Rias' Low Class Pawn. She explained Evil Pieces to you right?\" Naruto asked without looking at Issei, but with how their backs were touching he was able to feel the responce by both emotions and the physical vibrations going through Issei. Rias had clearly explained to Issei was his role in the peerage was, and suffice to say Issei was suffering some self-esteem issues when he heard that he was the lowest guy on the totem pole.\n\n\"Yeah, but I don't want to be a sucky Pawn. For that matter, how can you stand being a Queen? That title should go to a girl right?\" Issei questioned something that many people had bothered Naruto about before. If Issei was worried about how he was a Pawn, then being given a female title must be killing Naruto on the inside.\n\n\"Doesn't really bother me, my King is a girl. Gender doesn't matter to the Evil Piece system, nor should it. I call myself Rias' Queen with pride, and you should be proud of being her Pawn nya. They may not sound like a very important position, but there are some pretty strong Pawns out there.\" Naruto said with a nudge to Issei's back, the boy felt himself grow happy at somebody not putting him down in the last few days. He felt conflicted that the only people not treating him with some kind of distrust or disdain were the other men of the peerage, and Rias herself, but he was actually pretty fond of Naruto. Then again, Naruto was nice to everyone in the peerage... and Issei had to admit he was sort of jealous of all the attention that the smaller boy got from the ladies.\n\n\"Thanks... hey, totally random question... but how do you get girls to fawn over you so much?\" Issei asked as he turned down on ally on his bike, while Naruto stayed on the bike without even looking like he was going to fall off despite the fact he was sitting with his legs crossed. It was nice to have a personal ride for going on a job when he didn't want to teleport.\n\n\"I'm cute, and I don't hesitate to play off that fact. I admit that I really like getting pampered by the ladies, and because I am small they don't think twice of letting me into their laps. Boobs make very nice places to rest your head, very soft, very jiggly, warm, and very comfy.\" Naruto explained his own preferences when it came to girls. He would not confirm nor deny the fact that he was a pervert, which was part of the reason he was rather fond of Issei. It was nice having somebody that was so open about himself around.\n\n\"I both respect you, hate you, and look up to you.\" Issei said with pride in his own voice at being in the presence of a possible harem king. Yep, if there was anyone in Rias' peerage that Issei would call his best friend, that person would have to be Naruto.\n\n\"Technically, you have to look down to see me nya.\" Naruto said with a small smile gracing his face as he joked about his own short stature. Issei laughed nervously as well, not because he was afraid of how Naruto would react, but because he had never met a person that would so quickly make fun of their own height like that. He would think that Naruto's height would be something that bothered him, but he hadn't been sure how to ask about it. Naruto noticed this, and smirked lightly at how nervous Issei was. \"Don't worry about it Issei, my height doesn't bother me. The race I come from are short and lean people, we just don't get very big. As long as you aren't trying to be mean when you comment on my height then a few jokes are okay.\" Naruto explained with a small smirk on his face, it honestly did bother him at one point that he was tied with Koneko as the shortest person in the peerage.\n\n\"Phew, that is a relief. You know, I didn't really believe Rias at first when she said YOU were the Queen of her peerage. I was expecting that Akeno person to be the Queen, she just seemed to have the... presence about her.\" Issei commented lightly, knowing that he would bother Naruto very much with it made it easier for him to talk to Naruto about it. He had really thought Akeno was the Queen until Rias had him that it was Naruto that took that position.\n\n\"Yeah, she is a the oldest in the group. You just kind of expect her to be the Queen, nobody ever expects the youngest to be the Queen. You can't judge a book by it's cover, Akeno may be sweet on the outside, but she is a sadist on the inside... she was a bit of a bully when she was younger nya.\" Naruto stated, and as he said that the entire bike titled and shook from Issei's shock.\n\n\"No way!? She seems so nice!\" Issei shouted from the sheer thought that the sweet Akeno that had offered him tea used to be a bully.\n\n\"I kid you not, she used to pull down my pants whenever she got the chance. Then I would prank her in return, and she would dress me up like a girl in my sleep. She would tease Rias, but I was her main target because of my size. It didn't really bother me, and I had fun pranking her so she sort of grew bored with being a bully.\" Naruto went on as he delved deeper into the story fondly, it might seem horrible to say, but he had to admit that he missed the old Akeno. Yeah, her sadistic mode was creepy, but when she was just a small bully and teased people she was sort of fun. Don't get him wrong, he could do without waking up wearing panties, but it wasn't like it hurt anyone.\n\n\"That is... shocking. I guess you really can't judge a book by it's cover... what did you think of me when you first saw me?\" Issei questioned out of curiousity, and Naruto had to think about it for a moment.\n\n\"I thought... you were a complete pervert that was obsessed with breasts nya.\" Naruto said with a grin hidden on his face, while Issei prepared to defend his love of boobs. He didn't get the chance because Naruto continued what he was going to say before he could explain his passion for the boobs. \"Though, I don't think that is all there is to you. I can tell that you are a good person Issei, and under all the pervy things you think and do you are somebody that is loyal and determined. I can say with confidence that you are somebody that I want as my friend, and when you are strong enough a person that I can trust to watch my back.\" Naruto said with confidence in his tone, and if he could see Issei's face he would notice that the boy's eyes were watering thanks to the kindest words anyone had ever spoken to him before. His opinion of the short Queen completely changed at that moment, and he himself would be proud to call Naruto his friend.\n\n'Nobody has ever said anything that nice to me before... you are a really good person Naruto. I can see why Buchou made you her Queen.' Issei thought, before he felt Naruto use the back ofd his hea to nudge him in the back.\n\n\"So, since we are sharing what we thought about each other, what did you first think about me?\" Naruto asked with a sly grin, knowing that Issei had not thought much of him when he gulped.\n\n\"I thought you were a lucky bastard for getting al the girls to fawn over you, and that you didn't look like much in a fight.\" Issei finally admit to what he originally thought of Naruto, while the spiky white haired boy laughed at the nervous brown haired boy.\n\n\"Yeah, tons of people underestimate me at first. You know what though, screw being tall. I am short enough that I can look at boobs and not get in trouble for it. When people are walking they bump into me, and I get boobs in my face frequently.\" Naruto said with a few pokes to Issei's back in a form of light taunting, knowing that the brown haired biy would get jealous of him. The responce was just what he expected when Issei started to feel like crying at th news that the younger, smaller boy was getting more boob than he was.\n\n\"Besides the point, what do you normally do on jobs?\" Issei asked a serious question, while Naruto had to think about it for a moment.\n\n\"It depends, we do what they want and they sign the contract for us. This helps increase our standing in the Underworld, but the more powerful the devil the more powerful the desire needs to be to summon us. I allow myself to be summoned by most people, while Rias saved her summons for people with powerful desires. This is a regular client for me, and the job is rather easy.\" Naruto described as they stopped in front of a small house, the house was only one story and it was fenced off from the houses nearby. Naruto hopped off the bike, while Issei leaned the bike up against the wall. The two of them started to walk towards the door, the gate being open at the time, and Issei sweat dropped when he saw some fat little gnomes running around the yard. No seriously, there were tiny little people runnin around the yard cleaning it late at night.\n\nThe door suddenly burst open before they could knock on it, and a very large person was seen. Issei gulped when he saw th easily 6 foot 10 inches tall person answer the door, and his huge bulging muscles were barely kept inside his stretched thin shirt. His skin was tanned by a lot of exposure tot he sun, and his hair was the brightest of blonds. He wore square rimmed glasses on his face, and in his hand he had a large weight that he was using to curl. Issei gulped when he saw that on each side of the weight were numbers adding up to a total of 800 pounds. His hair was wet from sweat, and slicked back to keep it out of his face.\n\n\"Ah, Naruto-kun... and this is the newbie that Rais-san told me would be coming with you. Come on in, I have some drinks prepared already.\" The large man said kindly as he moved to allow them to pass by him, and if Issei wasn't surprised before he really was now when he walked into the home with Naruto and saw plenty of pictures on the walls of the man with a small family. He followed Naruto into the living room, and sure enough there was the man's family sitting in the living room.\n\nThe man's wife was just as tall as her husband, somethng that shocked Issei when he noticed that her entire body was toned to perfection, yet there wasn't a single bulging muscle on her body like her husband. Her skin was tanner than her husband's skin, and her hair was a dark blue color with a few stipes of pink, this showing that she actually died her hair these colors. She was wearing a tank top, and a pair of men's boxers over her shapily hips. Issei's eyes went straight to her breasts, and he noticed that they were each larger than Akeno's breasts, who now had the second largest breasts he had seen. This woman had on sunglasses that hide her eyes from view, and while her husband was pumping iron she was eating a small slice of strawberry cake from a decorative plate.\n\n\"Issei, these two are my most regular clients. The man is Dekkai Futoppara, his wife is Takenaga Futoppara, and they have a daughter named Kyokan Futoppara.\" Naruto explained the family, and Issei wanted to chuckle when his head translated their names into english from what he had learned of the language. What Naruto had just told him was that the man was named Large Big, his wife was Tall Big, and their daughter was Giant Big. They were a family of tall and toned people.\n\n\"Sorry if our size scares you, we are descended from a families of big people. We are very kind people when you get to know us. Anyway, it is a pleasure to meet you Hyoudou-kun, Rias-san spoke to me over the phone and told me you would be watching Naruto as he did his work. I hope this will be a very educational experience for you, Naruto is very good at what he does.\" Dekkai explained his size, while Naruto hummed in agreement. It had taken him awhile to get used to the amazing size difference of this family when comparing them to normal people, but it was a pretty neat story behind them.\n\n\"Kaa-san! Tou-san! Is that Naruto-kun in there with you!?\" A feminine voice shouted out from the next room over, and seconds later a large teenage girl came from around the corner with a magazine in her hands. Issei almost went into pervert mood at seeing the tall beauty that turned around the corner, like her parents this girl was tall. When comparing her to himself he would say that she was maybe around 6 feet 8 inches tall, something that was amazing for a female in his opinion. Her hair went down to her shoulders, and was a complete mess that hadn't seen a comb in awhile. Her hair covered her left eye completely, and her right eye showed that she had a very bright red eye. She was tanned like her parents, and the color of her hair was the same blond as her father.\n\nLike her mother, she had a slim yet toned body when comparing to her size. If you had to guess where she came from Issei would think this girl came from a tropical area because of her hair and tan, and with her height he would guess she was some sort of Amazon. Her breasts were just as large as her mother's, making her somebody that had to have her bras custom made and ordered to her house. Her hips were a bit more narrow than her mothers, but that was because she was still young.\n\n\"Hey Kyokan, I am here again. Nice to see you NYA!\" Naruto shouted out the last part in a moment of surprise when she picked him up and sat right down on the couch next to her mother and started to stroke his head.\n\n\"Nice to see you as well Naruto-kun, have you become a High Class Devil yet?\" Kyokan asked right away, and she felt Naruto shake his head. His words were muffled by her chest, so letting him go she noticed the knew person in the room. She waved nervously at Issei, while he was dumbfounded at seeing this group of people.\n\n\"Issei, this is Kyokan. She is planning to become part of my peerage when I become a High Class Devil, she was my first client when I came to Kuoh Academy.\" Naruto explained to the dumbfounded boy, who was only able to nod his head while still trying to process everything he had just seen.\n\n\"Okay then, you know what to do Naruto-kun.\" Dekkai said as he brought out a notebook and started to write something down. Naruto hopped away from Kyokan before he took a pose with his fist against his chin and his other hand resting across his chest. Dekkai nodded and started to draw something down that Issei couldn't see. As if sensing his concern Takenaga waved her hand to Issei to get his attention.\n\n\"My husband is a proffesional fashion desigher, and he mostly sticks to making clothes for smaller people. He likes to summon Naruto-kun at least once a month and have him pose in ways that will inspire him to make new clothes. Naruto-kun is a very handsome young man, and we like to use his looks to help his work along.\" Takenaga explained to the shocked boy. This huge bulking man that was using one hand to lift a 800 pound weight was a fashion designer for his work?! That was something he was NOT expecting, not even in the slightest. The guy was so ripped that Issei had thought he was a pro wrestler or a bodybuilder. Not a person that designed clothes for a living.\n\nIssei must have looked like a fool by opening and closing his mouth in shock, because as he stared at the huge man he coudln't see this man as anything other than a musclehead.\n\n\"She speaks the truth Issei, Dekkai looks like this because they come from a long line of huge people. He does work out, but him working out isn't why his muscles are so big nya.\" Naruto told Issei while standing completely still, and the boy was looking at the wife of the huge man again. He was still in something like shock on how a woman can be this tall, and if he wasn't sure it was impossible he would say this was literally a family of giants. He was surprised when he felt something cold touch his face, and he saw Takenaga handing him a glass of cold lemonade while Kyokan had her eye solely on Naruto at this point while licking her lips. Naruto shivered slightly at the predatory gaze directed at him, knowing where it was coming from.\n\n\"Right, our family has roots from ancient Greece. My wife and daughter are descended from the creatures known as cyclops, while I am descended from a tribe of small giants that travelled around the Greek ages, as time grew on our people started to grow smaller until they were able to breed with humans. Our blood is very diluted, but we are mostly human.\" Dekkai stated as his wife and daughter showed that fact that they didn't have a second eye by taking off their sunglasses and moving her hair out of her face. It wasn't an empty eye socket either, it was more like they didn't even have a hole for an eye to go in anyway. It was just flat there, like there had never been an eye to begin with.\n\n\"Don't freak out dude, we don't eat people. Mostly human after all.\" Kyokan explained when she saw Issei tense up, while Naruto chuckled lightly. He knew that it was a good idea to take Issei along on this contract.\n\nIssei was a pretty funny guy with how he would react to every little thing.\n\nNaruto would enjoy pranking Issei.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t12. Chapter 12 Escape\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you could have taken me through the magic circle the entire time, and that I gave you a ride on my bike for nothing?\" Issei said with a twitching eyebrow after Naruto teleported them back to the clubroom through the magic circle, a slip of paper and a bag of clothes in his hands. Issei was completely frustrated at the fact that Naruto had made him do all the work at getting there, while Naruto got to do the easy part and just do poses so that the giant man was able to draw him and get insperation for new clothes.\n\n\"Hey, you NEED the work out. If you ever want a girl to work with your chubbie, then you might want to lose some chub.\" Naruto stated as he poked Issei in the gut to show that he did have some fat on him. Issei covered his gut with a blush at the fact that naruto was telling him to lose weight... or gain muscle, it was rather hard to get the underlining message that Naruto was going for. The fact they were surounded by most of the Occult Research Club besides the two girls on their own missions to increase their standings made this entire thing that much funnier from Naruto's point of view. Issei couldn't even get mad at Naruto because the white haired teen was just telling him of a way to increase his chances with the ladies.\n\n\"I take it you completed your mission?\" Rias asked with a small glint in her eye when she saw the bag that was in his hands, and the slip of contract paper resting on top of it. Naruto walked over to her desk and placed the bag on top of it, before handing her the piece of paper that was proof that he had completed his contract. She looked over it idly, already knowing that Naruto would have a perfect success. He and Gasper were her best contract makers after all, and while Gasper had more contracts, Naruto had a lot of contracts that were filled with a lot of desire in them. He also never failed a contract to this date, showing that he was valuable.\n\nRias' eyes went to the bag on her desk before a sly grin overcame her features at the extra reward that the large family always gave Naruto for completing the jobs he had with them. This was something that Rias had been bribed with to keep their heritage secret from other devils that would no doubt come after them to try and get them into peerage members. As it was, once Rias had tried to convince Kyokan to become a member of her peerage, but the girl had told her she was saving herself to become Naruto's when he ranked up again. Anyway, in this entire city the only people that were aware of their secret heritage was Naruto, Rias, and now Issei. Not even the rest of her peerage knew about this at the moment.\n\nAnyway, as thanks for keeping the Futoppara heritage secret the family of large people thanked the Gremory Group by having Naruto deliver an extra reward in the form of cute underwear that was sized to actually fit them.\n\n\"These are some of Kyokan's older bras that stopped fitting her awhile ago, but she figured that you would like them. She outgrew them awhile ago.\" Naruto explained as he pulled a bra out of the bag and showed it to Rias, while the red haired girl nodded in thanks. If the daughter of a fashion designer thought she would like them, then she most likely would. Not to mention the fact that all of Kyokan's old clothes were made of an extemely soft silk, but was lined with a small amount of extremely thin metalic fiber that helped keep the clothes durable. With how strong the family was, if they didn't line their clothes like this they would rip through them on accident.\n\nRias sweat dropped when she held the bra up to her chest and saw that it was just the right size for Rias to wear. That would mean that since the last time she had seen Kyokan the girl had surpassed her breast size, and if what Naruto said was true then she had also surpassed Akeno's breas size.\n\n\"Oh holy goddess of titties, those are some big melon hammacks! I would love to stick my face in them to see if they fit!\" Issei shouted without realizing that everyone in the room was looking at him strangely. He didn't even care though when he was able to see how big those bras were, which means that under her shirt Rias had amazing breasts. Naruto slapped his own forehead at Issei's comment, but was chuckling lightly at the way he said that even though everyone was listening.\n\n\"Shut it perv pants.\" Koneko said with annoyance in her mostly neutral tone, while giving Issei a very disgusted look for a moment. Issei stopped talking when he saw the deadly look she was sending him, or at least it was deadly in his opinion. To him that reminded him of a girl that had woken up on the wrong side of the bed, and was looking for somebody to take her problems out on in. Naruto was shaking his head in amusement as Akeno went next to Rias and started to look through the bag of underwear for something she might like as well, with her and Rias being about the same size they were able to wear the same bra size, but it was a bit tight on Akeno. Then again, she liked her bras a bit too tight.\n\n\"Speaking of which, now Issei, do you think you will be able to get a contract on your own now that you have seen how one was done?\" Rias questioned her newest Pawn when her other Pawns entered the room and sat on the couch away from Issei. She handed Issei a contract that had been originally for Koneko, but if she went she would miss out on another contract she would rather do. Naruto looked at the request, and he immediently felt sorry for Issei when he saw the name that was scheduled for visiting. This was a person that even Naruto didn't like to visit, because he was just so... fabulous?\n\n'Oh poor Issei, if he accepts this request he will be forced to deal with Mil-tan.' Naruto thought with a light shiver, knowing that Mil-tan would scar Issei for life. Mil-tan was a very dark skinned body builder with long blond hair, and my body builder Naruto meant that Mil-tan was a huge dude. That wasn't the disturbing part though, Dekkai was even more muscular than Mil-tan and a lot taller as well. What was disturbing about Mil-tan was the fact that this bulky male acted and dressed in girl's clothes, magical girl's clothes.\n\n\"Anything to get closer to my dream of being a Harem King!\" Issei bragged with determination, while Naruto felt like warning the foolish brown haired boy that he should think about things before he agreed to them.\n\n\"How... nice, but are you sure you don't want anyone to go with you?\" Rias tried to confirm, also knowing that Issei wouldn't like going to this client. Naruto walked next to Akeno and nudged her side with a knowing look, whil she looked at him for a moment when she didn't immediently pick up his non-verbal request. She did understand a few moments later Naruto pinched her side hard enough to get the message across. Stepping forward, Akeno stepped in front of Rias with a smile on her face.\n\n\"Actually Buchou, I think that it would be better to start Issei-kun's training immediently. With the Fallen Angels around, who knows what kind of bad things could happen to him if he is alone. I think he should hold of on contracts until he is able to use the Summoning Circle to get to locations.\" Akeno suggested a different course of action, while Naruto nodded in approval behind her. If the Fallen Angels became aware that Issei was alive even after having his Sacred Gear extracted, things would just get more troublesome for their group. Rias seemed to consider the idea for a moment, before she looked at Issei with a stern gaze.\n\n\"Change of plans, Issei, you are to go with Akeno and see if we can get you to raise your reserves before letting you go and fufill contracts. Naruto, if it isn't too much trouble can you...?\" Rias trailed of while holding the piece of paper up, only to find out that Naruto was no longer even in the room. The second his name had been stated, he ran like a bat out of hell to avoid having to go to Mil-tan, something that would be perfectly understandable if you know who Mil-tan was. Rias sighed before she looked towards Yuuto, only to see he had taken a page out of Naruto's book and jumped out of the open window before he could get called on. Rias sighed in frustration before looking at Koneko. The white haired girl noticed this look and her eyes widened before she started to shake her head.\n\n\"Mil-tan can suck it, I am not doing it either.\" Koneko stated as she ran towards the window and jumped out of it, and while she may not be nearly as fast as Yuuto and Naruto, she was running like a bat out of hell to get out of the room. Rias' eye twitched and she looked towards to Gasper, and his eyes wideneed in absolute horror. Seconds later Gasper exploded into a group of black bats and LITERALLY flew away like a bat out of hell, many bats out of hell. There was no way that anyone that had done the Mil-tan job would willingly go back to doing it.\n\n\"What a peerage I have, Katase, I want you to take this job.\" Rias ordered as she gave the contract to Katase, who was rather nervous to be doing it. She didn't have much of a choice though when she was forcefully pushed through the summoning circle and to the job location by Rias. The red haired King sighed into her hand at how nobody seemed to want to go do a job with this client, of course she hadn't ever worked with Mil-tan before so she didn;t know the true horrors of spending an extreme amount of time with the manly man that dressed like a girly girl.\n\n\"That was totally mean.\" Murayama stated when she noticed that the only people still in the room was her and Rias, and the top dog of the group rubbed her head in annoyance. Rias was just annoyed that everyone but Katase had been able to find a way to skip out on this job.\n\n\"She needs to experience with the strange.\" Rias reasoned rather quickly, before she went back to the book she had been reading before Issei and Naruto had come back from Naruto's contract. While she was reading she went over the list of people that she should try and get into her peerage before the Rating Game she had to have with Riser. This was another reason why Naruto was her favorite member of her peerage.\n\nOriginally she had been set to marry Riser, but it was Naruto that brought up the point that if Rias was capable of defeating Riser in a Rating Game then she would be more than mature enough to pick out her own husband when she chose to. Riser had NOT been a fan of the fact that both sets of parents had agreed with that, nor the fact that Naruto pointed out that if Rias could defeat Riser and his peerage that the Phenex boy wasn't even worthy of being with her in the first place. After all, if Riser married Rias it was possible that he would become the head of the Gremory, and the Gremory did not need a heir that was weaker than the current heir to the position of Head of the Gremory.\n\nRight now though, Riser had a complete peerage, which meant that they would have the numbers advantage of at least seven people that this moment. Rias had little doubt that her peerage each had quality on their side, but sometimes pure numbers were what would decide the match. She wanted to reduce that advantage as much as possible before the Rating Game, so she had been having Naruto scout for good choices in peerage members because of this fact.\n\nOf course, there were some people that she wanted that she could have. She wanted to make Kyokan a member of her peerage, not only for the fact that she was a human with both Giant and Cyclops blood in her, but also because of the fact that she had a rather usefull skill about her that would become a great asset to whoever allied with her. Sadly, she wouldn't willingly become a member any peerage besides Naruto's when the time came. The tall beauty had stated clearly that she would only become a member of Naruto's peerage, which meant that Rias wouldn't have access to her in Rating Games. Riser would be put at a major disadvantage if they were able to get somebody that was of cyclops of giant descent into her peerage, mainly because of the fact that the cyclops had an amazingly high flame/lightning resistance and a naturally high defence and strength. The fact that she was mostly human kind of lowered this a bit, but because of her human part she was smarter than the old cyclops, as well as being able to use her special skills that she could gain from becoming a devil.\n\nShe wanted to get another Sacred Gear holder in her peerage, because right now she only had two real Sacred Gear users that she could confirm. She suspected Naruyto had a Sacred Gear, but it couldn't be confirmed at this moment. If she could get one more Sacred Gear into her peerage then she would be happy with her chances of victory, which was why she really wanted to find people quickly.\n\nRight now she had only been made aware of two unknown Sacred Gear users left in the city, there may be more, but she could only name two of them. The first was the user of the Sacred Gear that was known as Aphrodite's Magic Girdle, a Sacred Gear that made any person that wore it gain the ability make almost any man with weak willpower fall in love with. This Sacred gear would be useless against Riser and his all female peerage, even more so since the person that had this Sacred Gear was a BOY.\n\nThe second Sacred Gear was already out of her reach though because of the fact that the person the held it refused to have anything to do with devils. Sona had already tried to recruit this person and failed, and they still didn't know what type of Sacred Gear it was anyway. Both of these people were rather recent discoveries, and never of them were really usefull as they were. The fact that never had been attacked by Fallen Angels for their Gears shows that they weren't really threats.\n\n\"Earth to Buchou, are you okay?\" Murayama asked out of concern for the spaced out woman, and she blinked a few times before smiling at the concern. Even if she didn't have anymore Sacred Gear users at this time, she was still pretty sure that with proper planning that she could defeat Riser. Right now she needed to focus on the people she already had in her peerage, she needed to train her three Pawns so that they could at least defeat some of Riser's Pawns. They had no chance against anything higher, but her higher pieces didn't need to waste time and energy on defeating Pawns.\n\n\"Just fine, just lost in thought. How is your training with Yuuto and Koneko going?\" Rias asked conversationally, and Murayama groaned at the memory of how tough those two could be when teaching. She always went home with major bruises because of their training, but at least she was doing better than Katase. Her shiver was all it took for Rias to understand how her training was going, and she nodded in approval. Normally she liked to be the one to personally train her peerage, but right now she was more concerned with other matters.\n\n1 Bishop, 1 Knight, and 5 Pawns.\n\nThese were what Rias had left to get herself ready for the Rating Game to come.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t13. Chapter 13 The Twilight\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Otouto, I'm hungry... huh?\" Koneko said first thing in the morning when she noticed that there was something opn the fridge. She looked at it for a moment and noticed that it was a note in Naruto's handwriting. Taking the note down, she started to look it over before frowning. Opening the fridge she pulled out a freshly made and wrapped plate of sushi, knowing that this was something her brother left her for breakfast today. She placed it on the counter with a frown on her face, normally she really enjoyed her brother's cooking, but after reading the note she was more curious as to why he wasn't here making it for her in person. She unwrapped the dish and started to snack on the sushi that was left for her, and her eyes went over to the door.\n\nAs she ate she tried to think of what she wanted to do today, Devils couldn't collect contracts during the day so that wasn't even an option. It was apart of the treaty between the factions, the devils got the night, the angels got the day, and the fallen angels could do both for some reason. Today was a day without school, and she didn't feel like going to the clubroom right now. Rias was out on some kind of business anyway so there wasn't a real reason to try and bother her right now.\n\nShe could visit that new Cafe that had opened up near the Arcade, but she wasn't sure if she wanted to be stared at by everyone. She was a rather private person, and didn't like to be the focus of a stranger's attention. In that aspect she was the opposite of her siblings, that loved being the center of attention. Kuroka made sure everyone knew that she was in the room, and Naruto loved being pampered and given attention. She just prefered to sit quietly and enjoy her snacks, maybe tease Gasper a little, but other than that she didn't really have many hobbies besides listening to her favorite kinds of music.\n\nShe sighed to herself and went over to the couch and layed down on it, and once she was comfy she reached out and touched the radio on the coffie table and switched it on. Sighing, she allowed her home to be filled with the sounds of Rap music. People were surprised by the fact that she liked rap music, but in her opinion rap was pretty cool. It didn't hurt that Kuroka disliked rap music, that had nothing to do with her love of rap at all... maybe a little, but she liked the fact that Naruto would listen to it with her even though he wasn't the biggest fan of rap. He confided in her that whenever he listens to rap he gets the strange mental image of a tall black guy with sun glasses spewing out horrible rap lyrics while doing strange dances. She had NO idea what that was about, and frankly she didn't want to know.\n\nShe couldn't do this all day though, that would be far too boring. She looked at the note that Naruto had left for her again with a frown.\n\n_ Dear Onee-chan,_  \n_Left to go work out with Issei and Yuuto, I made breakfast for you and left it in the fridge. After that I am going to walk around the city and scout foir Fallen Angels and Sacred Gear holders. I might not be home until late, so don't get worried._\n\n_Love, Naruto._\n\n'Buchou works him to hard, he hardly has had any free time to just hang out with me since we have arrived at Kuoh Academy.' Koneko mentally complained even though nobody would know about it. She missed the time she got to spend with Naruto when he was in the Underworld with her and the rest, but now he had to juggle between homework, school, clients, training, and scouting for Rias. He barely got time to spend with just her, which she would admit was leaving her a little annoyd with Rias. She had long since gotten over being given to Rias as pets, she was only annoyed with Kuroka over that fact, but she didn't like the fact that she didn't get to spend time with the one sibling that she would readily admit that she liked spending time with.\n\nKoneko sneezed and rolled off of the couch and onto the floor, before she groaned slightly when she saw the amount of dust that was under the couch. Standing up, she made her way to go get the vacuum, before she changed her mind and jumped right back on the couch. She didn't want to spend her time cleaning today, even if the couch was a little dusty she could deal with it. She would clean it up another day, or have Naruto clean it. She started to scratch her stomach and yawn, before she got up and sighed out of annoyance.\n\nMaybe she would go to that Cafe after all.\n\n**-With Naruto-**\n\n\"Come on Issei, you can do it. You just need to do five more and your done!\" Naruto said while wearing a orange V-neck T-shirt and a pair of swimming trunks that was mainly black but with the image of a white cat head on the right leg. This was his usual work out outfit, and right now he and Yuuto were standing nearby as Issei wearing rather plain clothes was lifting a bar off his chest. Today Naruto had decided that he would drag Issei and Yuuto out on some male bonding, and start the day off with working out.\n\n\"I feel... like my arms... are burning!\" Issei shouted in a tired annoyance as he lifted the weight again, and he let out a gasp when he dropped it. The weight was about to collide with his chest, before Yuuto caught it with his hands and pulled it back up onto the pegs so that Issei could take a break. Yuuto offered Issei a kind smile, while Issei nearly gagged at how much of a 'prince' type that Yuuto looked like.\n\n\"It isn't that bad when you get used to it Issei, Naruto started me off on about this much as well. Now I can safely say that I can lift 460 pounts without to much trouble. You should try and get used to this though, if you want to get strong you need to train.\" Yuuto offered his sound advice, remembering when Naruto had started him off with 140 pounts as well. Since Yuuto wasn't a Rook or Queen he didn't have amazing strength and defence naturally. This was Naruto's solution to this, and by increasing the weight he could get Yuuto's base strength up. You couldn't tell normally, but under Yuuto's clothes he was pretty well muscled thanks to the training. He thanked Naruto for pushing him to grow stronger, and not just trying to increase his speed and sword skills.\n\n\"This is... torture.\" Issei moaned out in agony, his muscles screaming at him for the pain to stop. That was before Naruto slapped him on the stomach lightly, for him at least, and then got him to jump up in stinging pain. He gave Naruto a betrayed look, before he noticed the smile on Naruto's face.\n\n\"You know Issei, if you push yourself to far Rias will have to heal your muscles. She does it for me and Yuuto when we overdo our training as well... you know that she heals by hugging a person while naked right?\" Naruto played on Issei's love of breasts, and by the perverse blush and smile on his face Naruto could tell that he had gotten Issei more than motivated for the workout to come. Naruto gave Issei a pat of the back and started to push him towards the treadmill. Turning it on, Naruto watched as Issei began to run at full force right away with the desire to get healed by Rias plain on his face. Naruto almost busted a gut laughing at the fact that Issei thought that seeiung Rias naked was something special.\n\nRias was not a person that cared if her peerage saw her naked, and she prefered to sleep naked. Heck, they even had a shower in their clubroom that only had a curtain to keep those showering from being seen completely nude. If Issei wanted to see Rias naked, it wouldn't be a hard thing to do, but it was great motivation for an open pervert like him to work harder.\n\n\"Hey Naruto, how much do you want this time?\" Yuuto asked while holding onto a large weight taht had the number 250 carved onto the side of it. Naruto didn't even need to think about it before he himself started to grab some of the weights and load them up onto the bar. Naruto stopped when he mentally added the weight to equal a full 2,000 pounds. This wasn't anywhere near his limit, so using one hand to lift up the weight he started to use the top of his hand to balance the weight on it's side. There wasn't enough room on the weight to give him a good workout anyway, so he used this to work on his balance and ability to concentrate on something while doing other things.\n\nThey were currently inside the schools weight and training room, even though today wasn't a school day. It helped that they were able to get over the wall rather easily, so instead of paying for gym memberships they would simply sneak in and use these.\n\n\"If you keep running at full speed you will tire yourself out too quickly, pace yourself Issei.\" Naruto suggested when he noticed that Issei was working out the wrong way for his body type. Naruto held his hand out and balanced the weight while he began to run on a different treadmill at full speed for the treadmill, this wasn't much of a workout for any Queen. The most challenging part was keeping the weight balanced on his hand, which should help him build up his ability to multitask.\n\n\"I have to see those Oppai, so I have to push myself!\" Issei shouted without slowing down at all, Naruto raised an eyebrow before shrugging. If Issei wanted to do it the hard way, then he could do it the hard way. The boy followed the path of the breasts with a true heart, and while respectable for other men, wasn't going to prove very good for him if he pushed himself like this. Naruto heard the sound of Yuuto grunting in pain for a few moments when he dropped a weight on his foot, but it wasn't anything too serious for him to get concerned about. Naruto shook his head before he looked at the time they had been here, seeing that they had been here for a few hours Naruto stopped what he was doing and placed the weight on the ground. Next time he would complete his training, but he would need to trust Yuuto to keep an eye on Issei while he went out scouting.\n\n\"Yuuto, you take care of Issei. I am going out scouting.\" Naruto said without waiting for Yuuto's responce as he ran out of the room. He sighed before blinking when a chill went down his spine, he blinked and frowned. For some reason he felt as if something wasn't right, but he couldn't place his finger on it. Shaking his head he continued to run out of the school, easily getting out in seconds with his speed. As he jumped over the gate to the school he used magict o change his clothes into his school uniform without the jacket. He landed on the ground in a crouched position, before he dusted himself off.\n\nNaruto started to run through the city, following only his gut as he turned down a corner. He didn't know what was guiding him, but he was following the chill that went down his back that seemed to get stronger. This could only mean that their were Exorcists in the city for some reason, because he had no real trouble going near crosses unless he physically touched them with his skin.\n\nNaruto frowned when he remembered that weird feeling that he had gotten when he wasn't using his new collar to suppress his sensing power. That vile feeling from what he suspected could be a twisted priest that had been kicked out of the church. He turned the corner quickly and went into the park without noticing where he was, and if he was correct about it he could sense the energy of an ACTIVE Sacred Gear somewhere nearby. That would mean somebody that knew about and used their Sacred Gear, but he couldn't feel the energy of any devils, angels, or even fallen angels in the area.\n\nRias would be so annoyed with him for looking for a person that was sending a chill down his spine, but if this person with a Sacred Gear wasn't a Devil, Fallen Angel, or Angel then they were most likely human. That would mean he would need to scout them out anyway, not to mention that if he could feel their energy then the Fallen Angels were no doubt aware of this person. Naruto sat on one of the benches nearby and just let the warmth of the sun bath him in light. He just relaxed and wiated for the approaching Sacred Gear to come to him, he might not be able to feel emotions at the moment, but he still had his natural energy sensing skills.\n\nNaruto smiled lightly at the fact a target was actually walking towards him, making his job at recruiting that much easier. This allowed Naruto the chance to think about how he had felt a kind emotion signature that was unlike any other before he had started to wear his collar. Naruto knew that whoever that emotion signature belonged to was a very nice person, and somehow he could tell that one day he was going to meet the person that he had felt. When the person he was waiting for took awhile to long, Naruto sighed and stood up to go meet them. He blinked when literally at that moment a blur of white and black hit the ground in front of him.\n\n\"Eep!\" The blur squeeked out as the now revealed to be feminine shape rested on the ground, and Naruto could feel the active Sacred Gear coming from this person. He mentally told himself off for allowing his energy sensing skills to grow rusty, and promised himself that he would work on his ability to sense energy as well as emotions in the future. Allowing somebody to get this close without him even realizing was a major mistake on his part, something that he couldn't allow to happen twice. If this had been an assassin coming after his friends then somebody would be getting hurt for his mistake.\n\nNaruto shook his head and looked down at the fallen figure, only to blink when he saw that he was looking at cute white panties over a hopefully cute girl's butt. If this was another Gasper then Naruto would be so annoyed, because this girl's butt and thighs were too cute to belong to a guy. He had no problem with traps, but he would prefer not to have to deal with them when there was a perfectly good girl instead. He was able to tell right away that based on the dress this girl was wearing that she was from more rustic area. After being the model for clothes enough times you pick up a thing or two about quality of clothes and where they originally came from.\n\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow, but the girl as he was finally convinced of turned around and sat on her butt revealed that she was perfectly okay. Naruto was able to finally see a frontal image of her body now, and he had to admit that she was very cute. Her long black dress had long sleeves that covered her to her wrists, and she had a white collar to her dress with a small blue ribbon on it. It was hard to judge her breast size in the baggy dress, but her long blond hair was blown out of her pretty face by ythe wind moments later. Naruto's eyes widened slightly when he saw the most beautiful green eyes, and her western white skin showing she was most likely from England or France given the way she was dressed... Naruto looked down and then looked up when he noticed that her legs were spread so that he could still see her white panties.\n\nNaruto noticed that her hair was not long long, but perfectly straight as it went down her back. Her bangs were cut nicely, with her forehead showing in the middle and the sides of her banges going down to the sides of her eyes. On top of her head was a single strand of hair that stood up and curved backwards to the back of her head.\n\n\"Yeah, I am a bit clumsy.\" The pretty girl stated with an awkward laugh at her own expense, while Naruto nodded and extended his hand to help her stand up. When she grabbed his hand, he pulled her up and was able to notice the silver cross hanging from her neck. He ignored that though when she started to dust herself off, and Naruto noticed with a smile that her breifcase had open and spilled all of it's contents on the ground. Mostly they were clothes, and the most notable thing was the nun's head dress on the ground, showing this girl was a nun.\n\n\"Here, let me get this for you.\" Naruto stated as he got on the ground and began to place her things in her suitcase, and when she wasn't looking he quickly grabbed a random artical of clothes and hide it away. You would never know when you needed to find somebody, and with his nose he could track her by scent alone. With Fallen Angels in the city, and this girl having a Sacred Gear it would be good to have some sort of way to track her without needing to take off his collar.\n\n\"Thank you so much, I am still new to this country and nobody has been very helpful... or maybe they have. I don't really speak Japanese very well.\" The girl stated, while Naruto blinked and wanyted to bang his head against the ground for a moment when he realized what was going on.\n\nDevil, Fallen Angels, and Angels all had the natural ability to understand and convert any language into their native tongue. To Naruto, it had sounded like Asia was speaking in Japanese, and because of the fact his words would automatically translate into her native tongue she was most likely hearing him speak English or something else. This was an ability made so that Devils could form more contracts without needing to learn new languages, Angels learned this to spread the word of God, and Fallen Angels learned it to control and tempt humans. You had to pay close attention if you wanted to notice that somebody was speaking a different language, and by pay attention you had to read their lips and match them with their words.\n\nThis ability did NOT apply to reading and writing, they had to actually study that to understand it.\n\n\"No issues, trust me on that one. I'm Naruto Toujou by the way, and what can I call you?\" Naruto said as he stood back up with her bag in his hand, and with her head dress in his other hand already extended for her to take. She smiled brightly and took her head dress before placing it on her head and fixing it so that it framed her face correctly. He then blinked when he remembered something, the ONLY Church that they had in this town was abandoned. No Nun in her right mind would come to another country for a Church that was abandoned, not unless she had been kicked out of the Church for some reason. Even then, coming to another country when she was kicked out of the Church showed that something was up.\n\nThis Nun, she wasn't a member of the Church anymore for whatever reason, but she seemed so kind, and the moment he had touched her hand he had been able to tell she was such a pure soul. Something that was extremnely rare these days, and frankly he couldn't see anyone this pure being kicked out of the Church unless she had a Sacred Gear that did something the Church didn't approve of... or that bastard was involved somehow. Naruto's eye gained a glint when he thought about the possiblity that this girl was the proof he needed to finally take out that punk.\n\nThe only Sacred Gears that would be considered evil to the church though were the ones that were demonic in nature like Yuuto's Sword Birth or god killers like the Longinus. This girl wasn't putting out anything remotely similar to either of those, which meant she had a different kind of Sacred Gear. Naruto went through the mental list of heretic Sacred Gears that Rias made him memorize, and in a few seconds Naruto was able to figure out something that he showed have noticed sooner.\n\nThe only Sacred Gear that could be considered heretic, but wasn't a battler in nature was something that was used to heal devils. The ONLY Sacred Gear that was able to heal almost anything, including Devils, was known as the Twilight Healing.\n\nTo think all those lessons with Rias and Grayfia on analizing finally started to pay off, and while he was lost in thought he blinked when the girl waved her hand in front of his face a few times.\n\n\"Sorry about that, could you repeat your name? I was lost in thought for a moment.\" Naruto requested, a sheepish tone in his voice at how he had distracted himself.\n\n\"It's okay, I space out sometimes too! My name is Asia Argento, it is very nice to meet you Naruto Toujou.\" The now named Asia greeted with a smile on her face, a bright smile that made even Naruto blush for a brief moment. Naruto smiled for a moment and made upo his mind about something.\n\nHe would protect this pure girl from the Fallen Angels, even if it got him in trouble with Rias.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t14. Chapter 14 Plan\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with your head!?\" Koneko growled into Naruto's ear as she pulled him into the bathroom, her being actually angry at him was a really rare thing. Sometimes she would be irritated, or a little bit miffed at him, but right now she was actually pissed off at him. By pissed, it was refering to the fact that she would beat the hell out of him if she thought she could get away with it. Naruto was taking a risk that she thought was amazingly stupid, something that was putting his life in a high amount of danger.\n\nWhen Naruto had been talking to Asia she had informed him that she had no idea where the Church was, and Narut had decided that he wouldn't let her go to a Fallen Angel base with ntohing to defend her. That would just be a stupid move to allow her to go into the base of Fallen Angels that were after Rare and Unique Sacred Gears like her Twilight Healing. Now, being the good person that he was he decided that he would invite Asia to stay with them as long as she needed to. He had farbicated a fib to her telling her that the Church was underdoing some relativally recent changes that would leave it in a state that would mean it couldn't house anyone at the moment. This lie had led to her accepting the offer to stay with them, and while Naruto knew for a fact he had crossed the line and would get punished, he had promised that he would take care of this girl and keep her out of the Fallen Angels grasp.\n\nHe was Naruto Toujou, and he kept his promises damnit!\n\n\"She has a Sacred Gear, a really rare one. I can't let her go to the Church KNOWING that it will lead to her death nya. She is such a kind girl, and she deserves to have a nice life. I am going to give her that life nya.\" Naruto explained with a stern look at the door, knowing that Asia was sitting in the living room. He had already placed barriers around the entire apartment complex to keep out anything 'holy' so that they could actually get some sleep. Koneko looked like she calmed down as her face returned to her usual neutral expression. She could tell that Naruto had thought this out, and that he would accept the punishment Rias was going to give him for allowing a nun to stay with them.\n\n\"What if she tries to slit our throats when we sleep?\" Koneko questioned Naruto seriously, and in her mind it was a valid argument. Asia was a holy woman at heart, and in Koneko's mind if she found a devil she would try and kill them.\n\n\"She won't do that, she isn't that kind of person nya. I just know it, and you should trust me on this. I might not be the smartest when it comes to some things, but I am a really good judge of people. When I touched her, I was able to see just how pure she was. She is a GREAT person, and even at the risk of angering our King I will say that I think she might be even more pure than Rias.\" Naruto explained with a small smile on his face, and he didn't know why but he really believed that Asia was a great person. Naruto could tell that Koneko finally believed him when he mentioned that he thought that she was better Rias, something that he had never said about anyone before. Naruto was so connected to Rias that if she didn't know better she would have said he actually took the role of her pet.\n\n\"What if you die because of her?\" Koneko asked the final question before she would allow Asia to stay with them. Naruto closed his eyes for a moment, and Koneko's eyes widened when she saw him open his eyes and show that instead of the normal yellow they were bright with a strange emotion for a brief second that seemed to make them a brighter yellow. Then they were filled with an amazing amount of determination.\n\n\"I promised that I would protect her, and Naruto doesn't go back on his word nya.\" Naruto told Koneko with a determined look on his face, and she leaned against the wall for a moment before sighing. It would seem that she couldn't talk Naruto out of protecting this girl, not when he had it in his mind that he would be doing this. If there was one thing that you could count on it was Naruto keeping his word no matter what. She saw Naruto waiting for her responce, and she nodded to him with a smile on her face. She may not like it, but she had to admit that she was proud of Naruto for keeping true to himself. This may be frustrating, but it was apart of who Naruto was. She would go as far as to say that she would be more surprised if he had given up on this issue, and just let the girl to die. Issei was one thing, but Naruto always had a soft spot for girls.\n\n\"I understand, and I won't tell Buchou about this. This will bite you in the ass, but as your Onee-chan I will supoort you no matter how stupid you act. You are my precious Otouto.\" Koneko stated as she stopped leaning against the wall and opened the bathroom door so that she could leave, not knowing that Naruto was frozen in place at her words. Then slowly he started to smile, before he wiped his eyes to stop the tears before they fell down. With a smile he followed after Koneko and went back into the living room, where Asia was waiting with a smile on her face.\n\n'Thank you Onee-chan, you have no clue how much that means to me.' Naruto silently thanked his sister as he sat on the char across from the couch that Asia was sitting on. Koneko was sitting on the last chair in the room, while Asia was sending the ceiling an awkward look, not knowing how to sya what she wanted to say. Suddenly she bowed down in front of them, and her hair hung to the floor from her positioning.\n\n\"Thank you so much for allowing me to stay here! Just let me know if there is anything I can do to help out!\" Asia stated with a higher than normal pitch, before she felt her head get rubbed by a grinning Naruto who was now standing again. She looked uo to see him grinning, before she smiled and sat back down on the couch with a blush on her face.\n\n\"Nonsense Asia, you are welcome to stay here as long as you like. You are my guest, if you need anything YOU should just ask.\" Naruto stated with a smile on his face, before Asia stood up again with a blush on her face and her smile still present.\n\n\"No, I insist that you let me help you out in anyway I can. I can't stay here without doing something in return.\" Asia tried to reason with Naruto, whose smile became a little more strained. While he liked the gesture, right now she was his guest and his pride as a male was telling him not to let her do anything that she didn't have to do.\n\n\"No no no Asia, you were invited here. You should just allow me to take care of you, not the other way around.\" Naruto said with his smile twitching lightly when he saw that Asia was about to say something else. He waited for her to say her piece, but she stopped with her mouth gapping when she realized that she didn't really have an argument. Not only that, but she realized that she was arguing with the person that was housing her.\n\n\"I am so sorry for arguing, I didn't mean to direspect your hospitality!\" Asia apologized for her earlier outbursts, while Naruto gave Koneko a slightly smug look for Asia proving him right when he was telling Koneko about her. If one was to explain Asia, it would be too nice for her own good. Koenko could see this now, and while she stood by the fact this was a dumb idea, she would at least admit that Asia wasn't about to randomly slit their throats in the middle of the night. AFter a few minutes with the girl it was obvious to tell that she was an innocent girl.\n\n\"No problem, and tell you what. If you honestly want to help out you can do that by promising me that you won't hesitate to come to me if you need me.\" Naruto suggested with an honest smile on his face. She nodded quickly with her bright smile in place, before she sat down again and hopefully for the final time as she begun to let her eyes wander around the room. She smiled at the rather clean home that she was in, and she noticed that on the ground there was a few articles on clothes on the ground just laying there. She had already figured out that Naruto and Koneko lived alone, or rather with each other. She wouldn't ask them about it in case that the reason was that their parents were dead.\n\n\"This place is really nice, thank you again for letting me stay Koneko-san, Naruto-san.\" Asia said again, not knowing what to say beyond this point. Naruto chuckled to himself, before he waved his hand in front of his face.\n\n\"I am not one for formalities, just call me Naruto, or even Naruto-kun.\" Naruto stated, honestly not being a person that liked being called san was something that made him a bit different than the rest of the peerage that weren't bothered by it. He would rather be called by no suffix or kun, from certain people he would even accept chan... that was only from certain people though. If others called him by the chan suffix he would be throwing punches pretty quickly, and only two people would call him the childish version of chan by saying tan instead. Asia was happy, while Koneko seemed like she was annoyed by something.\n\n\"I am going to bed.\" Koneko said after a few moments, not wanting to stay in the super sweet aura these two were letting out. She gave her brother a soft kiss on the cheek before she went to her room, leaving the two alone in the room together. Naruto started to tap his fingers against his leg, not really knowing what to say after this point. He was hiding this from Rias, that was for sure, so he should be thinking on how he was going top keep Asia away from both the Fallen Angels and Rias at the same time. The Fallen Angels would be a bit easier, but Rias would be a bit of a problem since she could teleport here without warning. Naruto blinked for a moment, before he shrugged lightly.\n\n\"Your sister is very... cold?\" Asia tried to put that in the nicest way she could, only for Naruto to laugh lightly at how she placed her words together.\n\n\"Trust me, she is cold to almost everyone. Once you get to know her she will start to show you emotions, but she has trust issues with most people. It is hard for her to allow herself to be honest with her emotions, and she tries to deny herself having them at all. I still love her anyway though, awkwardness and all nya.\" Naruto said with a smile on his face, knowing that Koneko could still hear him despite being the the next room. He was tempted to prank his own sister, but decided that he wouldn't involve Asia in a prank against Koneko so soon. The girl seemed too innocent to get involved with a prank, but for some reason as much as he wanted to protect that innocence, he wanted to corrupt her in the ways of the fun loving prankster.\n\n\"Wow, what made her this way... sorry if that was too personal.\" Asia quickly apologized again, while Naruto waved her apology off like it was nothing. To him it wasn't really an issue anyway, Koneko's issues stemmed from their sister.\n\n\"We have an older sister, and when we were younger Koneko-nee looked up to Onee-chan like she was the best person in the world. She placed Onee-chan on such a high place that when Onne-chan messed up once her entire world was broken. Her trust, her faith, and her emotions broke that day when her idol showed that she wasn't perfect nya. Koneko-nee simply couldn't understand why, and because she was young she didn't understand... overtime I guess she just got used to this way of thinking nya.\" Naruto explained without revealing the exact details, but telling enough for Asia to understand. She seemed to nod slightly, showing that she understood. Honestly, the reason that she was so cold was because if she became to warm to people she was afraid that her trust would be broken again. Kuroka wasn't completely to blame for this, and Konekoi secretely knew this, but it was easier to place blame on her than take credit for any of it herself. Kuroka was just an easy target for her anger, and if she got over her anger she was admitting she was in the wrong about blaming Kuroka. People didn't like to admit they were wrong, so they would rather continue keeping things the same rather than admit to making a mistake.\n\n\"I... think I get it, but if that is true why aren't you like her?\" Asia asked a question that many people asked, and Naruto frowned lightly.\n\n\"I don't know... I looked up to Onee-chan even more than Koneko-nee, but I have always just been a happy person. I just looked on the brighter side, she made a mistake, but she did it out of love for us... how can I be mad at a person that risked everything for the one they loved nya? I am just happy to have her in my life... I always wonder what life would have been like if I didn't have a family. The one thing that scares me more than anything else... is being alone nya.\" Naruto explained his reason, or what he belived was his reason. He knew it was wrong of a devil to say this, but Naruto actually thanked God for allowing him to keep his family. He slapped his hands against his cheeks to stop his train of thought, before he smile at Asia. She looked like she was going to start crying for him, and the tears were already gathering at the corners of her eyes.\n\n\"You must thank the Lord every day for your happiness.\" Asia said with a cute quivering lip, and Naruto grinned lightly. Her talking about God was literally giving him a headache, contrary to popular believe, Devils could say the WORD God, but what they couldn't say was the Biblical God's name. Basically, they couldn't pray to him without pain. They couldn't read the bible without a splitting headache, but they could say the word god. After all, there were more kinds of gods out there. God was just the name of the Biblical God, so they couldn't say the word god if they were refering to him.\n\n\"You know, I can also thank him that I met you. I know it may seem sudden, but I really think you and I can be great friends!\" Naruto bragged for a moment, while she seemed honestly shocked for a moment before her lips started to stretch into a toothy smile as well. Naruto figured that as a nun with a Sacred Gear she led a rather lonely life, and because she was kicked out of the chruch she didn't get the chance to make many friends. People with Sacred Gears normally lived pretty sad loves for the most part, that or very happy lives. If you weren't sad, you were happy.\n\n\"So... how old are you?\" Asia asked the question that many people asked, and Naruto wasn't borthered by it.\n\n\"I'm 15, but I come from a small family. How about you?\" Naruto questioned in return, only for her to puff up her cheeks. Naruto twitched lightly at the old saying don't ask a girl her age playing in this situation.\n\n\"I recently turned 16, but it is rude to ask a lady her age Naruto...kun.\" Asia tried out his name with the kun suffix for the first time, and Naruto nodded in approval. He was a little happy that she was getting used to saying his name the way her prefered it so quickly. He stood up and went over to the small kitchen area, before he turned around and looked at Asia with a small grin.\n\n\"Noted, and how about you and I get a bite to eat before hitting the sack?\" Naruto requested of the girl, and she blushed deeply when her stomach growled at the mention of food. She nodded quickly, and Naruto laughed with a large grin on his face. He could tell that he was going to enjoy having Asia living here. When his back was turned to her, his smile morphed into a frown for a moment when one question managed to find it's way into his mind.\n\nHow was he going to keep Rias from finding out about Asia?\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t15. Chapter 15 Charming Surprise\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Faster! Harder! Give me all you got!\" Naruto shouted as he dodged two sword strikes coming from the newest Pawns of Rias' peerage. Naruto dodged to the left, tilted to the right, ducked under another slash, and then he bent backwards to allow both blades to harmlessly pass over him. He raised his elbow to block a kick aimed at his head, and then he caught a punch thrown at him by Murayama. Naruto jerked her towards him and spun around so that Murayama was sent flying towards the nearest tree, smashing right into it and breaking the bark with her body. She gasped in pain as saliva shot from her gasping mouth, not having expected the extremnely powerful throw nor the strong jerk to her arm.\n\n\"Hiya!\" Katase shouted out as she used the sword that Yuuto had made for her to freeze the ground where Naruto had been standing, in her hands was a sword made up ice with a normal handle. In Murayama's hand was sword with a long black blade, but other than that it had nothing special about it other than the fact that it had been created by Yuuto's Sacred Gear, and the fact that instead of his usual western swords this one was styled like a Japanese sword. Naruto looked down at the ice on the ground, before he lifted his foot and brought it down on the ice hard enough to coimpletely shatter the entire ice patch under him. When she next swung her sowrd at him, he punched the side of the blade and shattered rthe ice that the sword blade was made up of.\n\nThis was more than enough time for Murayama to recover and run towards him from behind, hoping to score at least one hit for this sparring session against the smaller opponent. Naruto's ear twitched when he heard the sound of her feet running across the grass, and just as she swung her sword Naruto jumped into the air backwards while doing a flip over the girl just as she passed under him. A surprised look on her face was all that he got to see before he landed on the ground behind her in a crouched position, and using the marker that was in his left hand he slashed a black line across both of her legs with the black marker. Then he reached up and used his palm to press against her butt, before he sent her flying with a palm thrust with her blushing while in mid-air and covering her now hurting butt.\n\n\"Ow ow ow ow!\" Murayama shouted out in a surprising amount of pain, before she landed on her feet and started to bounce up and down while holding her butt with her hands. She had never known that a simple touch to the butt could hurt so freaking much when you were being attacked by the Queen of a peerage, showing that there was a major difference between Yuuto and Naruto's strength from when they would train under him. Katase grabbed another of the swords that Yuuto had left for them to train with, and she charged at Naruto and gave him a straight attempt at a slash aimed for his waist.\n\nNaruto caught the side of the sword with two fingers, before he flexed his fingers and broke the sword into two pieces. Naruto caught the blade half with his free hand, before he used the marker and made another line across Katase's face before she could react. Now that she was marked again, Naruto grabbed the front of her clothes and pulled her in close to him, before pushing her away and onto the ground nearby a small group of swords. She simply grunted in pain as her butt landed on the ground, but she was starting to get used to getting pushed around during training like this. Usually though it was Yuuto or Koneko that was pushing them around like they were nothing, but today Naruto was personally taking care of their battle training.\n\n\"Come on already nya, you need to try harder to land even a passing scratch on me.\" Naruto said truthfully, while his mind wandered back to his recent house guest. It had been a rough few days getting Asia to finally relax in his and Koneko's apartment, and the Fallen Angels were looking all over the city for Asia. It was plain to see, and while Rias was confused as to the increase of Fallen Angel activity Naruto couldn't bring himself to tell her that the reason they were more active was because they were looking for the Twilight Healing that Asia had inside her. The ability to heal others, and themselves was to much of a good thing for the Fallen Angels to pass up.\n\nKeeping Asia out of trouble, and keeping her out of Rias' eye was harder than he had thought. Rias knew him well enough to know that something was up, so he was trying to do the impossible by hiding the fact he was hiding something from Rias. The fact that she knew something was up with Naruto was enough cause for worry, but keeping Asia safe was his top priority, which meant that he would have to try and act as normal as possible. Without even thinking or paying attention, Naruto raised his forearm and blocked a sword without even getting a small cut thanks to the Rook part of his Queen abilities, both enhacing his defence and strength to amazing levels, meaning that swords of this level would be completely useless against him anyway. He waved his arm and knocked Murayama off balance, before she defended herself with the side of her sword when he swung the back of his hand at her side. He was blocked long enough for her to escape from the blow before he broke the current sword she was using.\n\n\"He is tougher than he looks, and those ears of his can predict out moves from how our feet are moving. His skin is too tough to cut into as well, at least with these swords. Katase, any ideas?\" Murayama asked her friend, trying to keep her voice down so that Naruto wouldn't hear them talking about a plan. naruto smiled at the teamwork, and decided not to listen to them make their plan. The plan for training was for them to get a solid hit on him, and even after an hour they had yet to land such a hit. That spoke volumes for theri stamina, but he could see that stamina was starting to become thinner. They were already covered in a moderate level of sweat, and their clothes were sticking to their bodies so that their underwear were visible even through their training clothes.\n\n\"I have nothing, we can't trick his ears. He can sense us coming without them anyway, and he is both faster and stronger with more experience... not to mention he is super cute. I feel bad just pointing a sword at him.\" Katase admitted to the biggest problem, while Murayama mentally agreed with that statement. She had extreme trouble actually trying to hurt Naruto even if this was just training. It was like trying to kick a small and cute animal, which tugged at her heart to much for her to be able to do at this moment. If it were somebody else this wouldn't be a problem, because they could always admit that nothing in training was permanent, but even in training you don;t hurt cute things.\n\n\"Darn, your right... on three?\" Murayama questioned her friend, and Katase nodded lightly with a smile on her face when she understood what Murayama was going for. Both of them pulled swords from the ground, before the stood back in front of Naruto with some form of determination on their faces. Naruto raised an eyebrow at them, before he noticed them tense up their legs. He crossed his arms and closed his eyes so that he would completely rely on his ears to tell when they would make their first step, but when the first step took more than four minutes to take Naruto seemed to be worried that they were planning something else.\n\nThen he heard the sound of ice creeping along what was left of the grass, slowing coming towards him in the hopes that it would touch him before he could do anything about it. Naruto lifted his leg in the air, before he crushed the ground in front of him and stopped the ice from growing any closer to him. Naruto opened his eyes with a smirk on his face just as one of the boulders that landed in front of him in a way that covered up his view of the girls. Naruto heard the sound of blades whistling through the air before he saw two swords go flying over the boulder, but without the girls holding them. Naruto caught the first sword by the handle and used it to defect the second sword, yet his eyes widened in a split second of surprise when both swords vanished and were replaced by Murayama and Katase. Murayama with her hand on his wrist, while Katase was crouched down on the ground on all fours.\n\n'Middle-Class Tranformation, where did they learn this? Rias doesn't normally let people learn magic from her books without them having the proper reserves for it.' Naruto thought in surprise when Murayama pulled him towards her and lifted him up over her shoulder. Naruto allowed this to happen, because he respected the strategy they had used to get him into this position. Now that he was paying attention, he could tell that they were each almost down to zero on their magic reserves, that one spell taking a large toll on their reserves. Naruto saw Katase panting on the ground with a slightly larger amount of sweat than Murayama on her face, while Murayama was barely keeping him over her shoulder.\n\n\"Very good you two, but when doing something like this you have to make sure you will have enough left in you to attack the opponent after you get them nya. If I was an enemy, I would use this chance to attack... you did not just spank me nya.\" Naruto finished his sentence with that statement instead of the lecture he was about to get into when he felt a hand lightly touch his butt. It wasn't enough to even sting him, but it was the princible behind the matter of him getting his butt spanked by one of these two that was somewhat strange.\n\n\"The point... was the land a good hit... on you. Couldn't bring myself to hit you... though.\" Murayama stated as szhe dropped him back onto his feet, before she collapsed on her butt just as he crossed his arms and started o shake his head gently with a chuckle. Naruto bent down and flicked her in the forehead hard enough to send her rolling towards her friend.\n\n\"That wasn't the point of this training, the training was so that you could learn to resist my Charm ability.\" Naruto explained, and he could tell that they were confused by what he was talking about. Naruto sighed lightly, before he decided that he would need to go into a bit more detail. \"The Charm ability is a type of Youjutsu that certain Yokai are able to use so that they can they can control the opposite, and sometimes same, sex. Only certain creatures have any talent for this ability, and some non-Youkai are able to use this ability naturally. Though, only Youkai actually call this ability Charm, Devil breeds that use this ability call it Allure or something.\" Naruto explained the ability a bit so that they would know what he had been using. With this ability he was able to provide a moments hesitation for his opponents to make it harder for them to bring out the will to hurt him. Nekoshou were one of the species of Yokai that were able to use the Charm Youjutsu ability, with this ability limited to beautiful humanoid Yokai it was easy to see why Nekoshou could use it in human form.\n\nThe list of Yokai that could use it was actually pretty limited, the known ones beimg Nekomata, Nekoshou, and Kitsune. The types of Devils that could use the Allure Ability it were the Succubus, the Incubus, Vampires, and one of the 72 pillar families.\n\n\"So the reason every girl in school is attracted to you is because of that Charm thing?\" Katase questioned now that she had her breath back, before both girls were surprised when Naruto chuckled lightly.\n\n\"I rarely use Charm at school, the only two times when I used it was because I was scouting and wanted to see if a girl could resist it. Only the weak minded, and those that are caught off guard are able to be caught under Charm. The Incubus and Succubus are able to capture harder people with their Allure, but when you know you are in a Charm or Allure you can fight it off much easier. Though it shouldn't be hard to shake off my Charm, since I never really practiced with it.\" Naruto explained with a sigh, he really didn't have a reason to use Charm when his natural kitten-like cuteness was more than enough for him to get people to do what he wanted them too. Not to mention that everyone else in Rias' peerage had strong enough minds that they could shrug off the Charm like it was nothing. Gasper himself was ABLE to use Allure, but he didn't know how to turn it off once he has it activated, making for some awkward moments where even people that knew he was a boy were turned on by him.\n\n\"So... you were trying to see if we could break out of this Allure thing?\" Murayama asked when she replayed all that she heard in her head, while Naruto shrugged.\n\n\"Charm, devils use the Allure. Yokai use Charm, which is a weaker form of Allure. I would say that the strongest known Charm is about 70 percent as strong as a full power Allure from a Vampire, which is about half as strong as a Succubus' Allure. My Charm isn't that strong because I don't really train with it, but if I wanted to I could make a human girl fall for me... I don't do that, but I could.\" Naruto admitted without any shame over the fact that there were people with a stronger form of his ability. Charm wasn't something that his family were very good at, and it wasn't that Nekoshou sucked at Charm, just that their family didn't have as much talent in it. Kuroka and he were much better at Battle-Type Youjutsu, instead of Effect-Type Youjutsu. It wasn't a weakness that they didn't have as much talent in one area of Youjutsu, not when they prefered Battle-Type Youjutsu anyway.\n\n\"So how do we notice that we are in it?\" Katase asked for her friend when she realised that she wanted to ask it, while Naruto shrugged. He himself had no idea how to break out, because he had a very strong mind. His mind kept him from being affected during the few times that somebody had tried to use Charm on him. Just because he could use it, didn't mean that he knew how to notice if he himself was in it or not. He hadn't been in a situation where he would need to learn it, and a strong enough one to affect him had never been used against him. Basically, he had no experience breaking out of them.\n\n\"That is for you to figure out, but I trust you two can do it. You are Rias' Pawns after all, and you need to have pride in your skills. Sharpen your mind and harden your heart to do what needs to be done... or something like that nya.\" Naruto said dully at the end, while scratching the top of his head. Katase and Murayama looked at each other and nodded with smiles, the way he said that was telling them that they didn't really have a choice in the matter. Looking at Naruto in unison they gave him determined looks.\n\n\"Use your Charm on us again.\" Both of the girls said as one, before Naruto looked at the time by gazing at the sun. He sighed lightly, before he gave the girls looks that gave them their answers. He didn't even have to say anything before they both deflated when they figured out that he had something he had to do, before they nodded in understanding.\n\nNaruto ran off and they remembered that even though he was only 15, Rias depended on him to do a lot of stuff for her. Naruto was usually a pretty busy boy because of this, and sometimes the free time he did have was interupted. Until Rias had a full peerage he would be very busy looking for more people that could become her peerage members, which ate up a lot of his time when he wasn't training or at school.\n\nWith Naruto now gone, both girls stopped pretending to be okay and collapsed on the ground while groaning.\n\nNaruto's training made sparring with Yuuto and Koneko seem tame in comparison, and when he hit you lightly it still felt like you would be feeling it in the morning.\n\nThey would be sticking with Yuuto and Koneko from now on, that was for sure.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Work was busy, so I didn't have as much free time today and yesterday.**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Project Maelstrom / Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\nFan letter to Yuuto the 'Walking Sword Works'  \n\"Do you ever get any problem from fan girls?\"\n\n\"No, not really. Most of the time they are pretty tame, that rumor about Fangirls all being completely insane is just that... a rumor. While they can be annoying with how they try and always get near you, they don't really bother you to much if you ask them to leave nicely.\" Yuuto asnwered with a raised eyebrow, he was wondering where the strange rumor that fangirls were viscious monsters came from anyway. They were just human after all, and while some were crazy, most were pretty normal.\n\nFan letter to Rias the 'Girl whom is very proud of her body'  \n\"Do you still watch Anime or read Manga?\"\n\n\"Of course, but with how busy I have been lately I haven't had the time for it. I do try and keep my... hobby secret though. I do have a reputation to keep up after all.\" Rias answered curtly, not giving any emotion that would show what she was feeling.\n\n\n\t16. Chapter 16 Sacred Eye\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter  \nGonna be busier with work for awhile, but I will still update as often as possible. Hopefully I can update once every day, or two days.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'Stupid Fallen Angels, running around like chickens with their heads cut off because they can't find Asia.' Naruto thought with a small grin on his face at how easy it was starting to become to keep Asia hidden away from the Fallen Angels without her even noticing. No, she noticed that he seemed to be hiding her from something, and he could tell from her scent that before now she had been in contact with Fallen Angels. Asia was just the kind of girl that knew what people she could and couldn't trust by nature, and when comparing Naruto and the Fallen Angels it was obvious that she would go with Naruto.\n\nOf course, not everything was great. Asia was a devote christian, which meant that she prayed before meals which caused Naruto and Koneko major headaches. She would constantly read from the bible, causing them physical pain and exhaustion. She prayed, which if she did in her head wouldn't be as bad, but she tried to get them involved in her praying. Koneko had decided that she would just never be in the same room as the one she had labled as the 'Prayer Girl', but Naruto pushed through the pain and allowed her to stay as true to her faith as a girl that was living in the same apartment as a devil could. Speaking of which, he still hadn't told her that part about himself.\n\nAsia was currently attempting to cook Naruto and Koneko a home cooked meal as thanks for letting her stay here, and unknown to Naruto she was also thanking him for becoming her friend. The blond haired girl looked at Naruto sitting on the couch while reading a strange book, before she giggled into her hand with a blush on her cheeks. She had to admit that while Naruto made sure he was always with her when she left the house, that she was having a lot of fun with him around her. Naruto noticed her giggle, while Koneko got up and went to her room to use the teleporation circle and go to the clubroom without Asia finding out. She had made sure to keep the same secret from Asia that Naruto was.\n\n\"Otouto, you got a call from Buchou earlier. She seems to think you are... hiding something.\" Koenko said as she closed the door to her room, and Naruto flinched lightly at the fact that Rias was now surely going to try and figure out what he was hiding. Naruto stood up and cracked his neck slightly, before he looked at the oblivious Asia with a small cat-like grin on his face contrasting what he was feeling on the inside. She smiled back at him while she had a confused look on her face, so deciding that it was time that Asia made some friends other than him Naruto deicded that it was time to introduce Asia to the one of the few people that Naruto was friends with that Rias didn't know about. The only difference being that he wasn't hiding this person, and Rias knew that this person... these people existed as the ones that wanted to become apart of his peerage one day. Of course, there were only two of them, but he figured that Asia would like to meet his non-devil friends.\n\nNaruto went over to see what Asia was cooking, only to sweat drop when he noticed that she hadn't actually started cooking yet. He guessed that she was still trying to decifer what his cook book was saying, most likely because of the fact that she wasn't Japanese.\n\n\"Hey Asia, how about we eat out tonight. I was going to meet my friends, and I was wondering if you wanted to meet them as well. One of them is from America so they can speak English, while the other is able to speak both Japanese and English. I am sure that you would get along great with them.\" Naruto suggested instead of what Asia was currently trying to do. Tonight was the night of the month they usually hung out as a group anyway, and while Rias was aware of both of these people she only knew that Kyokan was planning on becoming apart of his peerage.\n\n\"I would love to, but shouldn't you invite Koneko as well? She is your sister after all.\" Asia pointed out, while Naruto chuckled in his own head. There was no wya that Koneko was spe nding any extended time around Kyokan, not when the tall beauty was OVER 2 feet taller than either him or Koneko. The height difference didn't bother him to much, but what bothered Koneko even more was the fact that Kyokan was so much taller and had a fuller figure. even more so when one considered the fact that Kyokan was only 16 years old, only a single year older than Naruto and Koneko themselves. At the age of 16 Kyokan had an even bigger bust, and better hips than even Akeno... if only her height didn't scare away most guys she would be pretty popular. Well, maybe not when you considered the fact she was home schooled by her mother.\n\nAnyway, Koneko wouldn't willingly hand out around the giant of a woman, not when Kyokan made her look even more like a kid in comparison... Naruto completely blamed the Giant and Cyclops DNA in the girl. It made her mature faster so that she could grow to her full height quicker, even though she was still growing into her full height still. What could he say, her family got pretty big... very big.\n\n\"Don't worry about Koneko, she has something important of her own to take care of. She will be okay on her own, but I don't want you to feel cooped up in here. I am sure that it can be pretty boring.\" Naruto stated with a sorry tone of voice, and frankly he wouldn't be surprised if she really was bored of this place after a week of staying here. The only time that she really left was when Naruto was with her so that he could make sure that she didn't come across any Fallen Angels, and it wasn't like he could openly say he was going to protect her without starting a fight. Something that affected more than just him and Asia, it affected much more than them.\n\n\"Then I would love to meet your friends! I am sure that they are great people if they are friends of yours.\" Asia complimented without having to think about it. Naruto nodded in thanks lightly, before he grinned. He was very sure that Asia was going to be regretting those words when she came across the two that he was refering to. Naruto nodded to Asia and grabbed her hand as a flood of her positive emotion hit him like a wave of unrelenting pleasure, almost causing him to shudder in joy at the feeling of his own good mood being enhanced by her good mood.\n\nNaruto was sure that his friends would just adore Asia, and that she would get along with them just fine.\n\n**- A Little While Later -**\n\n'Oh Jesus that is a big woman.' Asia thought with wide eyes as she layed her green eyes on the tall and full figure of Kyokan. Today she was wearing a deep V neck t shirt that was colored black, and the stomach of the shirt was cut off so that her stomach was revealed. This how cased that she had an amazing muscle tone and definition even under her clothes, and instead of the skirts that girls these days wore she instead wore purple skinny jeans in comparison to her size, and on the back of her butt were pink words saying 'Not my Eyes Perv' which would attract many eyes on it's own. Asia couldn't see her eye color because of the sunglasses the blonde girl wore to hide the fact that she only had a right eye, with her hair covering the left part of her sunglasses to be extra careful.\n\nCurrently Kyokan as Naruto had refered to her as on the way over here had Naruto high up in the air with a strange smile on her lips as she lifted the smaller person high up. Naruto didn't seem to mind the attention all that much, and then Asia noticed the second person in the group that she hadn't ever seen before. Naruto hadn't really said anything about his second friend on the way over here, and Asia could see why.\n\nNaruto seemed to make it a hobby of making friends with people taller than him, because the second person that Asia noticed was another male that stood at around 6 feet tall easily, maybe an inch or two more. He didn't really have a readable expression on his face, and his hair was a mess... like he had woke up from bed just a few minutes ago, and it was a bit shorter than Naruto's hair. Yet, isntead of being a spiked mess like Naruto's it was more tame. The dirty blond locks didn't hide the amusement in those Blue-Gray eyes in the slightest, and she said Blue-Gray because each eye was a different color. The left eye being blue, while the right eye was gray. His tan was a little bit lighter than Naruto's, and he was wearing rather simple clothes. Nothing to fancy, just a red t shirt and black pants, but he did stand out by wearng sandles instead of shoes.\n\n\"Sacred Gear holder? What the hell Naruto, I thought that you were coming alone.\" The guy said in a surprisingly thick accent, and Asia tilted her head in confusion when she realized that he was speaking Japanese instead of English. Standing up when he noticed her confusion, the maybe 17 years old boy bowed deeply while getting down on one knee. He switched between Japanese and English the second time he spoke with her, and when he looked up he seemed to be saying sorry with his eyes while he spoke. \"I am sorry Miss, but Naruto has never brought anyone else with him before when we meet up. I was just surprised that he found another Sacred Gear holder. My name is Blaze R. Bolding, and it is a pleasure to meet you.\" Blaze stated as he stood back up and nodded at her, before he noticed that Naruto had jumped out of Kyokan's arms and landed on the ground right next to Blaze.\n\n\"You have a Sacred Gear too?!\" Asia asked in shock, she had just told Naruto the other day that she had a special ability to heal people, and here was another person that had a Sacred Gear.\n\n\"My eye allowed me the ability to understand the proper way to use weapons, and gives me a high affinity for using weapons because of this. If I know the name of a weapon, and can see it, then I will be able to use it so long as my body is strong enough to use the weapon.\" Blaze stated proudly for a moment at his Sacred Gear, and while it was useless when he didn't have a weapon with him, it made him pretty deadly when he did have a weapon, and it gave him the ability to see how weapons were going to be used against him in a way. Asia looked at Naruto to see if this was true, and he nodded.\n\n\"Blaze's Sacred gear is known as the War God's Keen Eye, because so long as his body can handle the stress he is able to use any weapon with amazing skill and grace. The downside is that this ability is useless if he is weaponless, or his opponent is fighting him with only hand to hand combat.\" Naruto explained with a bit more detail, and while this was a Unique Sacred Gear like Asia's Twilight Healing, it wasn't nearly as usefull in everyday life or if certain conditions weren't met. It was why Blaze prefered not to get involved with Devils, because he didn't have a weapon strong enough to defend himself with right now.\n\n\"Hello Asia, I am Kyokan, but you have no doubt heard a ton about me from Naruto. You can forget about Blaze here, because he spends most of his time training. We should totally hang out sometime! Go do girl stuff... as soon as I learn what girls do with their friends.\" Kyokan suggested with Naruto and Blaze staring at the seen with a twitching eye, being completely forgotten as the two girls talked to each other was kind of lame. Naruto nudged one of his surprisingly few males firneds in the side, before the two of them left the girls to talk to each other. Kyokan had gotten the small signal to keep Asia distracted, while Naruto and Blaze ducked behind a few tress and turned serious.\n\n\"Okay, now that the Giant Pain in my Ass is keeping the Nun busy, why in the Underworld are you bringing a Nun to one of our meetings? You keep this a secret from the Gremory girl, but take a Nun along for the fun?\" Blaze questioned with a raised eyebrow, having been wondering what had been going on since he had seen the cross on the girl's chest. Naruto leaned against the tree and sighed lightly.\n\n\"I promised I would protect her, and the Fallen Angels are after her. Unlike you, her Sacred Gear doesn't have conditions that need to be fufilled before it can be used. They want her Sacred Gear so that they can heal themselves in battle most likely. The Twilight Healing is a Holy Sacred gear, BUT it still has the power to heal Angels, Humans, Devils, Fallen Angels, and basically anything that is hurt. That kind of power is amazing.\" Naruto explained half of the situationl, leaving out the part about how he himself WANTED for Asia to stay nearby him where he could protect her pure soul. Blaze closed his right eye, before he nodded and sighed.\n\n\"I expected as much from you, even siding with your natural enemy because you can't leave a pure soul behind... don't think I will fall for the Fallen Angel thing being your ONLY reason. I could tell just by looking at you that you seem to already hold this girl in a special place. I don't care if this damns me, but if you need any help don't be afraid to call me... I am human after all. I can kill those Fallen Angels without starting a war between the factions.\" Blaze offered truthfully, his respect for Naruto being the only thing that made him want to offer his help in the first place. Naruto smirked and raised his fist, while Blaze met him in the middle as the two men bumbed fists and nodded.\n\n\"Thanks, but no thanks. If I need help though, I will ask you and Kyokan first.\" Naruto said back to Blaze, while the Sacred gear holder nodded and started to walk back to the group of two girls with Naruto now that they had finished their talk. The two came upon the seen of Asia being hugged to death by a grinning Kyokan, who was rubbing Asia's cheek against her own cheek. The blonde girls looked like they were getting along very well, and because of this Naruot decided that maybe he should see if he could get Kyokan to agree to looking after Asia when he wasn't able to, because for some reason he had the feeling that something bad was going to happen soon.\n\nThe sound of a bats wings flapping could be heard as a small blur moved out of the area, and Naruto moved his head in the direction that he heard the sound.\n\nOh crap...\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next Questions Omake: Ch.20**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Project Maelstrom / Naruto the Strange Mage**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t17. Chapter 17 Truth\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto's face jerked to the side when a hand smacked him in the whiskered cheek, and those around him winced for him when they saw the annoyed look on Rias' face. As he had guessed, she had sent her familiar to follow him and gather proof that he was doing something behind her back. As it would turn out, while she trusted him with her life, what she didn't like was him keeping any secrets from her. Not to mention that fact that his current action was going passed the barrier of what they really were. Those that hadn't seen Rias angry before were looking at her in surprise over her actions, while only those that truly knew her knew that she would never lay a hand on somebody like that without having a good reason for her actions.\n\nThe fact it wasn't a secret that to Rias, Naruto was her most prized peerage member abd best friend that stood head over shoulders above the others. She must have been VERY angry with him if she would even think of slapping him, and Naruto must have known this would eventually have happened if he just took the slap without complaint. You could see the tears that were barely visible at the sides of her eyes, while Naruto seemed to have a slightly sour expression on his visage.\n\n\"Naruto, you of all people should know better than to befriend a member of the Biblical God's Church. Explain yourself.\" Rias demanded, giving him the chance to explain why he had been protecting Asia was the best thinmg she could do right now. Rias was frankly appalled at Naruto right now, because not only was he risking his own life for somebody Rias couldn't care less about, but he was also risking the Fallen Angels declaring war on the Devils again. The truce was barely held up these days, and you never knew what could set off another war between the factions. If the Fallen Angels and Devils went to war again, then the Angels would take out the winner while they were still weakened.\n\n\"Asia doesn't deserve to lose her life because she was dealt a bad hand. In promised myself I would protect her, there is not much else to say.\" Naruto stated very simply, but his tone indicated to Rias that he had no plans to give up on defending Asia. Rias sighed in annoyance, while Issei asked the question that was on his mind since this entire thing happened.\n\n\"Why is Naruto is trouble again?\" Issei couldn't help but question the one thing that didn't seem normal about this situation. He on one hand completely agreed with defending somebody that was dealt a bad hand in life, so he didn't understand what was so wrong about it. He just couldn't understand any of this because of how new he was to this entire devil thing. Frankly, if it was him he would be defending Asia as well... if she was cute that was. He hadn't seen this Asia girl yet, so he had no way of knowing if she would be cute.\n\n\"Devils aren't suppose to have anything to do with the Church anymore, and housing a Nun is something that has the chance of sparking a war between Devils, Fallen Angels, and Angels again. If that happened, then there is a good chance that the Devils would be wiped out for the most part. Only the most powerful of Devils would survive, while the Fallen Angels would have the support of the Angels in wiping us out.\" Akeno explained to Issei quietly so that he would be caught up on the basics on what was going on, and why what Naruto was doing was not only a crime against nature, but also extremely stupid on his part. Taking Asia in was something that could risk war, which very few Devils would survive at this point in time. In the last few centuries the quality and strength of many Devils had decreased, with Reincarnated Devils being the only advantage they would have in the war. Out of Rias' peerage, the only people that would have a chance to survive a war were Rias herself, Naruto, and Akeno because of their powers were not completely based in what one would expect. Not to mention that each of them carried powerful blood in them, and while Koneko carried to same, almost exactly the same, blood as Naruto she refused to use that blood to her advantage.\n\n'War sounds freaking scary.' Murayama thought while rubbing her friends back when she saw tht Katase was shaking lightly from the fright of the thought of war.\n\n\"Stop lying to me, you always have a reason for doing the things you do. You KNOW that I have always forbidden my peerage from interacting with the Church and those with ties with the Church. You have always followed my orders, so why are you rebelling now of all times?\" Rias asked with narrowed green eyes, and while Naruto knew that he should be angry at Rias for this he just couldn't be mad at her for looking out for him.\n\n\"I always keep my promises, and I promised to protect her. What more do you want me to say? I am not breaking my promise Rias. I don't care if I die doing this, because I have already made peace with the possibility that this promise will kill me in the end.\" Naruto's determination was visible in his eyes as he spoke gently, a maturity that exceeded his years showed underneath his usual happy eyes. Rias' hand shot out again and slapped Naruto the second he said that he was willing to die, and now she was mad at Naruto for a whole new reason. Yuuto saw that this was going to end up badly when he noticed that Koneko was glaring at both Naruto and Rias, so to try and avert a problem he placed his hand on Koneko's shoulder and teleported themj both out of the room. His decision was a good one, because moments later Murayama followed his example and teleported the enraged Katase out of the room before she could explode as well.\n\n\"Don't you ever say you don't care about your life again Naruto, you are not allowed to die before me. I won't allow you to give your life doing something so stupid, so from here on I forbid you from having anything to do with this girl. Kick her out of the apartment, because I won't have her creating a rift between us.\" Rias spoke with not a small amount of anger in her tone, her hand stinging from slapping Naruto. She looked at the handprint on his cheek with a small twing of guilt, before she noticed the defiance in his eyes still there,\n\n\"No, I made a promise to protect her. I have to refuse your order Rias. Asia is to much of a nice person to let die from having her Sacred Gear extracted. She is the purest soul I have ever seen in my life, and I refuse to let that purity vanish from the world.\" Naruto rejected Rias order without a seconds hesitation, while the King of the group stepped back lightly at how Naruto wasn't backing down on this. No, not only that but he was being honest when he said that this Asia girl had the purest soul he had ever seen. For Naruto, a pure soul like this girl would be like a water to a man in the middle of the desert. She bite the inside of her cheek when she realized that like a drug, Naruto was addicted to this girl's presence. For somebody that was used to the souls of devils and other 'impure' people Asia must be like the ultimate drug for him. He couldn't get enough of her, because she was simply far to addicting for him to give up.\n\nAkeno on the other hand, was thinking along different lines.\n\n\"Ara ara, it would seem that the kitten has fallen in love with a wayward Nun. How romantic, just like Romeo and Juliet wouldn't you say Gasper-kun?\" Akeno asked one of the few people that had continued to stay in the room, and Rias gasped at Akeno's statement when Naruto blushed and looked away from the others.\n\n'Didn't Romeo and Juliet end in both of them killing themselves though?' Gasper thought as he tried to remember how that story ended for the star crossed lovers. The extremely girly boy was not sure what happened, but if he was right then he too would be against Naruto hanging around Asia. Naruto was the only person in the peerage that was completely immune to the majority of his Sacred Gear. He couldn't bear the thought if any of his friends were killed, Naruto even more so.\n\n\"Don't be stupid Akeno. I don't like Asia... I just think that it is unfair for her to die because she is special.\" Naruto managed to say since he was in doubt of his own feelings. He would admit to being confused in private company, but he was kind of embarrassed about the fact that he didn't know what he was feeling about Asia. He wanted to protect her, but at the same time he felt an urge deep down to be the one to corrupt her with his perversion. He wanted to take her purity himself, and for the first time in his entire life he truly felt the urges of a devil starting to bubble up inside him.\n\nHe didn't like it.\n\n\"I. Don't. Care. This girl is bad for you, for us, and for all of devil kind if a war breaks out over this. I don't care what I have to do, but you aren't seeing her again. I will call Kuroka and/or Grayfia and ask her to punish you if I have to, because this is something I won't be budging on. Her 'pure soul' means nothing to me when I weigh her value against youyr value. She can go die for all I care, so long as you live.\" Rias said in complete honesty, something that frankly shocked the others in the room. That was before some of them remembered that while all of them were Reincarnated Devils, Rias was Pure-Blood Devil that was born into her role in life. She was raised with the mindset that the Church were the bad guys, well, being from the Gremory she wasn't exactly taught that completely. She was taught the importance of keeping the truce between the factions going. Asia meant nothing when compared to thousands or even millions of lives if the humans get involved.\n\nSuffice to say, when you compare one life to many, you normally pick the many.\n\nUnless you were Naruto that is.\n\n\"... I promised I would protect her, and I will. This is an order that I won't follow Rias. I am sorry, but I will never break my promises nya.\" Naruto stated as he ran over to the window and ran out of it full speed. He knew that he used the magic circle that Rias could just follow him, and that would lead her right to Asia right now. He heard them call out to him, but without Yuuto in the room they didn't have the speed to catch up to him even when they were flying. He jumped through the trees, and he though about the situation for what it was. He had been given the chose of obeying Rias like a good cat, or disobeying her and promising himself punishment later at the pay out of him being able to protect Asia. He knew that he would be punished the second he got into this, so he wasn't afraid of that.\n\nAsia was literally the ONLY person he had met that had no alternate motives behind her kindness, she was kind for the sake of being kind. How could he just let a person like that die, just because it was 'wrong' for him to protect her.\n\nNaruto didn't abandon his friends, he just couldn't allow somebody to die if he was friends with them. Naruto pulled out his cellphone and started to type in some words, before he sent the message to both of his friends that weren't with Rias and the devils. People that could help him without getting into trouble.\n\n[Things went to shit, grab Asia and meet me at Blaze's house.] - Naruto\n\nWith that sent Naruto knew that he wouldn't have to worry about much after this, because as much of a freak Blaze could be about people coming to his house, he knew that if 'things went to shit' then that bwas pretty much like declaring war on somebody. War was something that Blaze would enjoy if he got to fight strong people, and Fallen Angels were naturally above human abilities most of the time. Blaze would relish the the chance to fight against them, while Kyokan was somebody that loved to fight if it meant that she was following an order that Naruto gave. Naruto's phone started to ring, and he looked at it to see that both of them had responded quickly.\n\n[I am with Asia, and am now leading her to the idiots Weapon Cave.] - Kyokan\n\n[What?! Why my house? I JUST got my weapons organized again... forget it, I will be waiting for you all.] - Blaze\n\nNaruto smirked lightly when he read the texts, and while he felt bad for going against Rias, this was something that he needed to do. There was no other way around it, so he may as well try and enjoy himself while he was travelling a road that would end with his punishment at the hands of Grayfia or his own sister... maybe even Rias if things went screwy.\n\nOh who was he kidding, there was no if. He was Naruto, things ALWAYS went screwy when he was involved.\n\nNaruto covered his butt out of instinct when he remembered the last time he had been pranked by Grayfia as punishment for getting her with a prank that he had meant for Sirzechs... who knew that she would be pissed about the fact he dyed her hair purple to fuck with her husband after the last prank he did that made Sirzechs afraid of the color purple. He had thought that the image of the Satan runnining around naked as he tried to get away from his purple haired wife was freaking hilarious.\n\nIt almost made the pain worth it, almost, if he had not lost the ability to sit on his butt for half a week that is.\n\nThat isn't even to mention the fact that Kuroka would punish him by replacing all his clothes with girls clothes, prank him, or the worst thing of all... she would tell embarrassing stories that would make his friends look at him strangely. Sometimes having an older sister that knew everything about you, and loved to tease you was a bad thing.\n\nHe didn't know what was worse, the literal pain in his ass, or the humiliation of Kuroka punishing him.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**New Poll: How Will Naruto Be Punished?

Chapter 18 The War Begins\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"This place is... nice?\" Asia tried to say when the group got together at Blaze's house, the only place that Rias didn't know about at this moment in time. The reason that Asia was conflicted on the idea of being here was because of all of the different weapons that lined the walls of the basement in the home of the young dual eye colored male. She gulped lightly when she saw that every weapon was placed in a group, and each group had at least five different weapons collected in it. Some even had around ten or fifteen weapons in the group, with some of the weapons being things that looked like they weren't even legal.\n\nBlaze was actually polishing a LARGE rifle, and she looked at the lable that was on the weapon and was glad that it was in english so that she would read it. Right now the group were waiting for Naruto to show up, with Kyokan having brought her here a few moments ago. Blaze noticed that she was eyeing his gun, before he picked it up with a prideful expression on his face.\n\n\"Thanks, these are the weapons I have gotten my hands on over the years. This is the pride and joy of my guns collection. The Panzerbuchse 39, a gun used in Nazi Germany during the second world war. Only 39,232 of these bad boys were built, and currently only 1,989 exist in working condition. This baby can shoot anti tank piercing bullets at 1210 meters a second, has a penetration ability of 25 mm armor at 330 yards, and shoots about 10 rounds a minute. Say want you want about the Nazi's, they had great weapons. This one is over five feet long, and weighs more than most people would be comfy with carrying.\" Blaze explained with a look of joy on his face when explaining the prized piece of his collection, and while it wasn't the most powerful Anti-tank rifle it was certainly one of the most impressive ones that you could find. He had been keeping this thing in working order, and he had made enough ammo for it to last him quite awhile if he ever went to war with somebody. Of course, it would seem that this bad boy was going to get a work out sometime soon.\n\n\"Asia, don't let yourself get infected by the war idiot. His mind is always on the battlefield, and I think that if he could have sex with his weapons he would.\" Kyokan taunted the war freak, before he scoffed and started to wipe down the gun again. He and Kyokan wouldn't be friends if it weren't for Naruto introducing them. Him, a war loving man that was cursed with a Sacred Gear that causes the weilder to have an increased blooslust and desire for lide threatening violence. Her, a kind human/cyclops/giant hybrid that had a thing for small guys and wished to become a devil so that she could spend a longer life with said smaller guy. They were mostly opposites, which made thinsg fun.\n\n\"Screw you, at least my crush isn't half my size and a tenth my weight.\" Blaze said before he was flicked in the head by the large and blushing girl, before being sent flying into a pile of ammo that was shattered all around the floor. His limbs were hanging out of the pile, while he was bleeding from the head comically for a bit.\n\n\"Don't comment on a ladies weight, and I will have you know that the ONLY reason I weight a lot is because all the muscles in my body are super compacted. Muscle weighes more than fat, and even with my muscle I have a figure that most women would kill for!\" Kyokan lectured in a slightly louder voice than before. It was true, and she was proud of the fact that she had a figure that most girls would kill for. It wasn't her fault that she weighed a lot more than the average person because of how dense her body was, nor was it her fault that she prefered her guys to be small... okay, that one was her fault.\n\n\"... OW!? What the hell!? It's the truth, and I wasn't calling you fat! I was just stating that you weigh a lot more than Naruto, and are a hell of a lot taller than him! Dear GOD that hurt you monster strength cyclops!\" Blaze shouted as his hand finally went to his head, with Kyokan only sticking her tongue out at him childishly. Asia rushed to Blaze and placed her now glowing green hands on his head were he was bleeding, and seconds later the wound was completely gone. He blinked in surprise when he felt the pain in his head vanish, before he willingly admit to himself that Asia had a pretty damn good Sacred Gear inside her.\n\n\"Please don't fight, fighting isn't a very nice thing to do between friends.\" Asia pleaded softly, a tone of softness to her voice that made the two of them realize that she was a person that hated to see others hurt in any way. That was why when they started to laugh she blinked and looked at the two fot ehm in pure confusion. Honestly, one second they were like bitter enemies, and now they were laughing together. She didn't know what to make of such an odd relationship.\n\n\"We fight BECAUSE we are friends. This is how things have always been between us, and while we wouldn't be friends without Naruto, we show our friendship differently. This big breasted buffon is the only person besides Naruto that tries to stand up to me anymore these days.\" Blaze admitted as he pointed his thumb at the tall beauty, while she shrugged lightly at the nickname he was using for her. She would admit to not being all that smart half of the time, but buffon was going a bit to far.\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly say friends... more like two people that have similar goals. I want to live my life by Naruto's side, and he respects Naruto enough that he wishes to follow the person he views as his general into 'war' like the war freak he is.\" Kyokan stated with a neutral tone to her voice. It was true on both parts, both of her being the in love with Naruto, and Blaze wanting to follow him into battle thanks to his respect for Naruto. They were about to go further, before the door opened to the basement and the sound of small feet coming down were heard, Blaze groaned when two high pitched voices made themselves known.\n\n\"Brudder, are you down here brudder!?\" The first child's voice was heard, and the second one was heard moments later saying the exact same thing. When they were at the bottom of the stairs Asia's eyes widened lightly when she saw two small children coming downstairs. Each child couldn't be more than five years old, and both of them looked almost exactly the same.\n\n\"Nathan, Jonathan... what has Mom said about coming down here. You know that these weapons are dangerous. Go back upstairs boys.\" Blaze stated with his hand on the left half of his face, a small blush showing when the two girls saw his little brothers. The two children rushed over to him, and jumped on him while giggling like only children could truly do. He knew what they wanted, and picking them both up and shrugging them over his shoudlers, Blaze sent the two a look before he started his way upstairs with both of the children over his shoulders.\n\n'His little brothers are so annoying.' Kyokan thought as she heard the door close upstairs, before she frowned when after a few minutes later of awkward silence between her and Asia Blaze didn't coming back down. Her answer appeared on her phone seconds later in the form of a text from Blaze.\n\n[There is a group of weird woman in a trench coat walking towards the house. Fallen Angel. Get Asia, and get out. I will take care of anyone else that shows up. Contact Naruto and tell him that the meeting location has changed to the park.] - Blake\n\n\"Come on Asia, you and I are getting out of here.\" Kyokan said right after reading the text as she picked Asia up physically by the waist and put her over her shoulder, before she made her way to the special tunnel in the wall that would lead to the exit in the backyard of Blaze's home. Asia blushed heavily at being picked up like a child, before the two of them exited the tunnel and started to run towards the woods right next to Blaze's house. Asia didn't even know why she was being carried away like this, but it had to be pretty bad for this giant of a person to seem worried about something.\n\n\"Where are we going so quickly?\" Asia asked when Kyokan jumped over a fence and started to run in a dead sprint at a speed that was actually pretty fast considering her weight. It was all in the long legs and power of the muscle, before she stopped and smelled the air for a second. Then she changed direction and began to run away from where she was headed. Getting out her phone, she started to text out a message and sent it to Naruto right away.\n\n[Fallen Angels and Exiled Priests are at the park, and another Fallen Angel is on our tail. Changing location to my house.] - Kyokan\n\n'How do they know our movements like this. It is like they are seeing us from a... bird's eye view. Those cunts, they can totally see us from the air!' Kyokan thought in understanding and anger when she realized that they were being smart about their attacks and using one of the Fallen Angels to watch them all from the sky now that Asia was out of Devil Territory. She grit her teeth and changed direction again, but this time she started to run in the opposite direction of her own house. She was glad she did, because a few minutes later she got a message from Naruto.\n\n[At least ten Priests are stalking around your house waiting for us, we are being watched from the sky. Avoid being in direct view of large open areas, and stick to well hidden areas. Blaze texted me, and he is about to make contact with the first enemy. Be careful.] - Naruto.\n\n\"... Asia, do you know that you are a target for Fallen Angels?\" Kyokan asked the big question with a narrowed eye at the fact that she wasn't sure how much that Asia new at this point. The girl looked at the ground in shame, and that was all the answer that she needed to know that Asia was aware of the fact that Naruto had been hiding her from Fallen Angels.\n\n**-With Blaze-**\n\n\"Mom, grab the boys and escape. Shit is about to hit the fan, and it is going to be splattered everywhere.\" Blaze said as he placed a belt on that had two different kinds of swords sheathed at his waist. He clipped two hand guns to the back of his belt, and he carried ammo strapped to his chest in a cross styled carry. Attatched the the front of his belt was a small hammer, and on his left arm was a bronze shield. The final piece of weaponry that was visible on his body was small dagger that was strapped to the inside of his right thigh.\n\n\"Kick their asses honey!\" A voice called from another room, and the voice was a little deep for a female, but with how popular smoking was these days Blake had always considered that the reason that his mother had a deep voice for a woman. At least she had started to quit that habit of hers.\n\n\"Beat um up brudder!/Win Brudder!\" The voices of the twins called out, before the sound of the backdoor closing was heard. Blaze smirked and started to draw his sword as his right eye started to glow lightly when his Sacred Gear became truly active.\n\n\"Don't worry, I plan to win this war.\" Blaze said as the door burst open and the moonlight filled up the darkened rooms, and Blaze ran forward without any hesitation.\n\nThe war had just begun.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure / Naruto the Great Z fighter**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t19. Chapter 19 War Mongers\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"It took you long enough to show up Fallen Angel, and here I thought I was going to have to hunt you and your little army down.\" Blaze stated from his spot in his own living room. He had a dark grin on his face, while his right eye shined with an evil light. The activation of his war lusting Sacred Gear was clear, and his murderous thoughts of slicing and shooting the woman in front of him were barely restrained by his will power to remain himself for the entire fight. He wanted to enjoy the firts fight of many, because he hadn't had a good fight in awhile.\n\nThe woman in front of him was clearly a Fallen Angel due to the pitch blake feathered wings coming out of her back, not even hidden to try and fool him into coming with her quietly to be used for his Sacred Gear. This woman was tall, almost standing at 6 foot, and her long dark blue hair fell the her back and split out of her face in a mature fashion. Showing her equally dark blue eyes, and pale skin. She wore a collored trench coat that was open at the cleavage, and showing that she had an amazing bust size. The sleeves of her coat were rolled up, and her belly button was showing thanks to the fact she was loosely wearing her clothes. Her thighs were sowing thanks to how short the trenchcoat was on her as well, but that was only a small issue.\n\n\"So you noticed I wasn't alone, very astute for a lowly human. Sacred Gear or not, your entire species doesn't equate to much more than an energy source for greater beings. I already know just who you are, and I am glad that I am the one to take your Sacred Gear from you Blaze R. Bolding, holder of the War God's Keen Eye.\" The woman stated as her uniformed men started to make their way into the house, and each of them seemed like your average goon. All of them were dressed in the same body covering outfits, and all of them had black head masks that only had to eye holes to see out of with hats on their head. Every one of them had a sword as well, each sword was glowing bright white thanks to the holy power radiating off of it.\n\n'Eleven goons, and a Fallen Angel... those odds aren't in my favor in such a confined space. The Fallen Angel is the only real threat at this moment, but if I'm not careful one of those goons will get in a lucky shot.' Blaze thought as his mind went to the things Naruto had told him about real battle. It didn't matter how strong you were, if your opponent was holding most of the cards the odds were going to be stacked against you. Then if they got in a lucky shot you would be weakened enough so that they could get in more shots. If he was hit even once, his chances of winning this would be dropped down to at least 25 percent if the hit was bad enough. Right now he would admit that he only had about a 40 percent chance of winning this fight. He closed his Sacred Gear, before he opened his eye again to show his joy at the coming bloodshed. \"Tell me this Fallen Angel, who are you, and why is it that you are MY Sacred Gear?\" Blaze asked the woman in front of him, and she chuckled lightly and waved her hand around like she was swatting a mildly annoying insect.\n\n\"Kalawarner, and I want MY future Sacred Gear because with it I will be able to use nearly any weapon in the world. Once I have it, then all I would have to do is find some amazingly powerful Holy or Demonic Weapons and I will become unstoppable. As I am, I am unable to use swords like the Excalibur Fragments, but with your Sacred Gear I can bypass that and use them as I wish. You might not have a Sacred Gear that packs the power of a Longinus, and without a weapon it is useless, but with the right weapon it is a force to be considered. I want that power for myself. Kill him.\" Kalawarner ordered to her men after giving her speech, not caring much for their safety as the three closest of Blaze rushed forward with their battle cries ablazing with a fury. Their Light Swords were in mid swing when Blaze pulled out both of his pistols and shot two of them in the head, blood gushing from the holes in the front and brains flying our of the back and splattering on the walls as he killed two out of three of them in cold blood. The third one hesitated for a moment at the sight of his comrades deaths, and when Blazer noticed that hesitation he moved his arm and pointed his gun right at the third man's chest.\n\n\"Boom wannabe priest.\" Blaze stated coldy as he shot the man through the heart, and he went limp as he grunted in agony before dying before he could hit the ground. Blaze stepped to the side to allow the man to hit the floor, and start to get his lifeless blood all over the carpet. Blaze winced at how his mother was going to yell at him for staining the carpet with blood again, before he looked up and gazed at the amused Kalawarner with a spark of challenge in his eyes.\n\n\"I have to admit, you timed that perfectly. In two seconds you killed three of my men, and in such short range.\" Kalawarner said, before she summoned a spear of light in her hand and swung her yellow spear just in tgime to deflect three bullets he shot at her without flinching. Blaze started to run forward right at her, and in responce she stood in place and threw her spear at him while forming a second spear in her other hand. Blaze jumped and twisted his body so that the yellow light attack would go over his body, and rolling on the ground so that he was laying in front of Kalawarner, he aimed both guns at her before he pulled the triggers. Much like a movie, Kalawarner barely moved to avoid the bullets, and in that time Blaze hopped to his feet and aimed his left gun at her head, while pointing the right one at a charging goon.\n\n\"Compliments won't stop me from killing you Fallen Angel.\" Blaze commented as he fired his gun and killed another goon, dropping the goon count from the previous eleven all the way down to seven. One of the priests actually got smart and made a break for the door, before he was impaled through the chest with a yellow spear of light thrown by Kalawarner.\n\n\"Anyone else want to try and run away? I don't allow cowards to live, and running from a fight is a coward's move. Now is any of you want to live, then you will attack this punk like your life depends on it.\" Kalawarner threatened with narrowed eyes, before she tilted her head and got out of the way when Blaze kicked it her with his free leg. He spun on the foot standing on the ground, before he pointed his gun at her again and fired off another bullet. This time her reflexes weren't enough to stop her from getting hit when a gushing cut appeared on the side of her cheek. In responce, she made a spear of light and swung it at him from point blank. He smirked very lightly and corssed his guns in front of his face to catch the attack head on.\n\n\"Reinforced steel, this guns were made for killing. Unlucky for you, my Sacred Gear makes it so that I like to kill my enemies. Like so.\" Blaze stated as he fired his guns from their current position and shot the two closest goons that were cowering in fright of the raising bloodlust in their air between the two farely even opponents.\n\n\"Gah, my damn arm was shot you...\" The unlucky goon that survived the first shot managed to scxream out before he was shot through the head with another bullet. Blaze twistes his body to the right when Kalawarner made to stab him through the stomach with a second spear of light in her other hand.\n\n\"... How strong are you when compared to the other Fallen Angels in the city?\" Blaze asked the question roaring in his mind, since his pride wanted him to be the one fighting against the strongest of them. He wanted to crush the strongest of the strong under his foot, and this woman was strong.\n\n\"I am the least powerful among the group I am in. The pecking order goes me, and then Dohnaseek, above him is Mittelt, and at the top of our small group is Raynare. Of course we each have our own area where we are better than the others. Tell me Human, being the leader of the group makes you the strongest, so how well do you think your minions are doing right now when you are having trouble with... me?\" Kalawarner started out in confidence, before it was replaced with shock when she saw that it looked like Blaze couldn't help himself with how red his face was. He looked like he wanted to die from laughter, and yet he was barely holding it in. He pointed his gun and killed two men charging at him and killed them to calm himself down.\n\n\"Me? The strongest of my group, that is laughable. Like you, I am the weakest right now. Kyokan is much more powerful than I am right now, and my weapons barely do any damage to her hard skin. Naruto on the other hand is leagues ahead of both me and Kyokan when it comes to fighting, as young as small as he is, he is the true leader of our group. You made a mistake when you made him your enemy.\" Blaze stated clearly for her to hear, and he pointed his gun at her head and pulled the trigger... only to find out the gun was empty from his earlier target practice with these guns. It would seem that he forgot to reload them before reusing them, but pointing his second gun at a fleeing goon he shot him through the back of the neck and killed him rather quickly with the last bullet that gun had. Kalawarner on the other hand was going over the information that she had heard so far, and then she started to laugh despite the fact that she only had a smaller number of her goons left.\n\n\"HA! So the little pussy cat is the leader of your group, getting the Twilight Healing and you War God's Keen Eye will be easy. Maybe I should betray Raynare once I have your Sacred Gear, and then steal the Twilight Healing for myself. A Gear that makes use of all weapons, and a Gear that heals nearly all injuries. I won't just be unstoppable, but invincible!\" Kalawarner stated as the idea hit her, before something else hit her in the form of Blaze slamming his forehead into her nose and breaking it with his head. She grunted in pain as blood gushed out of her nostrels, before she stepped back and tried to slug Blaze in the face. He was about to reload his gun, before he leaned back and avoided a Spear of Light out of instinct. Yet, the attack cut lightly into hs chest, and knocked his ammo away from him by cutting it from his chest. It fell to the ground, and he reached down to his thigh and pulled out his dagger with one hand.\n\n\"I wouldn't call Naruto a pussy cat. True, most of the time he acts like a housecat, but in battle he awakens to his hunting instincts and become a true lion. A lion that should be feared as the powerful animal it is, and you little birds are just his next meal.\" Blaze taunted her in defence of his leader, before he jumped to the side and dodge a spear of light while he used his free hand to grab the swinging arm of one of the last few priests before the sword of light could hit him. Swinging his dagger, he cleany cut the head of the man attacking him off and spun around in time to react to another attack from the very last goon. He stabbed the man fatally in the chest, and he himself got a deep cut on his forearm. Wincing in pain, he yanked the dagger roughly out of the dead man's chest and looked at Kalawarner. She whistled lightly at the carnage, before she held her hands out and created two spears of light.\n\n\"Like I care what happens to my comrades, I originally became a Fallen Angel because I was sick of the peace of Heaven and killed my comrades. So long as I survive, I don't care what happens to those around me. As it turns out, killing an Angel is something that instantly puts you on the exiled list.\" Kalawarner replied to his earlier statement about how Naruot was the worst enemy for them to make. Blaze charged at her in anger of how she admitted to not caring about her comrades, killing a coward was one thing, but killing those that truly fight beside you was another thing completely. He swung at her head, and she blocked with one spear of light, before swinging her other one at him with impressive speed that outclasses what he was able to do at the moment. Either way, his body reacted on instinct given to him by his Sacred Gear and he jumped onto his hand and curled up to avoid the attack, before he fell to the ground when she kicked his arm out from under him.\n\n'She is faster and physically stronger than me, but I have better reaction time.' Blaze thought as he rolled over onto his stomach before the spears of light could impale his chest.\n\n\"You are holding back on me Human, you have two swords at your waist and have yet to draw them.\" Kalawarner states in distaste, while Blaze grimaced at how she noticed that he hadn't been using his two swords that he had taken into battle with him. He sheathed his dagger again, before he placed his hands on the handles of his two chosen blades. He slowly drew each blade, and he immediently felt a large drain on his energy reserves. The second the blades were free from their prison, the one on the started to glow white hot, witht he heat from the blade being felt by Kalawarner even from her spot in the room. The second sword had a blade that was completely made up of silver, and on the side of the blade was a cross shaped ingraving.\n\n\"These swords aren't meant for normal combat, while my Sacred Gear lets me use them despite them being Holy Swords, both of them naturally drain my reserves to full their special powers.\" Blaze explained as he charged at the woman in front of him and swung the silver sword first, and she blocked it with her spear of light for half of a second before it cut right through her own holy attack. She flapped her wings for a second, before she escaped as a line of fire appeared to follow behind the glowing white blade. Blaze remembered how he came across these swords, and truthfully it wasn't hard to find them. The hard part was the drain on his reserves, because he had actually had to activally fuel the fire and holy abilities of these blades. His Gear let him use them, but he needed to provide the fuel needed for their abilities to activate.\n\nHe started to move around faster as he started to cut through her second spear of light with his glowing sword.\n\n\"I knew it! Your Sacred Gear lets you use any weapon as long as your body can take it! Such a Sacred gear is wasted of a weak bodied human!\" Kalawarner shouted at him in clear amusement as she arried a blow from the slightly weaker heated sword as his reserves started to grow weaker from the constant drain of both Sacred Swords that he had found when his family had went on location to climb a mountain. The swords had called out to him for a reason, so sheathing the heat based sword the drain on his reserves slowed down, and he cut off the power to the Holy Sword of Silver so that his reserves would stop going down. Kalawarner shot a spear of light at him and he cut it in half so that both halfs wouldn't hit him before impaling in the wall. He cut through the three more thrown spears, and he started to move forward.\n\n\"I may be weaker than you... but I refuse to lose to you!\" Blaze yelled at her with a tone laced with anger, before he placed the Holy Sword back into the sheath. Then he placed both of his hands on the handles, before he channelled the rest of his trained energy into the souls of his feet and the palms of his hands.\n\n\"Ha! That Sacred Gear will be mine, so try your hardest and attempt to defeat me!\" Kalawarner yelled right back at him when a larger than before spear of light appeared in her right hand, and both of them vanished in a quick burst of speed.\n\n\"Holy Flame Cross Slash!\" Blaze stated as he appared first at the spot she had been standing before, and he was holding hist swords like a cross. One of them was glowing white hot again, while the other was shining with a light holy light to it. Neither of them were powerful Holy Swords on their own, and even together they weren't very powerful, but in the right hands they could be a force to be messed with.\n\nKalawarner appeared moments later on the ground, barely able to move as blood gushed out of her chets and stomach when a cross shaped slash appeared on her abdomen. She gacked up blood, before she covered her bleeding wounds with wings to slow down the bleeding. She then smirked when she heard a thud, and turned her head to see Blaze on the ground while holding onto his gut. Blood poured out of the large hole in his stomach, and his mouth was spewing out blood just like his stomach. His swords fell to the ground, and the human passed out from blood loss seconds later.\n\n\"Maybe you aren't as weak as I thought... Blaze Bolding, but you are just as dead as I said you would be. Fool, using Holy Swords of that level against a Fallen Angel. You would have been better off sticking to the dagger... huh?\" Kalawarner managed to say as she fell down as well when she felt herself going faint. She landed on her side, and just before she passed out as well she felt her chest and felt something sticking out. Yanking it out, she saw it was the very dagger she had been talking about meer moments before. Blood squirted out of her chest, right where her heart was as she bleed out slightly slower than Blaze. She closed her eyes and smirked lightly, and she heard the breathing of the man that had defeated her stop.\n\nBlaze Bolding was the first one dead, but she would admit that it was her loss this time. She had understimate him, and just because she was faster and stronger, she had thought that winning would be a simple matter.\n\nKalawarner died moments later with a smile on her face, matching the smile that was on Blaze's face.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Great Z Fighter OR Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t20. Chapter 20 Of Knights and Bishops\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'Hmmmm, so this is the what a normal human with the War God's Keen Eye is able to do. I have to admit that killing eleven Exiled Priests and a Fallen Angel is pretty impressive for a relativally normal human.' Rias thought as she and her second closest friend besides Naruto walked beside her and took in the carnage caused by one human with a slightly rare Sacred Gear. Akeno was looking on with a slightly impressive gaze at how this Blaze character was able to use magic at all, something that only humans that trained in magic formally were able to do these days. This already showed that he was impressive for a human, even if he was a human with a Sacred Gear.\n\n\"Ara ara, and as annoyed as I am to admit Kalawarner was not bad either. The two seemed to have come to an understanding near the end of the fight.\" Akeno stated with a hand in front of her mouth, while Rias placed a hand to her chin. She had originally just came to this place to help out Naruto and get him to come back and accept his punishment peacefully once the nun was safe, but then she had come across the sight of these two battling. She was impressed with what she saw, and if she had seen correctly then Blaze had made some sort of break through with his opponenyt near the end like Akeno had said. The two seemed to have a deep understanding of each other based on how they battled, and that understanding breed respect for both the Fallen Angel and the human.\n\n\"Bishop or Knight... Akeno, do you think that bringing back these two into my peerage would be a wise move. Normally I ask Naruto, but...\" Rias trailed off lightly. Honestly, people thought that she couldn't do anything without Naruto, just because she relied on him for nearly everything didn't mean that she wasn't capable on her own. These two were too impressive to allow to stay dead, and since Naruto wasn't able to reincarnate them then she would have to do it. Blaze might not have agreed to becoming her Knight originally, but now that he was dead all bets were off. It was first come, first serve, and she thought to herself that she would be a little bit better as a King to this kind of person than Sona would be if she got her hands on him.\n\n\"Two... so you inculde the Fallen Angel. The boy would be a wise move, but the Fallen Angel is not a very wise choice. You can't trust Fallen Angels if you can't control them, so I say leave her dead. Naruto would like to have his friend back though.\" Akeno stated clearly... very clearly it would seem on her opinion of bringing back Kalawarner into Rias' peerage. Rias on the other hand was not as clear on the matter, because what Naruto had said earlier to her was starting to sink in about how what side you were on truly didn't matter in the end. Reaching into her skirt pocket, she pulled out both the Knight piece she had remaining, AND the Bishop piece that was left in her collection of Evil Pieces. Akeno sighed lightly when she figured out that Rias was going to go through with it anyway, because it would seem that like Naruto she was stubborn about things that she wanted.\n\n\"I will just have this boy and Naruto control her then, if she respects Blaze then she might follow his lead. This boy follows Naruto, which means that Kalawarner will follow Naruto... and Naruto follows me. In the end, that means that she will listen to me if I play my cards right. You saw the fight, she will come in handy in the future Rating Game against Riser. Her Holy Element will prove to be a great asset to defeating Riser and his peerage of devils.\" Rias hinted at the bigger picture, and while Akeno agreed that from a base vew point it was a good plan, there were no promises that Kalawarner would listen to them. Then when Rias crossed her arms under her chest and smiled lightly, Akeno looked at her strangely. \"Not to mention, that it would be disappointing if this fight didn't get a round two. I think that both of these War Mongers would be grateful for me giving them the chance to fight more and more.\" Rias concluded a point that Akeno couldn't go against, because frankly it was true. These two were war lovers all the way to their core, and being brought back to life for the chance to fight another day would make both of them pretty grateful to Rias.\n\n\"You are stubborn about this... like pet like owner. Naruto totally got his rebellion streak from you. Are you sure about using the Bishop on Kalawarner though, you might need that for somebody else in the future. Why not use one of your Pawns?\" Akeno questioned, and Rias mentally did the math on which choice would be better for her. It wasn't much of a choice, while the Bishop would give Kalawarner larger reserves for use, they still couldn't trust her enough to have the Promotion ability of a Pawn at her disposal. Larger reserves wouldn't make her that much stronger than before unless she trained her ass of, while if she ever promotes to a Queen or Rook for awhile she would have enough power to betray them at her will. This way, she would get stronger, but at a rate they could manage and control.\n\n\"After this I will only have five Pawns left until a complete peerage. If I waste them on her, then she may take up more than one. That would put the total number of people in my peerage at a smaller number. This way, I can still gain either up to five more people.\" Rias said in a rather reasonable way for Akeno to mull over. She was right, but Akeno did not have to like the fact that an enemy was about to become an ally. Akeno nodded very lightly as a large magic circle appeared on the ground in the middle of the room, and knowing what Rias wanted she picked up Blaze and moved him to the middle of the circle. Instead of the normal transportation circle, this one was made to react with Evil Pieces and dead people so that they could turn them into Devils or Devil Hybrids. This was required when you turned somebody that wasn't a devil and made them a member of your peerage.\n\n'This is still a very bad decision... but this is what Naruto would do. He would make his enemies his friends, or at least try to if possible. I guess he rubbed off on Rias a bit more than she thinks he did. Normally she wouldn't even consider turning one of those kind into her servant.' Akeno thought as the Knight piece started to float in between Rias' hands, while the very same piece started to glow brightly.\n\n\"I command thee, Blaze Bolding, on my name Rias Gremory, become my servant and once more return thy soul to this land and become a devil.\" Rias started the chant to revive the dead and turn them into devils, and the Evil Piece started to float down down to the dead man. Rias had made sure to heal his body up as much as possible before she started the entire process, and instead of a hole going all the way through his body, now he was just going to have to deal with a big gash on his gut. She sent a look to Akeno, and the girl nodded and begun to heal the fallen Fallen Angel of the worst of her wounds. \"Thy will lead a great new life as my Knight!\" Rias finished the incantation as the piece entered the guy's body and vanished without a trace, and it took a few seconds before any affect was shown.\n\n\"Gaaaah! What the hell!? The the FUCKING hell!?\" Blaze shouted as he sat up and held his gut in pain, the very first thing he experienced being the agonizing pain in his gut at being returned to the land of the living. Blaze then blinked a few times and adjusted to the pain of having his gut in pain, before he realized something strange. That strange thing being that he was alive, when seconds ago he had been killed during his fight against Kalawarner.\n\n\"I brou-\" Rias began before she was knocked from her feet and onto her butt with a painful stinging in her cheek, and she looked at Blaze in shock for a few moments when she saw that his fist was extended. Akeno was looking at the entire scene with some amusement in her eyes, before they watched Blaze stand up and dust his pants off.\n\n\"I already figured it out, you brought me back as a Devil. Sorry, but I only listen to Naruto's orders. That was for bringing me back without my permission by the way, only Naruto was suppose to turn me into a Devil.\" Blaze stated with a sarcastic tone of voice, while Rias sighed at the attitude this one had. She should have figured that she would get punched for bringing him back like this, before she stood up and rubbed her cheek.\n\n\"I figured that you would want another shot at helping out Naruto, as his comrade in arms. Now you have that chance, and once Naruto becomes a High Class Devil I swear on my honor as Rias Gremory that I will trade you to him if that is what he wants. Devils are allowed to trade their pieces to each other, so just consider me your temporary general or something until Naruto gets his own Evil Pieces.\" Rias tried to reason with the war loving ex-human, before she saw him go over to where his Holy Swords were and look at them with his now reactive Sacred Gear. Rias herself was wondering if he was going to be able to touch them, and she nodded when she saw him place each hand on the blades before picking them up and giving them a test swing.\n\nThat was the good thing about Evil Pieces, if you reincarnated a human with the ability to use Holy Swords then they would keep that ability when they became devils. The fact his Sacred Gear gave him the ability to use all types of weapons was just a bonus.\n\n\"I will hold you to that, but I still won't listen to you. You haven't earned my respect yet, so don't expect me to follow your orders. Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to go kick some ass.\" Blaze stated as he sheathed his swords and made his way out of the broken door, before he noticed that Akeno was healimng the body of the person that killed him and stopped with a grin on his face. Turning to Rias, he pointed to Kalawarner with with his left thumb and grinned. \"Tell her that I look forward to round two, she was a good warm up.\" Blaze stated as he started to walk out of the room again with a purpose in his step.\n\n\"Just got revived, and he is already going back to the fighting despite having a gash in his gut. He is either very arrogant, or that brave... both.\" Akeno muttered lightly as she finished healing the worst of the damage to the Fallen Angels body before she picked the woman up and moved her over to the same circle that had been used for Blaze.\n\n\"He is a fool, but he is an honorable fool. He doesn't even seem to hate Kalawarner for killing him, I see why Naruto is friends with him. He is very straight forward with what he wants, and is determined to follow his leader to hell if it is needed. He is already well trained as well, the speed boost from being a Knight will make him a great asset indeed.\" Rias commented as she stepped near the dead body of the Fallen Angel and held out her Bishop piece. She was getting two very good pieces to her collection today, so even though Naruto was rebelling against her by saving the life of a nun, she had to admit that she was the one coming out on top. Sometimes it was nice to be King, even more so when you knew your peerage well enough to be able to use their actions to her advantage.\n\nOf course, she hadn't stopped Blaze from dying in the first place because she wasn't allowed to for the most part. She wasn't the type to take advantage of death, but if she had interfered with his fight then more problems would arrise out of her actions. Sometimes the best way to save a life was to have that life die first.\n\n\"I command thee, Fallen Angel Kalawarner, on my name Rias Gremory, return thy soul to this land and become a devil. Thy will lead a great new life as my Bishop!\" Rias chanted as she started to turning process for the Fallen Angel with the Bishop piece floating down and entering her chest as well, but un like with Blaze she was surprised when the feathers on one of Kalawarner's wings started to fall off and the wing itself chance shape into a devil wing. While this was happening her other wing stayed the exact same, and the two heard a groan before Kalawarner started to sit up and open her eyes.\n\n\"... Heh, how disgusting that I was saved by a little devil girl... I guess I shouldn't be talking now should I.\" Kalawarner stated as she started to stand up, and looked at her new wing style for a moment before bringing them both back into her body without trouble. Stretching her neck out, she found that being dead had made her a bit stiff. Looking at Rias, she gave the red haired King a deadpan look. \"For the record, I don't owe you anything. Now that I can't return to the Fallen Angels, you are the only place I can go. I still will, and will always, dislike devils... but seeing that now I am at least half devil I guess I will join you. Not like I have anything better to do.\" Kalawarner stated in a deadpan, yet truthfull tone. Honestly, while she wasn't happy about being a devil hybrid, at least she was alive again. Akeno was looking at Kalawarner in distrust, ready to kill her again at a moments notice, while Rias smirked lightly.\n\n\"I don't like Fallen Angels either, nor Angels for that matter, BUT if you follow me I won't consider you either of them. You are now the Bishop of Rias Gremory, and as long as you are loyal to me then you will be treated like family... if you hurt even one of my friends though I will kill you without hesitation though.\" Rias threated with a smile on her face, and a redish black aura around her body that seemed to leak out with a sinister kill lust that far surpassed that of Kalawarner. The Devil/Fallen Angel nodded lightly, before she looked around at the dead bodies on the ground and noticed that Blaze wasn't there.\n\n'Interesting, so it would seem that I get to have a rematch with him... I look forward to seeing what you can do now with a Devil body Blaze. It should be very exciting.' Kalawarner though with a smirk on her face.\n\n\"Come on Akeno, we are going to see if Naruto needs any help.\" Rias stated as she started to walk out of the house with Akeno behind her. Of course, just because she was going to help Naruto now, doesn't mean that she was going to punish him for almost starting a war later. She had finally decided on what she wanted to do for her way to punish Naruto.\n\nSuffice to say, he was going to learn that risking war would not be tolerated.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Poll Status: Complete**_  \n_**63 Votes - All of the Choices (Go to profile to see Choices)**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Strange Mage**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\nFan letter to Blaze the 'Suit-up Weapon Armory'  \n\"What type of weapons do prefer to use more often?\"\n\n\"I love all weapon types equally.\" Blaze stated simply.\n\n\n\t21. Chapter 21 The Hell Cat's Eyes\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Hmm, so Kalawarner is dead it would seem. Raynare will not be pleased, but neither will she be upset. Kalawarner seems to have defeated her opponent as well, so it all evens out.\" A middle aged man wearing a fedora and trenchcoat stated as he floated in the air above the city with his black wings coming out of his back. This was Dohnaseek, one of the Fallen Angels that were currently after Asia's Sacred Gear, and right at this moment he was using a hand held radio to report the current locations and direction changes of the ones that were currently protecting thier goal. Right now his eyes were scanning the forest to attempt to try and find the giant woman and the small teenage girl that were trying to hide from his keen eyes. He had already reported to the others that Kalawarner was dead, which was fine by him. She was the weakest of them, with himself and being much stronger than her.\n\n[Dohnaseek, which direction are they going?] The voice on the hand held asked with a feminine tone to her voice, and a very light amount of happy humor hidden inside it. He held the radio to his mouth, before pressing the button that would allow him to talk.\n\n\"I am unable to find them right now, they are in the Eastern most woods outside of the city limits though. The target only has the large one for protection, gather everyone and tell them to launch a full as- WHAT!?\" Dohnaseek shouted when he noticed that something large and fast was flying right at him, so with a flap of his wings he was barely able to dodge as a tree... a tree? Yes, it would seem that he had just barely avoided by killed by a flying tree. His eyes went back to the ground to try and find the source of the tree, before his eyes widened when he flew away again when he noticed a HUGE chunk of rock heading towards him.\n\n[What is going on over there!?] The voice on the radio shouted, and he wasn't able to respond before he needed to make some quick airial moves to avoid as two trees flew at him and nearly ripped his wings out of his back. He grit his teeth, before he began to make his descent towards the ground. He knew when to stay out of the air, and when somebody was in the woods throwing trees at you then you had to get the hell out of the sky before you were killed by a flying tree or rock.\n\n\"Send everyone to to the Eastern Woods, we have the location of the target.\" Dohnaseek ordered into the radio, before he heard the sound of static over the radio. He looked almost concerned for a brief moment, before he turned it on and tried to listen in to what was being said to him.\n\n[Can't... being... by... cat... sing!... end... lp] The voice said before all that wa sheard was static, and his eyes widened when he was able tp figure out what was being said over the radio.\n\nCan't help you, being attacked by the cat! Send Help!\n\n**[With Naruto]**\n\n\"So this is where you were nya!\" Naruto shouted as he jumped down into a whole group of Stray Priests with nothing in his hands but his claws. Naruto landed on the ground right in front of the priests, and standing behind them was the small female Fallen Angel that Naruto had seen talking on the walkie talkie earlier. She had wild blonde hair that was wrapped up in a black bow in the back, and she wore a frilly black and white dree over her body that hyad a short skirt at the end. Her blue eyes stuck out to him in the dark night, and she was looking at him with a look on annoyance. She was only a few inches taller than Naruto himself, and the two stared at each other for a few moments before she smirked at him.\n\n\"Looking for little old me, well sorry to disaapoint, but I am not Raynare-sama. My name is Mittelt, the last name you will ever learn Devil-kun... or is it Kitten-kun. Yes, that seems to fit you better.\" Mittelt stated with a superior smirk on her face, not knowing that she was pushing all the wrong buttons with the way that she was refering to Naruto. From his friends these kinds of things were okay, but from an enemy he was NOT about to be considered a little kitten. Naruto was here to end this anyway, because if ALL of the Fallen Angels in the city were killed then there would be nobody to go after Asia. That was the best bet to make sure that Asia was safe from these murderous fiends. Her eyes showed that she was waiting for him to make the first move before she gave her minions the orders to take care of him, and Naruto estimated that there were at least thirty of them in front of him.\n\nThe claws on Naruto's right hand extended to a few inches long, before he sped towards the opponents and slashed with his right clawed hand at the front row of priests much like how a cat would claw at somebody. Naruto's claws completely destroyed their efforts to block the attack, slicing through the swords of light with very little effort. His attack didn't hurt them, but every single priest was stunned when their swords and sword handles were all shattered by the attack, even those that weren't even close by when the attack had been made had their weapons destroyed. Naruto jumped up into the air, and before anyone could react he took in a deep breath of air with his chest starting to puff up lightly from the large intake of the much needed source of power for his next attack. He was NOT here to play around, he was going to kill them all and make his way towards the next Fallen Angel. Naruto's cheeks puffed up when he had the right amount of air inside him for the technique he was about to pull off.\n\n\"Youjutsu: Rodent Hairball!\" Naruto yelled out the name of the technique that had come to him during a dream, and out of his mouth came a large blue rat made of blue flames. The rat was about two feet long, and a foot tall as it soared towards the ground. Yet, this attack never touched the ground because in mid air the rat exploded into dozens of smaller blue flaming mice.\n\n\"Get out of the way you fools!\" Mittelt shouted out her order, and most of the priests started to run away from the technique. Yet, in the air Naruto smirked when his blue mice ecploded again and ,multiplied once more, but now each mouse was starting to go straight towards a priest. No matter hjow fast or far the priests managed to run, the mice were now literally chansing after them like they were homing in on them. Naruto landed on the ground in front of them to cut their way of escaping off, before he sent a mental command to every single mouse to explode witht eh same force as a grenade. The priests that were caught in the flaming blue explosions was completely defeated by the sheer heat behind the attacks, leaving ONLY their burnt skeletons behind as proof that they existed. There deaths were both quick and amazingly painful for that brief second their flesh was burned from their bodies.\n\n'Half of them are still left... and angry it would seem.' Naruto thought as the priests that were sending him the killing intent started to charge at him with whatever they could get their hands on at the time. It would seem that their anger and hatred of devils, and the fact that he killed their comrades had blinded them to reason. Naruto tilted his head to the right to avoid getting hit by the remains of a light sword, before he elbowed the man that sent the attack in the gut hard enough to send him flying into the group of men attacking him. Mittelt was actually using this as her chance to try and see how strong Naruto was, and to see if she could find any weak points in his defence. Naruto seemingly smirked for a brief second, before his eyes grew cold when he remembered that this woman was trying to kill a girl like Asia. Clapping his hands together for half a second, he split his hands apart to show five clear bubbles between his palms. Each was no bigger than a four inches in diameter, but the way they glowed was more than enough to put those that noticed it on edge.\n\n\"Pop those bubbles you morons, or do you all want to see what they can do?\" Mittelt asked sarcastically, not really caring what happened to the minions. They were EASILY replacable after all, meaning that she could get more of them if she wanted to later.\n\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you nya.\" Naruto stated as he sent the bubbles up into the air around the battle field, before he jumped out of the way of his own attack radius when he snapped his fingers and the bubbles started to fill themselves up with a purplish pin liquad. Naruto snapped his fingers again and the bubbles popped before the others could react, and while Mittelt was able to react in the split second that his attack had need to form, the others were not as lucky when his bubbles popped and it started to rain acid from the sky.\n\n\"Ahhhhh!\"  \n\"It BURNS!\"  \n\"Save us Mittelt-sama!\"\n\nThe bodies of the men were quickly disolved into nothing but scraps of metal from the broken swords they were carrying, with nothing but that to show that they even existed in the first place. These were another of his Youjutsu Techniques that he had spent much of his past free times inventing and perfecting in a way, the bubbles would be created, before they would be used to convert energy into the type of element that they had been created to store. Then once they were full of the element, they would pop and release the element inside with one huge burst of power that scattered the element across the battlefield. He could shower people with rocks, fire, ice, water, acid, lightning, or almost anything that he had a bubble for. It was hard to avoid for humans, not when the pain was completely unbearable when you were hit with one drop of powerful acid.\n\n\"Nekoshou are masters of Youjutsu... the second you decided to fight me with your power you were promised death. Bubbles may seem harmless, but in the right hands they are a weapon that can not be understimate... not to say that it is my only style of Youjutsu. I have a few more up my sleeve, like my... Twin Tailed Fireball nya!\" Naruto shouted at the end of his small speech as he spat out a small blue fireball with two tails of red flame, and two cat ears on the top of it made of orange flame following, behind the blue blaze of power and destruction, and as Mittlet flew over the attack she noticed that it grew larger and larger as it destroyed dozens of trees behind her in seconds before fading away into nothing after taking out a good portion of the surrounding area, leaving behind scourched grass and earth.\n\n\"Power means nothing if you can't hit me you lowly-\" Mittelt started out before she was sent from the sky, and crahsing into the ground when Naruto appeared above her and kicked her right in the face faster than she coujld even react to his attack. Both of speed of the Knight, and the strength of the Rook were put to good use as he broke her cheek and chin from the awe inspirong power behind his speedy attack. His bat wings coming out of his lower back and allowing him to float in the air above the downed Fallen Angel.\n\n\"I am the STRONGEST member of the peerage of Rias Gremory, the woman that will become the greatest head that the Gremory will ever know! I am the QUEEN of her peerage, so save your lectures for somebody that cares. I was trained by Kuroka the Black Cat, one of the strongest Nekoshou to be born in the last 1,000 years NYA! The proud blood of my race runs thick in my veins and the strength given to me by Rias flows through my body, if you call me lowly then you call my family and friends lowly!\" Naruto shouted in anger when he took her words as the final push to actually start showing off his held back killing intent, and while he normally was a very calm and collected person when it came to battle, if you insulted his friends or family then he would turn from a kitten into a lion that would rend asunder those that dared to lay watse to the good names of his cherished ones. The blood in his veins was shared with him by his sister, and he was born from a race that had the ability to master Senjutsu and Youjutsu to a level that almost no other race could. He took pride in that fact, because among the Youkai there were few races that could prove a good challenge to a Nekoshou that had mastered their races arts.\n\nThe power of the Queen that had been given to him by Rias had just made him stronger, faster, and increased his reserves to levels that were hard to match by even the other members of her peerage. His small size only condensed that power and speed to higher levels, and with his greater reserves his potential for Senjutsu and Youjutsu had only been increased to amazing levels that surpassed that of his sister's potential. From birth he was born with amazing reserves, and with them enhanced that only made the potential he had only greater than what it was before.\n\nThis little Fallen Angel with only one set of wings could never hope to reach the power that he held deep within him, and the sheer force that he currently had at his disposal. He only hit her once with barely any of his power, and she looked like she had been defeated by his single attack he had hit her with. He didn't even need to try, and he had attacks that could have wiped out the entire group with one fell swoop as well as the Fallen Angel, but then he would have a source of information on something that he had been trying to find out.\n\nThat was why wehn he picked her up from the ground, he ignored the fact that her clothes had been shredded from the shockwaves of his last attack, and the fact that her nipples were showing as he held the slightly taller girl up into the air by her neck. She jolted into an alert mode, before she realized that she was having an extreme amount of trouble breathing. She managed to summon pink Spear of Light in her hand, and just as she thrust it forward she was surprised when Naruto simple grabbed her wrist and snapped it before the attack could touch him, and since she had been thro0ugh more painful things before this point she didn't scream, but the look of pain on her face was easy to see for Naruto. She brought up her hand to her face, and in a small flash of light she had a radio in her hand.\n\n\"Can't... being... by... cat... sing!... end... lp!\" She managed to say into the radio, before it was destroyed by Naruto's fist as he punched the mechanical device with his free hand. He looked at her with pity for a brief moment, because frankly, even if these people were enemies he didn't like killing others, but he knew that people that would so coldly try and kill such a nice girl like Asia did not deserve his pity when they faced death.\n\n\"Youjutsu: Nekoshou Evil Eye.\" Naruto chanted the name of his next move as both of his eyes turnbed a startling blue color, and the Fallen Angel's eyes grew dull as she fell under his illusion, and her struggling body became completely limp with no more struggle even attempting to be made.\n\n**-Inside the Illusion- (Play Music) Jaaku no Tsuchi Oto**\n\n\"Where... where am I?\" Mittelt asked herself as she looked around to see that she was in a place where she had never been before. Frankly, it looked like a dead forest filled with thousands of creepy looking trees. She looked down at herself when she tried to move her body, only to see that she was completely naked. Her eyes widened, and she found that it was impossible to cover herself up when she was unable to move even a single muscle.\n\n\"It is pointless, only those with impressive raw power, or strong willpower can escape this technique of mine.\" The voice of Naruto stated as the ground in front of her began to morph and buldge as it took shape and started to gain color before finally turning into Naruto himself, yet his eyes were still blue. Mittelt was about to argue, before Naruto glared at her and she was frozen in fear of the smaller boy. He smirked at her reaction for a moment, before he frowned. \"I can't believe that you will be the first person to see this... I originally made this to defeat a fool anem Riser Phenex... a Phoenix can heal from nearly any physical wound to a certain degree... but that healing doesn't extend to the mind nya.\" Naruto explained vaguely to the confused girl, and that was as far as he went with the description of his technique.\n\nThis was not only a form of Illusion Youjutsu, but also a Devil Magic that allowed one to read minds. By combining the two Naruto was able to place an illusion inside the mind of his opponent, and then read the illusion so that he could place himself inside it and torture his opponent inside their own mind. Of course, it wasn't unbeatable, because if he couldn't gain entry to the mind it would fail, but he could also be forced out of their mind by a powerful force, or if they were disturbed in real life. If Mittelts body was disturbed in real life, then the technique would be ended and they would both be forced to the real world. Not to mention that against opponents with other beings inside them it was nearly useless, and would simply fail the second he tried to use it. It was a double edged sword that he would only use when Riser had nobody left in his peerage to defend him or shock him while they were in his mind.\n\nActually, the best part was that this attack was unique to ONLY Naruto, and it couldn't be taught to others besides his children, because the base of the attack was Naruto's own Empathy Abilities... yes, Naruto was able to turn his emotion sensing power into a form of attack against his opponents mind and emotions, turning his strength and weakness into a form of attack that few could truly defend against. Nobody else was able to use this, because if they were a Nekoshou/Devil Hybrid with Epmpathy Abilities then they wouldn't be able to use the attack, which meant that this was a Naruto-Unique attack that only possibly his children could learn one day... maybe.\n\nMittelt started to try and struggle against his control when the ground around her started to slowly pull her under, and shooting pain went through her entire body as the burning of thousands of fire ant bites pierced and hurt her slowly.\n\n\"You WILL tell me everything you know, or you will break nya.\" Naruto stated simply as her eyes widened in horror, only for his now blue eyes to not give her an inch.\n\nShe would tell him what she knew, or he would break her in the process of getting his answers.\n\nWhen Naruto made a promise to protect somebody, then he would turn his own heart cold and do what must be done to protect what he wanted to protect... no matter how much sorrow it caused him in the process. Don't get him wrong either, he honestly did hate having to do this to anyone... except maybe that bastard and Riser, but against Riser it was literally the best way to defeat him, and against the bastard he wanted to kill... he just wanted to cause that rapist filth as much pain as possible before killing him.\n\nThe killer instincts of a cat were not to be messed with, no matter how nice that cat is.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Great Overlord (Then) Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t22. Chapter 22 The Broken\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Please... I beg you... we have been at this for hours... just make... it end... please.\" Mittelt pleaded with Naruto on her knees in her own mind, her clothes were completely gone from her body and thousands of slash marks littered her body. Because of this was her own mind no matter what he did to her mental body, she would never die from it, but she would always feel the pain from it. All of the cuts on her body healed up right away at a mental command from Naruto, before tree roots wrapped around her body and ripped her to shreds of flesh and bone. She screamed at the top of her lungs at being ripped apart, before her flesh crawled together again and she reformed from the battered flesh.\n\n\"Did you know that in dreams the perception of time is much slower, and right now this Illusion acts much like a dream.\" Naruto stated as a look of horror appeared on Mittelts face when she realized what was happening, and frankly, she was scared to know how much time had passed outside of her own head. Naruto didn't smirk, nor did he even crack a smile when she looked at him like he was the boogeyman that lurked in the night. He knew that she had figured it out, and with nobody outside her mind to break her out of the Illusion she could be in here for weeks. \"Yes, it seems you have figured it out... it has only been five minutes in the real world. Every minutes that passes in the real world, equals three hours in the world of this Illusion. We have been here for 15 hours straight... all your men are dead, and right now you only have two Fallen Angels that are alive last I checked. They have most likely written you off as dead by now, so nobody will save you.\" Naruto explained to situation to help further along mentally breaking her as well.\n\n\"... I submit... just make the pain end.\" Mittelt finally said when the situation finally set in. She had no escape, and this person was so much stronger than her that she had no chance against him in real life as well. She was truly at his mercy in every way possible, and there was nothing she could think of that could save her. She had already tried using her own imagination, but it would seem that even in her own mind the only thing that she could imagine was this monster in cute flesh having unlimited power over her. She had been utterly dominated in the real world, so even now she could only imagine him as a monster that she couldn't stand up against. No matter what she tried to do, she had no power even in her own mind over him.\n\nMittelt had been broken.\n\nShe didn't even try to attack him when she was given the ability to move again, and a chari appeared behind her. In a bigger show of how broke she was at the moment, she didn't even attempt to sit in the chair, only falling to her knees in a show of complete submission before him. Naruto formed a chair behind him, and he sat down and held his hand out for Mittelt to take, and like a lost puppy she took his hand into her's and pressed her lips very softly to the hand of the Nekoshou in front of her. She lathered his hand in small kisses, and Naruto finally smirked lightly, before he took his hand from her and nodded in approval. He was kind of glad that he would have to kill her yet, at least as long as she didn't try and betray him and hurt somebody he cared about. That was the biggest reason that the one named Raynare was going to die, she had not only killed Issei the first time, but she had set her sights on Asia. That was an instant death sentence, and the last he had sensed the other Fallen Angel that had arrived at Blaze's house had been killed with Blaze at the same time as well.\n\nNaruto had nearly freaked out at that, before he felt Blaze and the Fallen Angel get restored and tainted by the aura of a devil. The only one he knew, besides Sona that is, that had the power to bring the dead back to life was Rias. Of course, he would be both annoyed that she brought them both back as devils, which was a dumb move on her part, but he was happy that Blaze was still alive in a way. It was sort of a bitter feeling.\n\n\"Now Mittelt, tell me everything about Raynare's plans and other allies. I want to know her strengths, her weaknesses, and the best way to take her down.\" Naruto ordered with his fingers laced, and the girl nodded very slightly with a small amount of hesitation. Naruot could see the doubt about her current path on her eyes, and frankly so long as his friends were in danger he couldn't care less that he was asking Mittelt to betray her allies and become a traitor to her people.\n\n\"I... understand. Raynare-sama... I mean Raynare has only one other ally besides myself, Kalawarner, and Dohnaseek. There is a very demented ex-priest named Freed that loves killing everything in his path, and Raynare plans on impressing our old masters by collecting the Twilight Healing and using it to become very powerful. Her strengths are seduction and lying, while her weakness is that she may have power, but she isn't naturally a frontal fighter.\" Mittelt stated with a look that said that she was still conflicted about giving Naruto this information, but she didn't wantt o get tortured again. She would tell Raynare to go to hell if it meant that she would never have to experience this kind of hell again, so basically she was saying goodbye to her old life the second she made herself aware that the only way to live through this was to submit to Naruto.\n\n\"She isn't very smart either... she did throw away the Boosted Gear after all.\" Naruto stated much to Mittelt's surprise at that little bit of information, but most people would be surprised to learn that your ex-leader was dumb enough to throw away one of the 13 Sacred Gears that were said to be able to give the user the strength to kill a god. Maybe changing teams at this point would be more than just a bid for survival, maybe it was literally her ONLY way to survive, because she didn't see Raynare living much longer if she had thrown away such a valuable Sacred Gear. That was almost as bad as outright killing a person with a Sacred Gear while inside the territoy of a devil that was known to be able to reincarnate people, which would just give the devils a new devil with a Sacred Gear... something that she was sure that Raynare would have done if it wasn't suggested that they start stealing Sacred Gears instead of just killing the owner so they weren't a threat.\n\nMittelt blinked when the world around her faded away, and she was bad in the destroyed forest where she had been defeated in the real world by Naruto, while Naruto was standing in front of her with his eyes gone back from blue to yellow. She blinked in surprise at being back in the real world, before she got on her knees and bowed to Naruto to retain a position of obedience so that he didn't blow her up right away now that he had no more apparent use for her. Naruto hummed lightly as a wicked plan started to from in his head, before he grinned lightly and started to laugh. Oh yes, he would be sure to make sure that Raynare knew just who she was messing with, and that pissing him off was one of the dumbest things a person could do. Piss of a ct, and the claws WILL come out.\n\n\"Say... how would you like to continue living?\" Naruto asked rather sarcatically of the Fallen Angel, and he turned his back and started to walk away very slowly to give her a chance to think up a responce... one that didn't take very long to think up, so when she gasped at being given a chance to live that was all the answer that Naruto needed to give out his idea. \"I figured as much, if you want to live then from now on you are to dedicate your life as... my future Pawn. Your first task... take me to Raynare.\" Naruto said with his wicked grin still in place.\n\nKyokan was going to be taking the position of his Rook, with her already amazing strength and durability, being a Rook would boost that to almost unheard of levels. Blaze was already turned into something, so Naruto would have to trade Rias for him at some point, but Naruto suspected that Rias used her Knight on Blaze to take advantage of his weapon mastery abilities. The Knight and the Rook were only 2 pieces out of 15 that he would one day be able to use, which left him with 13 that he would have to pick on how to use.\n\nHe would have his Queen, one Rook, one Knight, two Bishops, and eight Pawns left even after he got his two friends into his group through different methods. That was a good number of spots to fill... even though he already had a Bishop he wanted to ask about joining him. Now that he thought about it, if he got a Evil Piece Set then he would have a Queen piece... since trading was possible, he wondered if it was possible to trade his Queen piece to Rias for himself. Then he would be able to go against Rias in a Rating Game, because he was being honest with himself when he said that Rias was one of the people that he wanted to fight the most, and he wasn't thinking that because he hated her or anything, just that she was stronger than she was given credit for. He wanted to fight against that strength of hers just because he simply loved fighting against strong opponents... of course he seriously doubted the Rias would be willing to trade HIM of all people.\n\n\"I will do as you say... Naruto-sama.\" Mittelt regretefully said when her self-preservation instincts told her that this really was her only option, and she did NOT want to die today because her pride as a Fallen Angel was telling her to try and attack this guy while his back was turned. She was seriously tempted to try something, but then her men tal breaking kicked in again and she viewed her own death by his hands at the meer thought of trying to stab him in the back. Every back stabbing thought only ended up with her picturing one of the literally hundreds of ways he had killed her inside her own mind would be pictured, and the pain that came with death would shatter the will it took for her to try and attempt to betray him.\n\n\"Very good, because you are going to be delivering... Asia to Raynare just as planned nya.\" Naruto stated with a small grin on his face as his features started to change. Naruto grew taller and his frame shifted into a more feminine shape. Mittelt watched in shock at the high level magic being used to make a carbon copy of Asia Argento right in front of her. Naruto's white hair turned blonde and grew out to the same style and length as Asia's hair. The very texture of the hair was percectly imitated, while Naruto's tanned skin grew paler until it perfectly matched up with Asia's. Naruto had finally stopped getting taller when he reached Asia's height, and his frame had stopped changing when his body type became a perfect match for Asia's body type. Naruto looked down for a moment and then concentrated on some other aspects of Asia to change, like her well sized breasts and hips. Asia might not have breasts as big as Rias or Akeno, but she was still well endowed for a human girl her age.\n\nThis was Naruto's own form of Transformation Magic using since he SUCKED at using the Devil form of Transformation, so instead he created his own method by using Youjutsu. His version was beter in the way that it made him the perfect copy of his target... sadly though, he had to know the targets body to be able to get it right, and his imagination had to fill in areas that he had no clue about. Thankfully, he had walked in on Asia in the shower without her noticing once, which gave him a great view for the split second he had stayed inside the room with her. That split second had been ingraved into his memory.\n\nWhen the Transformation Youjutsu was finished there stood in Naruto's place the near perfect image of Asia Argento, with the only issue being that she was wearing Naruto's clothes... that were slioghtly tight on the taller girl's frame. Naruto placed an annoyed look on Asia's face that just didn't seem to belong there at how uncomfy his own clothes were now that he had given himself the perfect copy of Asia's body. This was another thing that he disliked about his own Youjutsu, it couldn't be used to change clothes. Naruto grunted and was pleased to see that his strength was still working as he ripped of the first layer of the tight clothes, and now the Asia copy was only wearing a tank top and a pair of cat paw themes boxers.\n\nThe image was actually really sexy to see a scantily clad Asia wearing Naruto's now not as tight clothes, with the boxers being strained more than the top thanks to the size of her hips, and the top was only to tight around the chest thanks to her breast size.\n\n'Raynare... is like going to fall right into this trap.' Mittelt thought in surprise at how well the transformtion was done, and she watched as Naruto looked himself... herself... it was hard to say because there was NO bulge on the front of the boxers. It was only a transformation so Naruto was still the same person, but he was using a female body that belonged to a rather feminine girl. She had no idea what gender to place Naruto as at this moment, something that seriously annoyed her when she realized that Naruto would be so much better at cosplay than she ever was.\n\n\"Oh the irony, the form that will be the downfall of the Fallen Angel after Asia will be Asia's form itself.\" Naruto stated as he checked the body over one more time to make sure that everything was perfect, if he didn't do this a few times it was possible he would miss out on a small detail that would give him away. He grabbed the sides of Asia's hips and found them to be the right size, before moving his hands to the form's stomach and noticing the first flaw her had made. Correcting the mistake right away, he placed a little less muscle tone in Asia's stomach, because unlike him she didn't have nearly as much muscle tone. It was mistakes like this that Naruto always made sure that he did double checks to make sure to get the things he missed.\n\nNaruto held his... her... Asia's slim hand out and summoned forth a small magic circle, befor ehte magic circle started to glow and become reflective like a mirror. Naruto made the mirror circle float in front of Asia's face and check out the work that he did this time. The very first thing he noticed was that he would have to change his eye color from his own into Asia's, a mistake he corrected right away. Narrowing the eyes he was using, Naruto noticed VERY thin whisker marks that most peope wouldn't have noticed at first glance. With a sigh, the whisker marks vanished without a trace for moments before.\n\nThis was something that he always had trouble getting rid of, the whisker marks that always seemed to have the desire all on their own to stay on his face. It took more effort to make them go away, but he could do it. Kuroka didn't have... actually, when he had tried to teach Kuroka this skill they had both found out that she could do it. No matter how hard she tried, for Kuroka it wasn't the same as his. When Naruto used it, his entire body changed, when Kuroka used it her body sort of changed, but she needed to constantly fuel the technique. Naruto only had to use energy to make the change, but after making the change he had learned that he could stay in whatever form he liked for as long as possible. He didn't need to constantly fuel the technique like others needed to do with other Transformation techniques.\n\nIf he wanted to, he could change anything he wanted about himself and keep the change for as long as he wanted to. Size, shape, or even gender meant nothing to him, but he prefered to keep his natural form because it was what he felt best in. It made him feel closer to his twin to have a similar form.\n\nNaruto raised Asia's right palm and saw an Infinity symbol for a split second, before the symbol faded away into nothing.\n\nThat same symbol always appeared on his right palm whenever he used this technique, before vanishing after he was finished.\n\nNaruto took a few steps to get used to Asia's longer legs, before he nodded when he found the right balance in this body. It wouldn't do to not be able to dodge attacks in this body before he was able to trasnform back.\n\n\"Okay... now I am ready. Take me to Raynare... now.\" Naruto ordered the Fallen Angel, and Mittelt nodded with a light amount of sweat on her head. Mittelt could only think of one thing when she heard the tone that the order was given in,\n\nRaynare... was going to get killed.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next Update: Naruto the Vampire Jinchuriki (Then) Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Yes, Naruto's Transformation ability is part of Ophis' blessing.**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t23. Chapter 23 A Second Falling\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Did you really need to... do that?\" Asia asked out of serius shock when she saw Kyokan finish chucking trees into the sky when she finally managed to not only knock the Fallen Angel from the sky... knock from the sky was actually a rather tame way of putting what Kyokan did to the Fallen Angel. Since Asia couldn't see what had really happened, she would never know that when Kyokan had nailed the Fallen Angel with the last tree... he had exploded pretty much fromn the tree going through his chest and out of the other side. Asia was lucky that she didn't see it, and was only aware of the fact that the ex-Angel had been knocked from the sky, even though he was most likely a splat on the ground now.\n\n\"Not really, but your face when you saw me rip a tree from the ground... priceless.\" Kyokan commented with a teasing grin stuck to her face, her lips stretching as she showed off her pearly white teeth. Asia wa more worried about the fact that Kyokan seemed not to care about the surrounding forest they were in, and the fact that she had ripped out at least half a dozen trees in the last few minutes alone, not to mention the fact that she had also thrown boulders, a car, and a very unlucky chipmunk that had happened to be inside a bush that she had thrown into the sky. She wanted to laugh so hard at the memory of her seeing a chipmunk flying out of the bush and landing, and mauling, the Fallen Angel for a few moments and giving her the time to aim at it properly so that she could put a tree through the feathered man's chest.\n\nShe was taken out of her thoughts when she felt Asia pulling on her skirt, so looking down at the girl she noticed that Asia was looking not very far away. Looking after what the girl was seeing, she blinked her one eye in sheer confusion when she saw a Fallen Angel with ripped clothes carrying a perfect copy of Asia that was wearing Naruto's cat themed boxers and undershirt. She tilted her head in confusion for a moment, before she lightly smacked Asia in the back of the head and knocked her to the ground to make sure that the one she was holding wasn't a fake. When Asia started to roll on the ground while holding the back of her head, Kyokan nodded in approval at the fact that she had the real one. Asia on the other hand was not so amused when she had to set to work on healing her own head, and the extreme throbbing that she was feeling in her head.\n\n\"Sorry about that, but it would seem that Naruto is using your body to sneak into the enemies territory and finish this as quickly as possible. You know... I hope you don't take what he is doing for you for granted. Naruto does a lot for others, and he gets very little thanks in return. He is placing his own head on the chopping block for you if things go south.\" Kyokan informed Asia when she figured out Naruto's plan based off the fact that the imposter was wearing cat themed boxers like Naruto. Meaning that Naruto had screwed with the Fallen Angel's head to allow him to give her the order to betray her old comrades and sneak him behind enemy lines for them in the guise of Asia. She always wondered how Naruto could do so much stuff, and put so much stress on himself for others with no real thanks in return. Naruto did almost everything for Rias, and while she was kind to him, she almost never really gave him thanks for his work. Naruto never complained about it though, and she doubted he would ever complain about it when he was helping somebody he viewed as a friend.\n\nHis views on friendship were amazing... and scary at the same time in her humble opinion. Naruto would do anything for a friend... and the scary thing was that she knew that he would accept death with a smile if his friends would be able to live because of his sacrifice. That was the part that scared her, because if Naruto was going to die young then that would be the reason, by defending his friends with his life.\n\n\"I really appreciate what he is doing, and I will thank him however I can.\" Asia mumbled when her head started to pound a little less when she was finished healing it from the light smack of doom that she was endured.\n\n\"Good, because you are about to meet your biggest rival in a few... never mind, she is here.\" Kyokan stated as her nose was filled with a light berry smell that she knew from description by Naruto as the shampoo that Rias used to give her hair a cherry scent these days. She turned her head, and standing behind them was not only Rias, but it would seem at some point she had caught up with Blaze and had made sure that he was properly bandaged if the wraps around his gut and upper chest were anything to go by. Behind them was Akeno, and some one of the Fallen Angels from earlier. Behind them, were the rest of Rias' peerage that had finally caught up with them all. With the entire group here, and knowing that she was surrounded by devils, devil hybrids, and a monster hybrid Asia suddenly felt much smaller than she was.\n\n\"... Hi?\" Asia managed to say when she realized that everyone was staring at her with mixed emotions, some positive, and some were very negative. Some seemed to actually have mixed reactions about her as well, while others were to busy gawking at the giant woman next to her that easily towered over everyone else in the area.\n\n\"Ara ara, no need to be so nervous... I can see why Naruto-kun is so taken with you. You do give off that pure aura that he is so fond of, even more pure than your's Buchou.\" Akeno started off her teasing to both girl's, while Riuas frowned and looked at Asia with a hard stare for awhile when confronted with the reason for her most loyal pieces recent bout of disobedience and foolish actions that could cause a lot of problems for the underworld and the three factions. Here was the girl, that was being targeted by the Fallen Angels. Rias pointed her hand at Asia, and a red magic circle appeared in front of her palm with black tinted red magic forming into a misty ball of condenced darkness.\n\n\"I want to kill you. It would solve all of our problems you have caused...\" Rias started out without any real emotion, while Asia backed away in fear at how her life was being directly threatened by the red haired beauty in front of her. The others behind Rias were looking at her in shock at how she was just going to kill somebody in cold blood, before the magic vanished and Rias sighed before crossing her arms under her large breasts and making them seem to squish so that they would appear larger. Issei was crying manly tears of joy at having such a large breasted beauty as his master, before Rias started to speak again. \"... I want to kill you, but I won't. If Naruto saw something in you worth protecting, then that is enough reason for me to at the very least not kill you.\" Rias finished off what she was saying rather sharply, but the smile on her face confused Asia and Kyokan, while Blaze walked over next to Kyokan and nodded to her.\n\n\"So... you got your ass kicked.\" Kyokan commented snidely to Blaze, while he pulled out his gun and shot Kyokan in the side of the head... and her head jerked to the other side as the bullet bounced off her thick skull and skin without causing anything other than a bruise, and some slight dazing. Her snide comment was obviously NOT somethingt hat Blaze was in the mood to put up with right now, not when her was still itching for his next fight.\n\n\"So, since you seem to be a friend of Naruto's that he deemed worthy of risking war for, you and I are going to have a little... talk. Kiba, you take Issei and Blaze togo scout the area for any more Exiled Priests. Murayama and Katase, you go with Akeno into the sky and try to find anything out of the ordinary... Koneko, after learning that you have a part in this... well, you should get ready for a little punishment as well.\" Rias gave out her orders, while Blaze scoffed and gave her the middle finger for trying to give him any form of orders that didn't come out of Naruto's mouth. He had ONR General that he would obey, and that general was Naruto and only him. Rias' brow twitched at the blatant disrespect given to her, before both her eyebrows started to twitch when Kalawarner was mocking with her laughter as well at the fact her new rival was making Rias have a hard time for once.\n\n\"Fuck off Little Red, you may have reincarnated me, but I don't obey you.\" Blaze stated clearly as he speed off through the forest before Rias could think up a retort for that about him being her Knight now. She placed her hand to her head to stave off the coming headache, before she turned around and saw that Kalawarner had already flown off into the sky to search on her own before Rias coud give out an order for her to do something different.\n\n\"Heheheh, just like a Soap Opera.\" Katase managed to say, before a stern glare from Rias made her lips pucker when she realized that she had said that out loud instead of keeping it in her head. Murayama smacked her friend in the back of the head, before they flew off with Akeno closely behind them to make sure they didn't get into too much trouble on their own. Asia gulped when Rias turned the sharp gaze to her again, before she felt Kyokan's conforting hand on her shoulder.\n\n**[Location Change] - Abandoned Church**\n\nRaynare sat on top of the broken cross at the front of the church with a twitching eyebow, why you ask, because her minions should have long since been back by now with the one she wanted. After the humiliation she had suffered the the extraction of the Sacred Gear in Issei had turned out to only be a Twice Critical, she had been so pissed off at not getting something good that she had thrown away the Sacred Gear without thinking about it. When she had realized her mistake in throwing away any Sacred Gear, weak or not, it was already too late because a Sprite Dragon had already taken both the body and the gear away before she could recollect the gear and destroy the body for housing such a pathetic Sacred Gear and getting her to waste her time. Now she had neither something to vent her frustrations on, or a Sacred Gear for her effort, and she was about to give up, before she remembered that she had been recently watching another little lost lamb that had been kicked out of the Church with nowhere to go, so she had arranged for the girl to be brought to this city so that she would be able to take care of her and steal her Sacred Gear.\n\nThe best part, this time she actually knew exactly what Sacred gear the girl had in her possession, and while it wasn't a battle gear, it was even better in her opinion. The ability to heal most injuries in seconds, minus lost limbs and death, was something that was more useful than doubling your power in her opinion. What use was doubling your power against an opponent three times stronger than you, not very much use, but if you could heal yourself you could live to fight another day and grow stronger than the double in power. You could keep coming back for more no matter what was thrown at you, so long as it didn't kill you right away. That was why she considered it vital that she get this Sacred Gear, even if she had to sacrifice the ones she had brought with her, then it would be a small price to pay to get her hands on one of the more rare Sacred Gears that only seem to appear once every few generations.\n\nIf only Issei really did have a Longinus in him, then she would not only have the power to kill gods, but also a way to heal herself in battle when she got her hands on the girl's Sacred Gear. A powerful combination that would put her on a level that would let her surpass even those with twelve wings easily. Then when she finally got twelve wings she would be the most powerfull person in existance, having the ability to kill gods and heal herself while also having amazing powers without them.\n\nOf course, that plan was shot to hell the second she had learned that the pervert had a Twice Critical.\n\nNow she had to make a new plan, and gain strength the old fashioned way with only the ability to heal herself. Then a smirk appeared on Raynare's face when she remembered that there would always be more people to steal Sacred Gears from, three of which were also in this city to her knowledge. The Forbidden Balor View and the Sword Birth would both be good Sacred Gear's for her to steal from the Gremory girl's peerage, and then she would set her sights of the War God's Keen Eye so that she could have an instant mastery over the Sword Birth and any Holy Swords that she gets her hands on. Combine that with time stopping abilities, and she would even need to have a Longinus to kill a god with that combination of Sacred Gears.\n\n'Yes, the more gears the better for me. I might as well, go after Aphrodite's Magic Girdle while I'm at it, the ability to seduce men without equal might not be powerful, but it would be amusing to watch as human men fight over me.' Raynare thought with a dark smile on her face at the chaos she could cause with such a tempting Sacred Gear. After all, why should she stop with one Sacred Gear when she could have even more. She would get those gears even if she had to rip the devils to shreds and pull the gears from their corpses... it didn't work that way, but she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. Maybe then she would be able to go after the Excalibur Fragments, and with the War God's Keen Eye she would instantly be able to use them. With the Forbidden Balor View she would give herself the time to create more demon swords with Sword Birth in the mirror image of the Excalibur Fragments, before she raised an army and destroyed both the Devils and Angels.\n\nShe frowned and turned around when she heard the flap of wings appear behind her, before she saw a young man with pitch black hair and pale skin standing there and looking at her with his onix eyes filled with annoyance. The young man appeared to be younger than she was, but instead of the one pair of wings behind her, this man had three pairs of wings behind his body adding up to six wings total, meaning that he far outranked her in terms of strength. His eyes turned colder when he looked into her eyes, and the moonlight shined behind him and hid the rest of his facial features from view, but she knew exactly who she was dealing with.\n\n\"What are you doing here halfblood spawn?\" Raynare asked with acid in her tone over the fact that a half human had more wings than she did. Yes, the one in front of her was the biggest reason that she had decided to go after Issei's Sacred Gear instead of just killing him like she had originally planned to. This half human brat was the son of one of the Fallen Angels that were leading the group of Fallen Angels known as the Grigori, and in her opinion he wasn't even the son of one of the two leaders that she respected.\n\n\"One word: Traitor. You betrayed the Grigori, and for that I have come to you with a message from Azazel-sama. He sends his regards, and tells you that you aren't allowed to return. If you do, you will be sealed in the deepest parts of Cocytus for nearly bringing war upon us... of course, I don't agree. You should be killed anyway.\" The unknown figured stated coldly as he glared down at the now fearful woman that finally understood that she was not impressing her leaders by collecting Sacred Gears, before her smirk returned to her face.\n\n\"You speak lies brat, now leave and go back to your father. I don't heed the threats of a filthy halfblood that was spawned from that man. If you kill me, then you will be kicked out of the Grigori for killing a pure Fallen Angel like myself.\" Raynare stated, before she saw the man flap his wings and go up to the rafter of the room and take a seat, before she scoffed at how he seemed to be sticking around.\n\n'I never said I would be the one to kill you.' The mystery boy thought when he felt the energies growing closer by the second, one of which was that of a Fallen Angel, and the other was that of a Devil tainted Nekoshou... no doubt it was the Male Queen that had been gaining a reputation in the Underworld for being the last known male Nekoshou, and one of the VERY few males to ever be given the title of Queen. Being in the Grigori, and with his father being a high ranked member, he had access to the spies that watched the rising powers that were suspected to become High Class Devils, and as rumor had it three of the four Satans favored this boy. No doubt he would be getting a recomendation to take the Promotion Exams again to gain the rank of High Class Devil.\n\nHe wouldn't be surprised if Raynare had done something to piss him off without knowing who he was, and thus sealing her fate as a dead woman. Nekoshou were not a race to be messed with, not when they could use Senjutsu to strike an opponents life force directly, or use their rare forms of Youjutsu and mastery over both Senjutsu and Youjutsu together to become monsters in battle. Combine that with their natural hunter instinct from being cats, and this one was a Queen and you had a killing machine that had the speed of a Knight, the Strength and Defence of a Rook, the energy reserves of a Bishop, and the natural Nekoshou abilities that made their race secretely feared by many Devils and Fallen Angels alike. It was a lucky thing that the number of Nekoshou births were very low, and that only three of them were currently in existance because they could be trouble to deal with.\n\nNekoshou... could be very protective of things they viewed as theirs, and if this one was after Raynare, then she had stepped into what he viewed as rightfully his.\n\nHe did smirk though, because in his mind this would be the perfect way for Raynare to die, with her own ambition being the cause of her death, just like it was the reason why she had become a Fallen Angel in the first place.\n\nWhat a fitting end for one such as Raynare, to be done in by her own mistakes that had caused her to fall the first time. Only now she wasn't going to be falling from Heaven.\n\nShe was going to die.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Golden Child (Then) Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t24. Chapter 24 A New Morning\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'How stupid can she be?' Naruto thought as he felt Mittelt carry him in the form of Asia towards the inside of the Church, where he knew that Raynare was now waiting for the arrival of Asia. He found it hard to believe that there wasn't a single guard around the place to defend the 'fort' in case of an attack. Raynare couldn't be foolish enough to believe that she alone could defeat a peerage of devils without any help... oter than the strong life force that Naruto had sensed join up with Raynare, but this force didn't give off an aggressive feeling like one getting ready for battle. Yet, the energy felt excited, and as tempted as he was to remove his collar and find out, he knew that it could easily backfire on him as well. Naruto felt like squirming around in annoyance when Asia's breasts bounced with every step Mittelt took, and not being used to the sensation of bounciung breasts he had to admit that it wasn't the most comfy thing in the world.\n\nHe had a new appreciation for big breasts galls now if they had to deal with this everytime they had to walk or run somwhere. The constricting of his clothes on Asia's body wasn't helping matters in the slightest. Many thoughts ran through his head, the top most one being if Rias and Akeno felt this kind of discomfort when he used their breasts as pillows when he felt like he wanted to take a... cat nap. Yeah, he would admit to liking the frequent nap here and there. He wasn't fond of moving around all the time when he didn't have to, so seeing him sleeping wasn't exactly an odd thing to find for somebody during the day, not to mention that since Devils naturally weren't fond of the sunlight it made him tired... okay, he actually liked the sunlight, but it did make him tired by being out in it.\n\nIn all honesty, maybe going back to the apartment first and getting some of Asia's clothes might have been the smart move, but Naruto wanted this crap over as soon as possible. The longer he waited, the more of a chance that back up would come for the other side. Mittelt had told him that they were a group of traiters from the Grigori, but that still didn't ease his mind since the Grigory was a Fallen Angel based group, which were natural enemies to the Devils. Naruto was taken out of his... her... his thoughts when they entered the Church, and he felt a relativally small portion of his strength leave his body by being in the house of god, even abandoned it was still a strong anti-devil area. One thing Naruto did not like about his body, was the fact that devils had far more weaknesses than either Fallen Angels or Angels, and he also had to add on his Nekoshou weaknesses to that list as well. Of course, power doesn't come without a cost, and his boost in power came with the cost of also having the weaknesses of a race that wasn't naturally his own. Of course, not many people knew what his original race's weaknesses were.\n\n\"Raynare-sama, I hjave brought the nun like you ordered, but all the exiled priests were killed, as were Dohnaseek and Kalawarner. She was hiding in the house of a devil when I found her, it would seem that the devils had been using a decoy to fool us into thinking that the Cyclops was keeping her safe.\" Mittelt informed Raynare, as the black winged woman smirked and got onto the ground. Naruto heard Raynare walking forward to them slowly, and by forcing his empathy ability to grow a little stronger he was able to pick up on her emotions even with the collar on his neck. He wanted to groan at how this girl seemed so satisfied at her own apparent victory, and her guard was down right away now that she had her prize. She wasn't even trying to check and question Mittelt to see if the one in her arms really was Asia.\n\n\"Their loss doesn't equal much in the long run, they were both weak. Even you could have defeated them both if you desired to, so if they died it just showed they were to pathetic to be trusted in the first place.\" Raynare lectured Mittelt, not knowing that she was REALLY starting to get on Naruto's nerves with the way she was talking about her own teammates.\n\n_Those that break rules are trash, but those that abandon their comrades are worse than trash._\n\nNaruto didn't know where he knew that from, but most of his life ever since he had been young those were the words he had lived by. They were words that he believed in to his very core, no matter what would happen he had made a pact to never betray his comrades. When as a child when there were chances to make a better life for himself, and leave his family, he didn't do it. When there were chances for him to leave the Gremory house before he became a devil/nekoshou, he didn't do it because Rias had been a comrade by that point. When he was risking war and breaking the rules to save Asia, he didn't back down and shirk his duty not only because he had an... emotion for her, but also because she was his comrades and friend. Naruto would admit, that because of what he had done his those words would lable him as trash, but Naruto could live with being trash, he was raised on the streets after all, it was a term he was used to, but Raynare on the other hand, she was WORSE then trash for leaving her allies to die and mocking them.\n\n'I may dislike her companions, but they were her allies. She can't be allowed to live if this is how she treats them, enemy or not.' Naruto thought when a soft hand touched his face almost lovingly, and the touch frankly disgusted him to his very core when it was from an evil woman such as this one. Naruto felt the urge to bite her hand off when a finger traced against the paiur of lips that Naruto was borrowing from Asia, and he almost twitched when Raynare laid a han upon his... her breast. Even now he was still confused on what terms to explain when he was in a girl's body, because he was actually a girl right now. If he didn't turn back, then he would never turn back automatically. The changes were REAL down to internal organs, and Naruto hated the fact that it felt slightly... good, to have Asia's breast squeezed for a moment when Raynare actually seemed to be proving Naruto's earlier thoughts wrong and checking to maker sure that this one was actually Asia.\n\nNot that she would find anything to prove that he wasn't Asia, not when he/she was nearly an exact replica of the girl. The only difference at this point was that Naruto was a far stronger version of Asia, with ALL of the powers he had before turning into her. Transforming into others didn't mean that Naruto lost his own powers, but it wasn't like he gained theirs either. If Naruto turned into Rias, then he still didn't have her powers and skills. Deep down he was still a Nekoshou and Devil with his own skills and abilities, and those powers transfered to whatever form he was in. Only those that were very sensative to energy sensing could tell that Naruto was a Nekoshou whenever he was transformed, and this woman had almost NO energy sensing beyong the basic, which wasn't enough to tell what Naruto was when he was hiding his aura. Raynare would be even more surprised before her death when Naruto revealed that she had made a mistake... no, Naruto would keep the form of Asia when he was killing Raynare, that way Raynare would die thinking that Asia was the one to kill her, the very one that she most likely belived was weak and powerless.\n\n\"So... it seems that you have the... girl. What do you plan to do now Raynare?\" A figure asked from the rafters, and Naruto felt a sharp intake of breath from Raynare in a moments of surprise. Either she had forgotten about the figure being there, or she simply didn't know they were there anymore. Naruto was able to open his eyes very lightly to see that the figure was looking down at them with a smirk on his face, and for a brief moment Naruto felt a... burning sensation in the pain of his right hand. Naruto wanted to hiss in pain when the symbol of a Sun with an Infinity symbol inside it started to glow lightly, but not bright enough for Raynare to take notice of it with her eyes focused on the man in the rafters. Naruto himself saw the man grunt as clench his left hand when something glowed purple on it, for a brief second Naruto was sure that he saw something on their as well. If he was right, then what Naruto saw was the image of the Cresent Moon with a Zero in the middle of the hole in the moon.\n\n'This... bastard... who is this Teme?' Naruto thought when the burning started to go down as the symbols on both of their hands stopped glowing and faded away into their skin. The figure trained his eyes to the boy... girl... boy in the body of a girl down bellow and narrowed his eyes for a few moments as well at how his own palm had reacted to something.\n\n'This Nekoshou... what a Dope for forgetting to dress as a girl... I wonder though, that Transformation ability... if I couldn't sense his Nekoshou chakra then I would have mistaken him for that girl as well.' The figure thought as he narrowed his eyes further and tried to piece together why this person had a familiar aura about him, even when he was taking this female form at the moment.\n\n\"Well, first things first, Mittelt, take her to get properly dressed for the extraction process... Mittelt?\" Raynare questionened when she saw that Mittelt was just standing there with a sort of blank expression on her face, with the girl in her arms not moving a little bit either. Raynare raised an eyebrow at how the girl was just staring into nothing blankly, before she jumped back in shock when the eyes of the captured girl opened quickly and looked at her with a light, glare that seriously didn't fit on her face. She stepped back out of shock when the Asia imposter hopped out of Mittelts arms and placed her hand on the girl's shoulder. Raynare glared at Mittelt and summoned a spear of light in her hands to stab Mittelt through the body, before she was kicked in the gut by the Asia standing in front of her. Her face took on a pained shock when she was sent flying through the church by the amazing level of strength behind the kick to the gut, while the figure in the rafters smirked at how Raynare was already getting her death sentence acted out.\n\n\"What... what is the meaning of this Mittelt!? Why is this girl awake... answer me!\" Raynare shouted after a few seconds when Mittelt made no move to even answer her question. She saw the blond haired girl that she was after wrap an arm arounf Mittelt's shoulders, while the blond haired Fallen Angel made a small face at the touch.\n\n\"Sorry, but Mittelt serves under a new leader now... I am very upset with you for trying to steal my Sacred Gear Raynare.\" Naruto said while pretending to be Asia, and doing a perfect job of imitating her voice as well. Raynare slowly stood back up, before she started to cough when a pain erupted in her stomach when she tried to stand straight. Naruto smirked very lightly at how she wasn't as durable when it came to hand to hand combat, meaning she was a long distance type of fighter. That would be good to know... if he was actually planning on fighting her, but he had different plans. This wasn't going to be a fight, this was an murder.\n\n\"How the hell are you this strong!?\" Raynare shouted, before she started coughing again with blood coming out of her mouth from the stress she was putting on her body. Naruto shook Asia's head and looked at the girl while making sure that she saw the mocking expression.\n\n\"I wouldn't stand if I were you, my attack ruptured a few organs no doubt. You will only speed up your own death if you move... maybe your companion can-\" Naruto started, before being interupted by said companion.\n\n\"Raynare and I aren't allies, she is a traitor to the Grigori and this is her fate. You are free to kill her without the Grigori retaliating for her death. I am just sticking around to see if she will die or not, then I will be out of here.\" The person explained without any emotion, and the look on Naruto's face showed just how perfect the situation became for him now that he knew for sure that there wouldn't be a war for him killing this woman. Raynare scoffed when she finished coughing, before she winced when the sunlight of the morning started to stream through the window and hit her in the face, while Naruto started to walk forward to her with a chuckle leaving his mouth.\n\n\"You know, I learned from Issei that you went by the name Yuuma Amano, or Amano Yuuma... Ama no Yuuma. Heaven's Evening Daze, so how fitting would it be for you to die by my hands... during the morning, the opposite of the evening. The evening only comes once a day, before a new evening comes the next day... you were yesterday Raynare, which means that a new evening will come and wipe out the one from the day before... prepare to be wiped out... Yuuma.\" Naruto explained the irony behind the fact that Yuuma had chosen her own means of death in a way, by given herself a name that meant evening, she had made the most fitting way for her to die in the morning. She had killed a human in the evening, and was being killed by a devil in the morning. She extracted Issei's Sacred Gear when it was growing dark, signifying the loss of a life, while her death would mean a brighter tomorrow.\n\n\"You... you aren't the girl... she doesn't have this kind of power!?\" Raynare shouted in fear when she started to move backwards, only to trip on the ground and land on her butt. Naruto tilted back Asia's head and Raynare watched as Asia's green eyes became Naruto's yellow eyes and she finally placed the pieces together in a way. Naruto turned his yellow eyes back into her green eyes again with a smirk on Asia's face that showed Raynare that she had been trapped the entire time.\n\n\"You got it, Asia is too pure of a girl to hold a grudge or kill somebody. That is why I am going to do it in her place, because scum like you doesn't need to exist anymore.\" Naruto said as he pointed Asia's pale hand right at Raynare and summoned a bubble in his hands that was filling with a red fluid at a rapid pace. Once the bubble was completely filled with pink fluid, the bubble itself turned pinkish as it became more transparent. Naruto poked the bubble with a finger, and it started to float over Raynare slowly, giving her a chance to look at it with annoyance. Just as she was about to form a spear of light and attack either him or the bubble, Naruto snapped feminine fingers and popped the bubble on command. Suddenly, the harmless bubble didn't seem so harmless when it popped and released all of it's stored liquid on her body.\n\nIf she was in pain before, she was in so much pain now that she was only able to silently scream as she clawed at her own skin when a horrible burning and itching sensation spread through her very being. Her beautiful skin became less so when it started to melt and burn away, before her skin started to drip on the ground around her. Her blood soon started to seep out of her rapidly melty body when the potent acid distorted her features even more before she was quickly no longer able to be identified as the person she once was. Naruto almost puked at the smells of burning flesh and death, before he decided to end it early and pointed a finger at her.\n\nHer body was soon enveloped in blue flames that quickly burned her away until their was nothing left but ashes, and those ashes quickly blew away across the floor.\n\nMittelt looked away from what was once her leader, and a fellow Fallen Angel. Kalawarner may have been saved, but not even reincarnation could save you when yoru body was turned completely to ashes like this. The figure in the stands nodded in satisfaction, befoe he was surrounded by a black magic circle and teleported away from the scene of the murder with the knowledge that Raynare had been killed.\n\nNaruto sighed in relief, because with Raynare now dead, Asia was safe. With that in mind, Naruto used his transforming ability to turn back. He lost the gain in height being Asia gave him, before all the other changes started to revert back as well, before Naruto was back to normal just as the light started to increase through the large window in the front by even more. Naruto smiled when the sun touched him.\n\nThen Naruto started to sweat when he realized something.\n\nNow that Asia was safe, he still had his punishment coming to him. He only had one word that came to his mind right now.\n\nCrap.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**As Author, I can change my mind about what I want to update and when. Complaining won't change anything.**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Questions Omake next chapter!**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t25. Chapter 25 Punishment\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nThe room was tense... that was the first thing that Naruto noticed when he teleported into the Occult Reseach Society's club room. The tension was so thick, that he was almost able to cut it with a dagger if he felt like it. He immediantly stiffened when he saw that BOTH Rias and Koneko were giving him glares, even though each glare was saying different things to him. He was sure that Rias had a good reason to be angry at him, because he had been disobeying her this entire time and had been knowingly risking war with the Fallen Angels, and bringing chaos with his actions. Her glare told him that he was going to get punished for that reason, but under her glare Naruto was able to tell what she was truly feeling. He didn't need his empathy abilities to know what was going on deep inside her mind. He could read her like a book without even trying these days.\n\nRias was proud, happy, and a little hurt.\n\nRias was no doubt proud of him for the fact that he had led a team of three, not counting Asia, and had killed a group that had turned out to count up to 120 exiled priests and defeated 4 Fallen Angels with only a single death on his side of things. From the view point of a King that would be not only a success, but an amazingly effective show of his own skills as a strategist. If he could lead a battle with only a few warriors into a small army of people trained to kill supernatural being with only one death, then he was a very talented person when it came to on the fly tactics. It looked good on both of them, and it was something that could get him a recomendation for the rank of High Class if word of it got to one of the more militaristic upper level devils that had the power to offer recomendations. If Rias had a High Class Devil in her peerage, then she would also gain more fame for having the youngest non-natural devil attain the rank of High Class Devil without having been in a real Rating Game.\n\nShe was happy, because despite what she says, she does like it when her peerage follows what their guts tell them so long as they come out of it okay. She was also happy that out of this whole thing, she was the one that ultimately won in the end. Naruto may have protected Asia, and Asia may still be alive with her Sacred Gear, but Rias was the one that gained two new peerage members that had a lot of potential to them. Both Blaze and Kalawarner were pretty muchy talor made to helping her defeat a peerage of devils, which made them great weapns against Riser. Both of them were already well trained, and Blaze had a Sacred Gear while Kalawarner could still use her Light Element without fear of hurting herself. Not to mention that she was satisfied with the fact that Naruto had added another new person to his list of people he would be adding to his own possible future peerage, somebody that already feared and respected him in a way that would insure her loyalty until she gained a real respect for the Nekoshou and his way of things.\n\nFinally, she was hurt that Naruto had chosen somebody else over her. Naruto had weighed following Rias, and saving Asia... and saving Asia won out. Naruto and Rias had been the best of friends for years now, and he almost threw that away because of a silly promise he made himself to protect a human nun, one that had been causing him so much pain by being around him. He had done this with the full knowledge that he could be hurting their friendship, he didn't this time since Rias was pretty damn sure that this wasn't truly about him chosing Asia over her, but more the fact that Naruto by now had some sort of addiction to Asia. Naruto himself was sure that something would happen if he couldn't be around Asia anymore. He was sure that hye had some sort of addiction to her at this point, but it wasn't like he was bothered by this fact.\n\nFinally... he had no clue why the hell Koneko was mad at him, or maybe she was simply mad because she was being punished with him for harboring Asia as well. That, or she was just annoyed that she and Naruto hadn't had any alone time in awhile because of Asia being there.\n\n\"Sooo... I am in a lot of trouble... aren't I nya?\" Naruto questioned with a raised eyebrow, and Rias simply crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes at him when she noticed the way he was speaking. His tone didn't really sound like he was sorry for anything he had done, but that was simply because Naruto was rarely ever willing to say sorry for something when he did it on purpose. If Naruto pranked you, he wasn't going to sya sorry because he did it on purpose, but if he did something without meaning to that was when he was willing to apologize for his actions, and only then would he admit to his own fault. He was just stubborn like that when it came to admitting his own blame in matters he was serious about.\n\n\"Trouble does not begin to describe what you are in. Grayfia will be here on her next day off to give you a 'lecture' on how a Queen should act. Kuroka has also been informed of your little episode, and will be here in about a week to deliver her own... unique punishment. Until then, you are going to face the punishment that I give you... which will be decided by the very one you saved.\" Rias stated as she looked over to Asia on the couch of the clubroom, while the other people in the room looked between Asia and Rias with raised eyebrows. Akeno was silently giggling at how the most sadistic thing Rias could have done was make the person that Naruto saved be the one to punish him, something that was both humiliating and something that would teach Naruto a deeper lesson if he was paying attention. Rias had picked the best punishment for Naruto, but not one that would really humiliate him in the end if Akeno had her say in this. Of course, if she had her way then Naruto would be wearing some of Gasper's clothes and made to be the personal servant to the clubn for the rest of the wee or something like that... she would pay money to see Naruto dress like a girl... never mind, that really wasn't a good punishment for a person that was sure of his sexuality like Naruto was. All it would do to him would increase his ego when people started to fawn over him even more than they already did, and his fan base would increase to not only girls, but also boys as well.\n\n'I don't get it... is he being punished or not?' Issei thought while scracthing his head in confusion, since he couldn't imagine a sweet girl like Asia coming up with anything that bad. Even the few moments he had spent around her had told him that she was truly a goody goody in almost everything but the fact that she was willing to live with a devil at all even after finding out about their nature was something that would truly lable her as the heretic that she now was in full. Before she had just been kicked out of the church, but now she had gone against God's teachings by having affections for Naruto at all.\n\n\"I don't get why Naruto is being punished, or why Red gets to say that he deserves to be punished. Peerage member or not, he still has free will. I think that him risking war for the girl is a great thing, a real man goes through any lengths to protect his woman. Of course, you wouldn't know anything about that being a woman yourself.\" Blaze commented from his spot of leaning against the wall, a frown on his face, while the other girl's in the room seemed to take his words as an insult to their gender. Blaze realized that he had misworded that, but made zero attempts to correct himself. He stood by what he said when he said how a woman would never truly understand a man and their pride, just like how a man would never be able to understand how a woman truly felt... well, a woman was more willing to talk about her feelings, so men could understand women after having been around them long enough. Seeing as most men kept their feelinsg and deeper thoughts to themselves, it was harder for women to comprihend what they were feeling.\n\nOf course, that wasn't what this was about.\n\nNaruto was being punished for protecting what was his, so of course he would rish war to make sure she was safe. That was pretty damn romantic to him, so either Rias was totally jealous of how Asia was getting more romantic affection from Naruto than her, or she was just refusing to see things Naruto's way as well.\n\n\"I agree with Blaze, a man has to go for what he has to go for... things like girls and breasts for me.\" Issei stated with a nod, before he was smacked in the side of the head by a pillow thrown by Koneko. The pillow knocked Issei from the couch, and made him slam into the wall before he slumped down to the floor while knocked out.\n\n'She hit him a bit too hard...' Yuuto thought as he poked the downed Issei with the side of his foot, only for the brown haired boy not to stir in the slightest at the prodding. Shrugging, he knelt down and alung one of Issei's arms over his shoulder, before he made his way out of the room.\n\nThis was not something that he needed to be here for.\n\n\"Um... I don't want to punish Naruto at all.\" Asia pointed out shyly, after her talk in the forest with Rias it wasn't that hard for her to gain a small fear of the red haired girl. She looked at Naruto for support, only to see him shrug at her and nod his head slowly.\n\n\"It's fine with me Asia, I knew that I was going to have a punishment or two because of my actions. Despite the fact you aren't with the Church anymore, by killing the Fallen Angels and the exiled priests it was possible that I instigated a conflict with the Devils and Fallen Angels that could lead to war... then the Angels will strike at the winner when they are weakened.\" Naruto admit to knowing what he had been doing this entire time, and in his mind Asia was completely worth the risk he had taken when killing those Fallen Angels and exiled priests. He had known that everything he had done could have ended up in the starting of a new war, but he had done it anyway despite the risks involved. It didn't matter that Asia wasn't a member of the Church anymore, because there were plenty of Devils and Fallen Angels that would love the chance to start a new war over this incident.\n\n\"Forget it, it seems that I will have to come up with my own punishment for you and Koneko...\" Rias commented as her hand went to her chin when she started to think of something that would be a good idea.\n\n\"I have an-\" Akeno started with a slight amount of glee to her voice.\n\n\"Denied. I want them punished, not tramatized.\" Rias responded before Akeno could even finish her sentence, and in responce to that responce Akeno pouted and walked out of the room now that her idea for a punishment had been rejected. And to think that she would have loved the chance to punish the two cuties with a little bit of S&M or maybe even some hard core bondage... oh well, she could always get them another day. Until then she would have to just settle for using the dummies to refine her skills, and then when the day came that she could use it on them she would be ready and waiting. Oh yes, she would be waiting with as much patience as she needed to even if she had to wait dozens of years for either of them to fall into her trap.\n\nShe honestly hoped that she could practice on Koneko or Gasper first before going onto Naruto... speaking of which, Akeno gained a glint in her eye when she looked at the box that Gasper was hiding in. The shy boy had hidden the second that he had seen Blaze and Kalawarner walk into the room, the new faces making his shyness even more extreme. If she couldn't have the twins, then she would settle for the silver meddle and practice some of the new techniques she was learning from her magazine. Going over to the box, she grabbed the sides before picking up not only the box, but also Gasper inside the box, before she took both Gasper and the box out of the room.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Gasper, but happy it isn't me... naw, Gasper should be able to escape, and I am sure that Akeno won't go to far... hopefully.\" Naruto stated with a bland smile as he watched one of his friends get taken away, before his ears picked up the sound of Gasper gasping out of shock, before Akeno made some sort of disappointed sound... meaning that Gasper had been able to turn into a flock of bats and escape from the woman in time. Naruto nodded lightly, before his attention was pulled to Rias when she coughed into her hand to try and keep his attention.\n\n\"I'm out... you and me, sparring... now.\" Blaze stated as he grabbed Kalawarner by the back of the trenchcoat and pulled her out of the room with him, while the others looked at her in pity. The look on the boy's face was not a very nice one, before Yuuto looked at Rias.\n\n\"I am going to make sure nobody gets killed again.\" Yuuto commented dryly as he followed Blaze and Kalawarner out of the room, leaving only Naruto, Asia, Rias, and the confused Kyokan in the room. This wasn't the first time that Naruto had done something Rias wouldn't approve of, unless Rias didn't know about the other things that Naruto did... or she did and didn't care so long as Naruto didn't start a war over it apparently. Of course, nobody would believe that Naruto was secretely sending prank letters to not only the Four Satans, but also the other Lords and Ladies of the Pillar Families.\n\nRias sighed, before she leaned back and placed a hand to her head... before her face lit up as an idea came to her head.\n\n\"I just go the perfect punishment.\" Rias said with a wicked smile on her face, and both siblings immediently hugged each other and started to shake out of terror when Rias' smile turned dark and sinister laughter started to be heard through the entire room.\n\nHer idea was one worthy of a devil such as herself.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Strange Mage**_  \n_**{Challenge: I would like somebody to make a 'Reading' fic of Naruto the Strange Mage.

Chapter 26 Bad Kitten's Punishment\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**I decided to update this instead.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"I'm going to molest you!\" A feminine voice called out in the front of the school, and if that by itself wasn't strange enough, but very soon the students of Kuoh Academy were graced with the image of their resident 'cutie' running for dear life from what was possibley his greatest fear of all time... well, not his greatest, because Naruto had a few others fears as well that were worse than his current issue. Right now Naruto was undergoing his punishment for almost starting a war, something that Rias knew would bother him the most at the moment.\n\nYou see, ever since Naruto was young he had this fear, a justified fear that all of shota and loli kind secretely feared above many things. When he had been very young, Naruto had been introduced to the concept of the thing that he was currently being chased by, or at least an imitation made to freak him about. Right now, Rias had called in a favor to Sona and had requested that Tomoe, Son'a Knight, dress up in a bear costume and chase Naruto around. Now, for most people this was annoying, but not in this case.\n\nYou see, Tomoe Meguri was a girl that had an interest in younger and younger looking boys about Naruto's age and look. That was the main reason that Rias had requested that Sona let her borrow this girl, so that she could dress up as one of Naruto's three great irrational fears. Number two on the list of things that freaked him out, and it wasn't molesters per say, but one molester in general.\n\nPedobear.\n\nYes, that was right, Naruto was afraid of being molested by Pedobear, and that was why Tomoe was dressed up as the very bear that Naruto was afraid of, because Rias knew that Naruto's irrational fear of the pedophile bear would overwrite his common sense and punish him in the form of the entire school learning of their mascot's fear and seeing him run away from a girl in a bear costume.\n\nTomoe hads agreed, because Rias had told her that if she caught Naruto then she could grab him by the back of the neck and molest the hell out of him, so long as Naruto doesn't lose his chastity from the ordeal. This had been more than enough for Tomoe to get pumped up to chanse after the younger boy with the intent to molest him, which made his fear all the more real in this case. If she caught him, then she was going to honestly molest him, something that she had full permission to do so long as Naruto doesn't lose his virginity.\n\n\"I need an adult nya!\" Naruto shouted with comical tears rushing from the sides of his eyes as he ran full sprint away from the costumed bear with yellow glowing eyes and a pedophile grin on it's face. Naruto may be a Queen, but Tomoe was a Knight with much longer legs than he had, which meant that she was more than capable of keeping up with his faster speed. He was smaller and faster, but she was taller and her longer legs let her keep pace with him so that he gained zero ground despite the fact that she was running in a bear suit.\n\n\"I'm going to molest you... and I AM an adult!\" Tomoe shouted out from her costume, and many students that they passed by started to laugh at the scene playing out in front of them. Naruto was seriously freaking out right now, because as he ran away he didn't even notice that he was being laughed at by Issei, who was dying on the ground with his fists hitting the ground when he was spotted laughing his guts out at Naruto. Naruto was to busy running from the now not very secret fear he had... something that he could completely blame Akeno for in the first place. He was really annoyed with Akeno right now... this was all her fault. If Akeno had never told him about Pedobear, and then spent a while year chasing him and jumping out of his closet in a pedobear costume he wouldn't even have this fear... or those times she jumped in on him in the shower, bath, eating, or just when he was relaxing with Koneko.\n\nThis was all her fault that Naruto was afraid of pedobear... and because he didn't want to get molest by a bear, that helped things.\n\n\"This sucks so hard!\" Naruto shouted as he passed by a group of giggling girls, each of which had a jealous blush on their faces... oh god, now he might have to deal with more people trying to molest him in pedobear costumes.\n\n\"I'm going to molest you!\" Tomoe shouted again to remind Naruto that she was nipping at his heels with how close she had gotten, and Naruto jolted in fright and started to increase his running speed. Naruto grabbed the corner of a wall to help him turn the corner as fast as he could without going beyond human speeds, something he still had to maintain to keep a relativally normal appearance in the school.\n\n\"Stop shouting that NYA!?\" Naruto pleaded with the girl as she turned the corner made some grabbing motions with her hands as she ran at him, and even with the bear suit blocking her face, the molester expression on the costume was more than enough to freak him out.\n\n\"I'm going to molest you even harder now Naruto-kun!\" Tomoe shouted in joy, before she frowned inside the costume when Naruto jumped out of her reach again and his claws lengthened lightly so that he could climb up one of the trees in the front of the school. He got up to one of the branches that was closer to the bottom, but still out of her usual reach, and looked down at her with a serious expression on his face for somebody that was staring down a molester bear.\n\n'I would rather learn how to swim, than let you catch me.' Naruto thought with a deadpan as he hissed lightly at the girl jumping up and trying to get to him. Why couldn't he just get a spanking like Koneko did when Rias had punished her?! Why did he have to be the one that might be molested if he let his guard down for even a second too long? It wasn't very fair, but then again Koneko wasn't afraid of Pedobear... brave girl. Nope, he was the only one being threatened with the fear of those with small bodies. Naruto jumped out of the tree and landed on top of Tomoe quickly, before he bounced off her and opushed her to the ground long enough for him to make his escape so that he would have a good head start in the time that it took for her to stand up, and take his advatnage he did when he put on a burst of speed.\n\nSkirts around him went flying up, and a sea of panties were visible everywhere he passed by, which was something that the men and perverts at the school would be thanking him for.\n\n\"Somebody help me, a molester bear is chasing me in the hopes of getting in my pants nya!?\" Naruto shouted out one of his usable options for avoiding getting caught. Naruto's shout grabbed the attention of everyone that was now looking at him, and standing still for a brief moment Naruto mad ethem stare him in the eyes, before hsi eyes glowed very lightly for a few brief moments as he activated his Charm ability.\n\nSuddenly, to everyone in the area Naruto got ten times as cute as he already was, and he seemed to be sparkling with a pure unadulterated attractive appeal that seemed to get to everyone in his range that was currently looking at him. With his Charm activated, suddenly the people around him didn't find the thought of him being chased around by a molester to be funny or cute at the moment, something which Naruto would be using to his advantage to avoid this form of punishment... would his reputation take a hit, yes. Would he be expected to act a bit cuter for awhile by the girls in the cute, most likely. Would this be worse than the time that Naruto had helped Sirzechs dig a giant hole in his backyard so that he could put a giant pool in his yard... but both of them made a mistake and almost got buried alive with only their heads sticking out fo the ground before Rias and Grayfia found them and pulled them out of the ground in humiliation.\n\nMost likely not, that one was pretty bad in Naruto's opinion.\n\nThey had been in the ground for 4 hours before help had arrived, and while they could have busted out, that would have destroyed a lot of land.\n\n\"Come on girls, lets save Naruto-kun's chastity!\" One of the average looking students proclaimed with excitement as they all charged in the direction that the pedobear had last been seen, while Naruto sighed and held his chest in relief at the temporary distraction from having to run away from the bear of his nightmares.\n\n\"I'm going to molest you...\" A voice whispered into Naruto's ear for a moment, before Naruto jumped so high that his claws were now sinking into the side of the building and holding him up a good thirty feet above ground. Naruto almost had a heart attack, before he frowned when he realized that the voice that had said that was now barking out laughter in a more masculine voice than before. Looking down at the ground, Naruto's eye twitched when he saw that the person that had tricked him was none other than one of the most perverted people Naruto had ever had the _joy_ of working with, and he didn't say that lightely. Naruto's eye twitched when he saw that Issei had been the one to whisper that, and next to Issei was the most likely mastermind behind the idea Yuuto. The blond haired boy was smiling up at Naruto, while Issei laughed his ass off on the ground.\n\n\"Not cool nya... so not cool.\" Naruto stated as he let go of the school building and fell to the ground in a way that he landed right on top of Issei, before he twitched in annoyance when him landing on Issei didn't do much more than merely wind the boy because of the fact he had landed on his chest.\n\nDamnit light weight body, and your surprisingly amazing amount of muscle power. The one time being heavy would have been more appreciated, you had to be light.\n\n\"Consider this payback for making everyone thing I was homosexual a few monthes back, and a little extra for what you are going to do this weekend.\" Yuuto said with a hint to Issei as well, and the brown haired boy stood up and forced Naruto away from him and looked at the two of them in curiousity.\n\n\"What happens this weekend, and why are you gettin g early revenge for it?\" Issei couldn't resist asking the question on his mind, and Yuuto seemed more than happy to explain while Naruto grinned. He had forgotten that it was almost that day of the month, something that he truly enjoyed about hanging out with the others.\n\n\"Guy's Night... usually Naruto, Gasper, and I will pick a place at random and have Buchou use the teleportation circle send us there for the night so that we can have a litte fun with just us guys. Normally though, Naruto gets us in a little trouble with his pranks... or disrespect for authority, and we end up running away from the police or priests.\" Yuuto stated with a deadpan look at Naruto for the last one, and the white haired boy scratched the back of his head with a light grin.\n\n\"Hey, not my fault that people can't take a joke. You put a few dozen smoke bombs in a police station, and suddenly your public enemy number one... at least Rias was able to use a memory altering spell to make them forget us.\" Naruto said with a genuine grin on his face, his whiskered cheeks stretching to fit the more cat-like grin that his face was acomodating at the moment.\n\n\"Don't worry Issei, you are more than welcome to come with us on Guy's Night. Gasper would be happy to have you come as well, and Blaze-san might like to-\" Yuuto started, before Naruto shook his head before Yuuto could finish.\n\n\"Blaze isn't the party type of person, not when he could be using his time training or spending time with his family. He won't be coming on Guy's Night even if he wanted to, his father will be coming to visit soon anyway, and he has to get his house ready.\" Naruto explained with a light shrug of his shoulders, and Yuuto nodded in acceptance at the understandable reason. Right now Blaze was the only person in the peerage with a human family, which made it understandable that he would want to spend his time with them... well, Issei had a human family as well, but his family were the average family so nothing should be happening to them anytime soon.\n\n\"Okay, so just you, me, Gasper, and Issei then if Blaze isn't coming along. Do you... and there he goes.\" Yuuto commented when Naruto started to run in a panic when Tomoe came from around the corner and chased after Naruto again, passing by both of the teens without sparing them even a passing glance with her true target so close to her.\n\n\"I'm going to molest you!\" The now duo heard as the feminine pedobear chased after Naruto, before both of them cracked a smile at Naruto's misfortune.\n\nIt would seem that even the mighty Naruto had some pretty stupid things he was afraid of.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure\"**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t27. Chapter 27 Appeal\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Naruto I said I was sorry, please stop hiding behind Asia-san.\" Rias asked nicely to her Queen the day after her own... unique, punishment had been given to her unrulely Queen. She had only picked the punishment, because that was the best punishment that would actually get to Naruto anymore... well besides trying to put him in deep water, but that was more life threatening to him then she would be comfy with doing for a simple punishment. That would be going a bit too far in her opinion, while letting a nice girl like Tomoe feel Naruto up a little if she caught him was perfectly acceptable in her opinion.\n\nHonestly, it was like people though that she was just letting Naruto get molested. Tomoe was a member of Sona's peerage after all, one of the strictest young devils about proper behavior in the rookie Kings. There was no way that she would have a rapist or REAL molester in her peerage, and all Tomoe had been given permission to do was a little touching and some looking if she caught Naruto... IF being the main word here. Trying to catch Naruto had been what had made this funnier, because she never did catch him. She had come very close many times, but she never laid a hand on him that would give her the permission to see what she wanted to see of the smaller male.\n\nNaruto had been perfectly safe, this had just been a play on his fear of Pedobear... whose fault completely Akeno's for instilling that damn fear into Naruto in the first place. Jumping from random places at random times and groping Naruto while wearing a strange bear constume would give many people a fear of such a bear. The fact that Naruto had been told stories about Pedobear as a kid by Sirzech and even Kuroka to scare him had just tramatized him to the point that even as a 15 year old he had a completely rational and irrational fear of Pedobear and anything Pedobear related.\n\n\"Not funny Rias, you know Pedobear freaks me out... it's not funny Kalawarner!\" Naruto shouted in annoyance to the ex-Fallen Angel when he noticed her hiding her laughter with a sly smirk on her face at how the mighty Naruto was afraid of a little figure made to scare children and for the amusement of teens that were fans of loli and shota related things. She gulped though when she noticed that Blaze was glaring at her from the other side of the room, something that she did nnot find nearly as funny.\n\n\"I agree, to the Shota and Loli, Pedobear is a very real fear for them, just as real as most of our fears are to us. Everyone is afraid of something. I am afraid of shots, and the giant idiot is afraid of contact lenses... not all fears have to make sense either.\" Blaze pointed out in the defence of his friends admittedly stupid fear, but who was he to judge. He wasn't small like Naruto, so Pedobear wasn't a real issue with him. The punishment was unusual, and he was angry at Rias for having the gall to punish Naruto, but he wasn't going to interfere with Naruto's wishes on this. Others might not have noticed, but his 'Keen Eye' if he was to be so crude, was able to see the slightly haunted look in Naruto's eyes after this had been over.\n\nNaruto was a good... no, a GREAT person. Naruto had also killed over thirty people, broken ones mind, and was the cuase of a friends death, even if he was reborn in the same night. Naruto had known he would be killing, and now that he had done it and murdered in cold blood he felt extremely guilty for this. Naruto hated killing with a passion, even if he was killing the enemy, no matter how much he pretended it didn't bother him.\n\nThis was his atonement for murder, Naruto was letting Rias and the others punish him so that he could cleanse his hands of the blood on them. He wanted to believe that he had been punished for the murder of others, living beings with hopes and dreams, and the fact that Naruto had killed them hurt him deeply on the inside. If he didn't let himself get punished, then Naruto would have trouble sleeping at night, or just living with himself because of the lost lives his actions had caused.\n\nThat was why Naruto was willing to take any punishment that was given to him, not only for his sake, but so that the punishment does not fall onto anyone else either. He made himself the target of the punishment, so that nobody else would have to bare the blame for this.\n\n\"You aren't tiny, so Pedobear leaves you alone! I hear you giggling Akeno, and it is your fault I have this fear remember!?\" Naruto shouted from behind the confusedn Asia, with his arms wrapped around her stomach and his face peeking out from her side. Rias' cheeks puffed up for a moment in annoyance at how Naruto was treating this as a joke, because she could see the small smile on his face now that part of his mouth was visible, thus showing the real reason that he had... nevermind, she could now see Akeno holding a picture of Pedobear neabry while teasing Naruto with her silent giggles almost unheard. She sighed and placed a hand on her head, before sending Akeno a look that plainly told her to stop tormenting Naruto.\n\n'I wonder where Mittelt is... oh yeah, she was sent down to the Underworld for some reason. I think it was for some sort of official business about a Devil having a Fallen Angel as a servant or something.' Kalawarner thought with slight annoyance written on her face when the boredom of everyday life started to get to her. She had already trasnfered to this school, but unlike the others her body wouldn't really let her pass off as a teenager as easily, so she had taken up a post as a math teacher. She would have prefered history, since she actually knew much of that by heart, but math wasn't her worst subject... that solely rested on science. She completely sucked at that subject, so teachint it would just as much of a hell as learning it... which she would have to do to teach it.\n\n'Lucky little bastard, pressed up against Asia-san's back like that... I bet he is totally getting a good feel of her sweet ass.' Issei thought in a real sense of jealousy, before he and everyone else when Naruto went flying towards with him a comical expression of anger on his face. Issei was able to have enough time for his skin to go pale when he noticed that Naruto's fingernails were now claws, meaning that he was fixing to be in a world of some kind of hurt.\n\n\"Gaaaaoooooh nya!\" Naruto shouted as he landed fangs first on Issei... and Issei stopped moving completely when Naruto's fangs were felt getting deeper into his forehead. Blood started to splurt out of his head, and Naruto let his body go limp so that the only thing keeping him attached to Issei were his fangs in the poor boy's head.\n\n...\n\n\"Get him off ow ow ow get him OFF!?\" Issei shouted in pain as he grabbed Naruto by the waist and tried to pull the white haired boy from his cranium, something he was not having any success in no matter how much he had tried to yank on the smaller boy. He was pulling as hard as he could, and Naruto's fangs just stayed firmly in place. He even tried spinning around as fast as he could to get Naruto to simply fall off, but Naruto still stayed firmly biting Issei's head. Naruto had felt Issei's jealousy now that he wasn't currently wearing his collar to block emotions from getting to him, and he had felt that his position behind Asia had been what had b=caused the jealousy, which meant that Issei had been thinking pervy things about Asia.\n\n\"Otouto, take that out of your mouth... you don't know where it has been.\" Koneko stated to Naruto in her own version of a demanding tone, and Naruto paused and let go of Issei so that he fell to the ground on his feet.\n\n\"Asia is off limits Issei, and Onee-chan. Perv on somebody else nya.\" Naruto said with a finger pointed at Issei as he placed the two he was closest two on a list of people that Issei couldn't perv on. The two of them were on the list for obvious reasons, because they were both close to him in a form that would mean he didn't want anyone else thinking of them. If Issei wanted then he could still be a pervert over Rias and Akeno, as well as the others, simply because their bodies were so seductive that it was almost impossible for a pervert like Issei to not focus on them.\n\n\"Speaking of Asia-san, have you decided if you would like to join my peerage or not?\" Rias questioned the only human in the room, and mosty likely the first human nun that had no hatred for devils, while also enjoying their presence. It was a strange thing for Rias to adjust to when getting used to a nun that had no hatred for them, and maybe no hatred for anything really. She couldn't feel a negative bone in this girl's body, something that attested to just how much of a pure hearted girl she was. She could tell that whoever Asia fell in love with would be a pucky person that would be gaining a great and loyal wife, and at the risk of sounding like her mother, she would admit that Asia was a girl with a great body for the process of childbirth.\n\nThat was why she... approved if Asis and Naruto ever did get into a relationship, because she could tell this girl would never hurt her precious Queen on purpose.\n\nKoneko on the other hand, but looking at Asia with what could be called mixed emotions, something that on it's own was strange for the very stoic girl. On one hand, she was already used to the girl so she wasn't that surprised that Naruto was taking refuge behind the girl at the time, even it was only in jest. Now that she was hearing that Asia had been offered a place in Rias' peerage she was curious as to what she would pick, and she both wanted her to say yes, and no. Koneko knew her brother well enough to know that he had feelings for Asia, feelings she was sure even he hadn't noticed as anything other than the desire to protect the girl. Of course, she wasn't very fond of that idea for many reasons, one of which was why she wanted to have Asia become a devil. It was also the same reason why she wanted Asia to stay a human.\n\nNaruto would be living a LONG time, while Asia was not from a long lived species, meaning that she would die on him unless he was killed or got a disease before she died. If the two of them got together, then Asia would eventually break his heart when she died before him. That was why Koneko wanted to have Asia become a devil, on the chance that the two of them got together, even if she didn't really like it. That was also the reason she didn't want them to turn Asia into a devil, so that Naruto would have a reason not to be with her.\n\n\"You offered a nun a position into your peerage?\" Yuuto questioned with a small smile on his face, despite his confusion over the situation. Rias nodded and gave Asia a small frown, before she removed the frown from her face and smiled.\n\n\"Yes, for reasons I won't state at this time, I believe that Asia would do good with my peerage. She has already been accepted into the club and the school, so why not place her with our group... before Sona tries to get to her.\" Rias stated her lesser reasons for this, while also showing that she was rather annoyed with Sona for trying to take people that she was after from her. Of course, that had backfired on Sona as well because she had revealed herself as a devil to Issei without being able to turn him into a devil, showing that she had a moment of poor judgement in her ability to turn Issei into a devil, oh well, because of her Rias now had the motivation to actually look for members and approach them without them being in mortal peril like Akeno, already dead like Issei, Yuuto, Blaze, Kalawarner, and Gasper, or given to her as gifts like Naruto and Koneko. If this went well then Asia would be the first person that actually had a real choice in the matter when it came to joining her peerage. Katase and Murayama didn't count, since it was Naruto that had convinced them into joining her peerage in the first place.\n\nShe wanted Asia in her peerage, but at the same time she wanted the girl as far away from her peerage as possible because of the fact Rias still didn't completely trust the nun to not try anything. Of course, she would trust Naruto's judgement on this since he was always better at judging character than she was thanks to his Empathy ability... there was nobody to this date that could hide their emotions from Naruto, the only possible way for somebody to defeat his ability was to simply not have emotions to sense in the first place.\n\nAnother reason she wanted Asia was that Unique Level Sacred gear that Asia had, the Twilight Healing was the only known Sacred Gear with the power to heal beings from any race, and could heal almost any wound. The best part was that Asia already had an amazing amount of control and experience with her Sacred Gear. Her Sacred Gear would be a major boon when she eventually faced of against Riser, who had healing powers of his own, and his sister with her own healings powers. Having somebody that could heal people on her side would be a great asset, and she would be able to have the bragging rights of gaining another Sacred Gear user with great potential.\n\nIssei's Twice Critical had been a let down, but she didn't regret gaining him into her peerage after she had seen the hidden potential in him. Of course, he wouldn't be so much of a front line fighter as he would be an out of the box fighter... the results of his training with Akeno in the magical arts had prodused some... strange results in the form of a move that would greatly help her in battle so long as they were facing off against people that cared about their modesty.\n\nWhat did he call that move? Oh yeah, she was pretty sure Issei named his first original move the Dress Break. Akeno could attest to the fact that it had worked when they had been practicing it, and it stripped away anything that the victim was wearing... clothes, armor, ropes, and even certain types of magic enhancements covering the body. It was a great move, but she was concerned about Issei abusing the move every chance he got. While it would greatly distract female opponents, she had a feeling that Issei would refuse to use it against men even if ordered to do it.\n\n'Why do I get the feelings I forget to tell Rias something?' Naruto thought as he considered the situatiuon Asia was in, not really caring what she picked so long as she was happy with her choice. He knew that he had forgotten to tell Rias about something, but for the life of him he couldn't remember what he had forgotten... did he ever tell Rias that Issei's Sacred Gear had been a Boosted Geat instead of Twice Critical... yeah, he was almost 50 percent sure that he had mentioned it to her... okay, maybe around 30 percent sure.\n\n\"Thank you for the offer, but I don't think I want to be a devil.\" Asia said with a bow as she rejected the offer from Rias as politely as she could. She already have friends now, so there was no reason for her to turn into a devil when she had the choice not to.\n\n\"I see... will you please hold out your hand for me then Asia-san?\" Rias requested just as politely to the younger girl, and Asia nodded and let Rias take her hand and place the tip of her well manmaged fingernails into the center of her palm. Rias didn't show it on the outside, but she was rather annoyed that Asia didn't chose to join her, but she would get over it. What she was doing now would still benefit both parties, and allow Asia to stay with them even if she was a human. Akeno decided to explain what Rias was doing to Asia when she saw the confused expression on the nun's face.\n\n\"Buchou is placing a a magic symbol on her hand that will allow you to use the Gremory Transportation circle, and allow you to start trying to learn magic using the Gremory seal as the base. This way you can at least grow stronger to defend yourself, and use the same magic circle as us to move around.\" Akeno described the benefits of what Rias was doing to Asia, something that the blonde haired girl greatly appreciated. Naruto himself nodded in approval over Rias choice in allowing Asia to use her families magic seal and teleportation circle, because that proved that she trusted his judgement of Asia's character.\n\n'I think they forgot about us.' Katase thought with a small sweat drop doing down the side of her head when she realized that everyone was focused on Asia at the moment. Murayama placed a hand on her shoulder, and Katase smiled lightly and understood the hidden message. Compared to the others, they were kind of plain and forgettable... not they they weren't pretty, but they just didn't have any sort of charm that set them apart from the rest of the school besides their devil status. The Sacred Gear holders had that that set them apart, and Gasper had his 'Absolute Territory' thing going for him with how he cross dressed in the girl's school uniform at all times... for those that don't know, the Absolute Territory in the skin showing between stocking and a skirt, the small amount of thigh showing was part of Gasper's strange charm.\n\nKalawarner had her mature teacher thing going for her now, while Blaze had his bad boy rebel attitude and weapon fetish. Yuuto was the handsome 'prince' type that gathered a lot of attention, and had a whole base of fangirls in the school, so he got load's more attention than they did... also understandable.\n\nAkeno was a boobytastic bombshell of sex appeal, and her traditional japanese looks made her a classic beauty. Her breasts and hips made her one of the sexiest girls in the school, with only Rias herself being above her with her more exotic red hair and slightly smaller chest when compared top Akeno. Not to mention she had the mysterious vibe going for her, and the unreachable princess thing that made her almost almost impossible to approach without feeling nervous.\n\nNaruto and Koneko were the Twin Mascots of the school, the first years with the most potential and the greatest looks for their year. Naruto was the school's Handsome Shota, while Koneko was the Blank Faced Loli... their were the two halves of the same coin. The emotional and expressive Naruto, and the emotionless and unexpressing Koneko. Their greatest appeal was when they were together, but even without each other they had great levels of appeal.\n\nKatase actually felt HAPPY that Issei was in the Club with them, because now they had somebody that had even less appeal than they did. Issei was the schools hated pervert, with very few giving him a chance even though the two of them had learned that Issei was a rather good person. The tw3o of them had nothing 'special' about them other than their sword skills, and there was an entire club of girls with sword skills.\n\nNow their was the 'pure nun' type of girl that was more than likely the clumsy type that would make everyone want to help her. With her attractive blond hair and exotic eyes, she would be an instant hit among the others in the school.\n\n'Seriously, it was like this club was MADE for people with high appeal levels... I feel a little left out.' Murayama thought with a light chuckle in her own head when she remembered that out of everyone in the club, Issei was the only one with less appeal than them. It was kind of sad actually, for Issei that is. They were glad to have somebody that appealed to the public even less than they did.\n\nThen there was the person that they didn't count as a member of the club because the girl was home schooled, Kyokan the giant beauty with breasts larger than Akeno's. A person that stood far above even the tallest of guys in the school. They had never seen a person as tall as Kyokan was, and her biggest charm was that she looked even taller when she stood next to either Naruto or Koneko, which enhanced her charm by a factor of three easily.\n\nMurayama and Katase booth hoped that Issei didn't gain any more appeal than they did, otherwise they would be embarrassed.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n_Peerage List _  \n_Rias Gremory - King_  \n_Naruto Toujou - Queen_  \n_Koneko Toujou / Akeno Himejima - Rook_  \n_Gasper Vladi / Kalawarner - (M)Bishop and Bishop_  \n_Yuuto Kiba / Blaze bolding - Knight_  \n_Issei Hyoudou / Katase Muromi / Murayama Yurika - Pawn_  \n_Number In Peerage - 11 (Counting Rias)_  \n_(M) Stands for Mutated_\n\n\n\t28. Chapter 28 Phenex appears\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter  \nPrologue to the Riser Arc, and another huge change will appear.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"This is a very... strange request of you to make Lord Phenex, are you sure that this will be a smart idea. I can't find that Rias will be very happy about it.\" The father a Rias Gremory stated as he rubbed the red stubble on his chin. Lord Gremory was a very handsome man with red hair the same as his children, and much like his children a warm smile was almost always seen on this man's face. In his hands was the recently modified marrage agreement for his own daughter and the third son of the Phenex family, something that he had agreed to many years ago before the Nekoshou boy had explained a better way to do this by having Rias and Riser fight in a Rating Game when the time comes and Rias gains a certain number to her peerage to make things even.\n\n\"Yes, and I find this odd as well... but my youngest came to me with this idea. Our families both have many great things about them. The Gremory magic library is the mosty vast library in the entire Underworld, and my own family in the most wealthy family because of our production of Phoenix Tears and natural abilities.\" Lord Phenex, a blond haired male in his middle ahged years stated with a small smile at the idea that his youngest had brought to his attention, and the small twinkle in his blue eyes showed how proud he was of his youngest stepping up and showing the courage to go against him and request a modification to the original marraige contract.\n\n\"I see... and this revised contract is too insure that even if your son loses, that our families will be able to form a bond that will create a stable alliance between us. If your son should lose, Rias won't be the party getting married. If she wins, she and your son will continue with the original marraige proposal... but I do have to question to new addition to the contract.\" Lord Gremory asked his fellow High-Class Devil as he placed a slim finger to the newer additions to the contract between them. The contract that would give their families and iron clad alliance where thye could make equal and fair exchanges of goods and knowledge. Originally, both sides had just wanted equal access to certain parts of each others abilities and strong Heirs to their Clans one day with both of their families powers, but now they would agree to the exhance of Tears and Knowledge from their library.\n\nThis would be the result of the newer side of the agreement though, to which Lord Gremory was refering when he was pointing out the new addition.\n\n\"Before I answer, please answer me this. Should anything happen to your child Rias, and grandchild what would you do for a heir... this is no threat. This is just as curious question to prove a point.\" Lord Phenex stated when he realized that his words could be taken as a threat to the Heirs of the Gremory, so he had to make it known that he was not making a move against the Heirs with his words. Lord Gremory nodded, because this was a question that he had been asked a few times in the past few years.\n\n\"You bring up a good point, and if such a thing were to happen then I would be forced to pick a new Heir to my family from my daughter's peerage since they are her direct servants and have the highest connection to the title... I would have to say Naruto-san would be picked because of his status as the Queen and his non-human background. The Queen is the second in command of a peerage, so it only makes sense to pick him... and because he a Yokai turned Yokai/Devil he would be fit to lead the Gremory... why do you ask?\" Lord Gremory questioned in return truthfully. It has happened a few times in the past where a family would be unable to produce heirs to their title, so their late chidren's Queen's would be placed in the position of Heir to the family until such a time a new blood Heir can be produced to take their place. The Queen of a peerage are the strongest member of the peerage, and they had the deepest connection to the High-Class Devil they serve. Of course, this was only the case with Queens that were either Demons or Devils before becoming a Queen. A Human of Fallen Angel turned Devil would be passed over for the title in fear that the family would lose their Pillar status.\n\n\"In the case that Riser does lose, and there is a real chance of that, my youngest daughter has brought up the point that our families should still be able to form some kind of alliance with each other. In the place of the Heir's of our families, the marraige will take place between the Back-up Heirs. Young Naruto and my daughter will replace Riser and Rias in the contract, and their marraige will be the bond that strengthens the alliance between our families... the young Nekoshou has been quickly rising through the ranks in record time, and the marraige to Ravel will only speed that up with his current rank being just under High Class.\" Lord Phenex explained the idea behind the losing conditions very clearly. The reasons that he had been all for the idea his daughter had brought up was for the fact that the Nekoshou were demons, also known as Yokai, with impressive powers that had the power to negate his families Immortality... it was better to have that power for your family and use it to make future generations gain a higher resistance than make enemies with it. The Nekoshou Senjutsu and Youjutsu were very respected and feared powers thanks to their ability to strike directly at the life force of the Phenex and negate their healing, and the Youjutsu could be custom made against them.\n\nHe agreed with his daughter... and wife apparently, when they had brought up that the potential for a reincarnated Queen from the Nekoshou with those powers would make him grandchildren with potential out of this world. Grandchildren with the potential to all have Senjutsu, Youjutsu, Immortality of the Phoenix, Pyrokinesis, Aerokinesis, high reserves of magic, and with the alliance with children would be able to learn advances magics from the Gremory library.\n\nNaruto was already at the edge of becoming a High Class Devil, so nobody would be truly against the marraige between Naruto and Ravel should Riser lose his Rating Game against Rias. Naruto's status as Queen of Rias' peerage was a strong enough bond to the Gremory that he could be used as a viable candidate for the marraige contract that would bind their families.\n\nNot to mention that from first glance his daughter had been rather taken with the youngest living Nekoshou when they had met during a meeting between Lord Gremory and Lord Phenex a few years back when they had been having a meeting over the contract. It helped when their was an attraction between the parties involved... and unlike with Rias and Riser, Naruto doesn't seem to hate Ravel like Rias does Riser. That was a great boon as well to the bonding process, and with the paper already written up and signed by him all he would need is Lord Gremory's signature and the final agreement would be finished.\n\nIf Riser beat Rias, then the two of them would be getting married to bond the families... but if Rias beat Riser, then Naruto and Ravel would be the cementing force that bound the families together.\n\n\"I see, and I undertsand the points you bring up. I think this idea is a very acceptable one, and the terms are both fair and equal. The exchange of Phoenix Tears for access to our library is something that I can allow... yes, I fully agree to this.\" Lord Gremory stated as he used the pen to poke the tip of his finger and got a little of his blood on the pen. Writing his name in blood on the document was the very next thing he did without so much as a hesitation, and frankly this was the servant his his daughter, giving him almost as much authority over him as Rias has. This agreement would promise that both families would be able to get something out of this, win or lose for Rias their families would be able to retain their status and gain even more power than before.\n\nYes, this was a good agreement from a political stand point, but Lord Gremory did feel bad that he was forcing somebody else into a marraige.\n\n\"Very well then, I thank you for agreeing to my daughter's request... and now onto other matters. I have gotten a recent report that your daughter now has the tenth member added to her peerage... that is the same number we recently agreed to before the date would be set.\" Lord Phenex stated fairly, and Lord Gremory nodded lightly with a frown on his face. Yes, instead of just setting a date, they had both agreed that until Rias had ten members to her peerage they would wait for the decision on when the Rating Game would be, and he knew that Rias had not been told that at her tenth peerage member she would be forced into decreasing the time before the Rating Game as per another agreement on not telling either fighters about the member limit.\n\n\"The Rating Games will take place... in eleven days. I will send somebody to inform Rias of the Rating Game, and I expect that you will do the same for Riser. I believe a ten day training period before the Rating Games will be fair... your son does have much more experience than my daughter, and the most accurate results for this game of potential will be shown if Rias can come at your son at full power... don't you agree?\" Lord Gremory wondered to his fellow Lord, and Lord Phenex nodded with a small smile on his face at how soon things were going to come along.\n\n\"Yes, a small training period would promise better results... I agree to this time period being used, but in response the wedding will take place five days after the Rating Game, no matter the outcome.\" Lord Phenex stated something that he would admit to wanting to be done as soon as possible. He wanted his hands on the blood of the Nekoshou and the magic library of the Gremory, and either outcome would get him one of those things, or both of them... he was actually hoping that his son lost this Rating Game.\n\nImmortality, Senjutsu, Chakra, Touki, Magic, Youjutsu, Fire and Wind abilities, and the other secret abilities of the Phenex and the Nekoshou.\n\nSuch a grandchild with these abilities would be another great boon to his clan's fame, even if they would be unable to become the Heir to the family with the current Heir being Ruval.\n\n'I wonder son, how are you going to handle this?' Lord Phenex thought wit a light smirk on his face when he got up and excused himself from the room so that he may return home to tell Riser of the decided date for the Rating Game.\n\nThings were starting to heat up in the Underworld.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**The Riser Arc has officially begun!**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t29. Chapter 29 The News\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Guy's Night, Guy's Night, tonight is gonna be a Guy's Night nya.\" Naruto sang very lightly as he and Koneko walked into the clubroom together for the day. Koneko was smiling very lightly at how Naruto was excited for Guy's Night like he always was, the chance to hang out with only the guys for once was something that Naruto always looked forward to... the chance to spend a night with your bros, not having to worry about pleasing any women and acting proper around them... not that he did that last one anyway unless he was at school. Koneko was happy that Naruto had friends to spend a night with like this, and she was actually thankful for this night that she didn't have to worry about a girl stealing her brother away without even asking her permission before seducing her bro.\n\n\"Dance with me Naruto, Gasper!\" Yuuto greeted Naruto as he tossed the shorter boy a pair of sunglasses out of nowhere, and jumping through the air Naruto used his face to catch the sunglasses in a way that he was able to put them on while flying through the air. Naruto landed right next to Yuuto at the same time that Gasper jumped out of his box and landed next to Naruto with sunglasses already on his face, but for a different reason.\n\nThis was somehwat of a tradition between them, before they would go on Guy's Night they would get ready by being a little more fun loving for the day. Kind of a way to prepare for the craziness that was goinjg to happen in the night. They all kind of held back their guy sides when they were surrounded by so many girls out of instinct, so tonight they would let out their repressed manlyness and stupidity so that they could have the most epic night of the month... Naruto had also secretely timed this night so that they could go places where they couldn't normally now that the teleportation circle was even stronger than it normally was, and it would look like they would have to include a new member of the Guy's Night experience since Issei was going to come as well.\n\n\"Oh brother, not this song again.\" Rias commented dryly when the three boy's corssed their a arms and leaned slightly to the side when the beat of the song filled up the room. Issei honestly felt left out when they all three in unison started to nod their heads in perfect sync, showing that they either practiced this, or they were just that good at being in sync with each other at a moments notice. Issei blinked when he realized that music was playing, before he saw that Koneko was sitting on the couch with a boombox in her lap with the button already pressed.\n\n\"Oppan Gangnam-style...\" Naruto started out with a smirk on his face, before he started ot nod his head again when Gasper lifted his head up with a shy smirk on his face next. Issei was honestly conflicted by the fact that when Gasper bounced his leg up and down like Naruto and Yuuto, his panties... yes panties, slightly showed each time.\n\n\"Gangnam-style.\" Gasper stated the next part and they all changed from their current nodding and leg hoping to a new position, before the music stopped when the boombox started to make the sound of static, showing that something in it eiyther broke, or Koneko didn't want to hear the song either and decided to break the boombox. She wouldn't be the only one that didn't like that song, because Kalawarner and Katase both seemed like they would have prefered that the song not be playing, even if it would have been funny to see the three boys start to dance to the song in sync while singing along with the song itself.\n\n'I totally feel left out already.' Issei thought with a raised eyebrow and nervous chuckle when he considered that maybe he shouldn't go along with them. He was the new guy after all, so it didn't seem right that he intrude on their Guy's Night when he hadn't even been with the group all that long. It was kind of like he was intruding on a sacred tradition for these guys, even if Gasper wasn't really dressed like a boy to begin with, making the Guy's Night kind of awkward.\n\n\"Guy's Night already?\" Akeno asked in surprise when she came into the room with a graceful gaze upon her face when she looked at the boys and how they seemed to be let down by the fact that the Guy's Night boombox was broken. They cheered up at the sound of her voice, before Naruto pointed at Akeno with a smile on his face. He didn't need the boombox to say what he was going to say right now, but it would have been funnier if the music had been playing when he said what he was going to say.\n\n\"Eeeeeeey sexy lady!\" Naruto was the one that sang one of his favorite lines, before the three guys stopped their dancing again when in the middle of the room a white magical teleportation circle appeared out of nowhere. Everyone that knew who used that circle couldn't help but blink with the curiousity on the fact that Grayfia had decided to come here earlier than she said she would be coming. While Naruto's hands flew to his butt and he jumped on the couch next to Koneko for some extra behind protection, knowing that this was a very real chance that Grayfia was just coming to deliver the spanking earlier than she had told Rias she would be here. Naruto couldn't help but gulp in a justified amount of fear when he remembered what happened to his bottom the time he had dyed Grayfia's hair purple.\n\n\"Crap, it seems like Guy's Night isn't going to happen tonight... and I was looking forward ot the strip club.\" Yuuto said with a light laugh when he saw Issei's face light up like the 4th of July when he mentioned that tonight they were going to a strip club. Of course, Koneko looked at Naruto with a raised eyebrow when she heard that fact, and he just shrugged at her.\n\n\"What, I had no idea about that one... anyway, I am sure that Yuuto was just teasing Issei.\" Naruto added at the end just when Grayfia finished entering the room through the use of her magic circle. Naruto quickly made himself as small as possible to avoid her gaze on him, and by that he meant that he was currently moved so that his head was now hiding in Koneko's lap, with her hands petting him out of instinct, and with his eyes closed he pretended to be asleep.\n\n'So sexy... but also so cold.' Issei thought with a shiver when he unknowingly started to hold his own breath when in the presence of the powerful woman now in the room with them. He was stunned by the silver haired and silver eyed beauty in front of him, but before he could do anything he felt Gasper tug on his sleeve, so bending down to Gasper's level the Dhampire boy decided that it would be best to warn Issei ahead of time.\n\n\"Issei-san, that is Grayfia... Buchou's sister-in-law and the Strongest Queen... if you value your life, don't make her mad.\" Gasper warned, before the boy 'eeped' when Grayfia turned her eyes to him, and his instant responce to the gaze of the Queen was to run as fast as he could and jumped onto the same couch as Naruto, and grab onto the also scared white haired boy for support. Naruto jolted at the fact that Gasper jumped on top of him, before he blinked when he realized that Grayfia's annoyance wasn't at any of them right now.\n\n\"Do not fret, I come here on official business. I simply have a message for Ojou-sama and Naruto-kun. Your punishment has been postponed for the moment Naruto-kun, since a situation has called for you to be at your best soon.\" Grayfia explained when she felt that the reason that Naruto wasn't acting normal was the fact that he was expecting her to be here for the reason of punishing him for his earlier rebellion. Naruto sighed, before he sweat dropped when he realized that Gasoer was pretty much trying to squeeze the life out of him from behind, and with an eye twitch Naruto pushed the boy off of him and onto the seat in the couch next to him.\n\n\"Some tea Grayfia-sama?\" Akeno offered with a small, but nervous, smile on her face when she offered a plate filled with tea cups to the grown woman in front of them. Grayfia nodded her head very slowly before taking one of the cups offered to her, before she moved out of the center of the room and closer to Rias.\n\n\"Thank you, and I wish I could come under better conditions. Ojou-sama, the day you are wiating for had drawn near. With your recent additions to your peerage, you have been deemed ready for your Rating Game with Riser-sama to commence. You have been given an eleven day training period in which you can sharpen your skills.\" Grayfia informed Rias, and the girl's eyes closed and she nodded in acceptance. At this point, she was sure that her peerage as it was would be more than enough to take care of Riser's peerage while she and Naruto took out Riser while the peerage was distracted with them, or just outright defeated by her peerage. She had nothing to fear anymore with the more recent, and violent, addition to her peerage. Blaze could weild his holy swords, a major boon to her, and Kalawarner had many years of battle experience with her Holy Element and Light Spears, a weakness to devils.\n\n\"Thank you-\" Rias started, before Grayfia interupted her before she could properly thank the elder woman for delivering the information.\n\n\"There is more Ojou-sama, your father and Lord Phenex had made a change to the contract. If you are to win, then like before you will not have to marry Riser-sama.\" Grayfia informed without any emotion, but she sent a small look of pity to the confused Naruto when he noticed that the air around Grayfia was tense, and the woman's emotions were leaning towards pure anger. He wasn't sure what had made Grayfia angry just by remembering it, but that calm look on her face was just for show right now, because underneath her pretty skin was a volcano waiting to explode. He was sure that she had learned something recently that was of great annoyance to her, and she was trying to not appear angry in front of Rias, but he was very curious.\n\n\"Buchou is... shutting up now.\" Issei said with his hands raised in surrender when he realized that everyone was sending him the shut up look at how tense the room was getting. He knew when to shut up, but sometimes he just didn't listen to when his brain was telling to to keep his mouth shut. In his defence, since becoming a devil he recently felt that he could mouth off a bit more about what he was thinking. Yeah, he was surprised Rias was going to be married if she didn;t win this Rating Game thing, but that wasn't what seemed to concern Rias right now.\n\n\"As I had been previously saying, the condition that you will not have to mary Riser-sama has not been changed, but the Lords of your families think that the alliance between the Phenex and Gremory is too important to be made or broken based on the outcome of your match. To correct this, no matter what happens, the alliance will be formed... just with different marraige participants.\" Grayfia informed Rias and her peerage... and Asia apparently when she came into the room a few moments later and noticed how tense everything had gotten. Rias linked her hands together and started to think of somebody that the Phenex family would be able to suggest that her father would be able to accept... her nephew was out of the question because of his father being one of the Four Satans, and she was already out because of what would happen should she lose. She would admit, that now she was confused when she remembered that there were no other Gremory that would be able to take the marraige for her should she win.\n\n\"... No.\" Rias whispered when she remembered that it had become custom for the Queen of the current heir to gain the title of heir should the true heir die with no other heir being available... her Queen was Naruto, and because of his demonic lineage he was more than qualified for the position of heir, and somebody that the Phenex could ask for as a party in the contract. With his quickly rising status as a devil, they must believe that he would become a High Class Devil soon, and it wasn't much of a stretch for her to believe that they were after his Nekoshou abilities to boost their own.\n\n\"Spit it out already, what poor soul is going to have to marry into the Phenex family nya. Oh, getting into a family of grilled chickens is pretty bad.\" Naruto tried to lighten the mood with some light joking over the matter, and Grayfia felt amused for half a second when she realized how ironic it was for Naruto to say those words.\n\n'... My General is such an idiot when it comes to this kind of stuff.' Blaze thought with a small smile on his face at how idiotic Naruto could be when he wasn't using his brain for fighting or planning for a fight... or training for a fight. He thought it was both amusing and horrible that somebody was playing with Naruto's future, but he also saw how this could benefit Naruto in the end.\n\n'Are they talking about Naruto?' Issei thought with a slight frown on his face when he realized that he wasn't completely sure, but with the glances in Naruto's direction it seemed likely that they were talking about him.\n\n'This isn't funny.' Akeno thought with a serious frown on her face when she realized the hidden agenda of what the Phenex clan was doing with their actions. They were making sure that Naruto, the biggest threat to Riser and Ravel in the Rating Game, would not be able to fight at his best, and at the same time putting him up against Rias as well. They were making Naruto pick between Rias and himself, because if he helps Rias and they win, then he will be forced into a marraige in which he doesn't love the other person, but if he doesn't try his hardest and leaves Rias to her own then Rias will most likely be getting married in the same fashion. A marraige where only the one from the Phenex clan will find any enjoyment from the bonding. They were forcing Naruto to hesitate in ehlping Rias, because if he did then he was placing her far above himself and screwing himself over. Not only that, but they were obviously after the powers hidden in his blood, and the reason Nekoshou were a feared race before their fall into near extinction.\n\nNaruto was basically being told to help Rias and doom himself, or not help her and force her into the same situation that he was trying to avoid by not helping her.\n\n\"What... why is everyone staring at me like I am an idiot nya?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow when he realized that everyone in the club but Koneko was staring at him, but her hands seemed to be shaking pretty badly so it must be something pretty bad.\n\n'He... really doesn't get it.' Katase thought with a small chuckle inside her own head, while Murayama shock her head in amusement at how he seemed to be the only person in the room that didn't seem to get it... wait, Asia seemed to be in the dark as well, but she hadn't been reading up on the laws of the Underworld like some of them have.\n\n\"You are a dumbass, they are talking about YOU. You will be getting married if the red haired girl wins this Rating Game. What kind of... shutting up now.\" Kalawarner stated when she noticed the look of absolute death that Blaze was sending her for the way she was talking to Naruto, and his loyalty shined through when his death glare seemed to be even more potent than it normally was when he used it on his brothers to get them to go to bed on the days that his mother was out of the house.\n\n\"Stop talking, just stop.\" Blaze said warningly, before everyone heard the door SLAM shut so hard that cracks started ot form on the walls. The doorknob was completley destroyed from the force that Naruto had yanked the door closed, and everyone had to wince at both the sound, and how he must be taking the bad news.\n\n\"I am going after him.\" Koneko stated to Rias, before she gave Asia a light look and nodded to her in acceptance of her coming along as well. Naruto didn't have his collar right now, so he was going to be prone to other people's emotions now, and he was running out of the safe haven of the clubroom. Asia smiled for a very brief moment at how Koneko seemed to be warming up to him, but Koneko didn't get far when Akeno grabbed her wrist and held the back of sia's shirt.\n\n\"Stay, he most likely needs to be alone... this is worrying news. He is going to want time to think on this.\" Akeno said with a gentle look on her face, and zero of her sadistic tendencies coming through with her words.\n\n\"Yes, please stay... I know how it feels to be told you might have a loveless marraige. I wanted to be alone when I was told, so please consider this before trying to go after him. Blaze, I know you aren't loyal to me, but this is for Naruto-kun's benefit.\" Rias explained with a light look towards Blaze, but she blinked when she noticed that he hadn't even made a move from his spot against the wall, but the frown on his face was an obvious indicater to his emotions.\n\n\"I wasn't planning on going after him, and even if I was going I am not good at emotional stuff... if it doesn't have anything to do with weapons or fighting, I am not very much help. I agree with you though on your point, he might want to be alone... of course, he might need somebody to hold him right now.\" Blaze said with a sly look to Asia, knowing that his words would cause a reaction in the now blushing girl. He did have a point though, because while sometimes a man needed to be alone, there were times when he needed a woman by his side to help him through his problems.\n\n\"Not helping.\" Koneko commented with a twitching eye before she took a deep breath and sat back down on the couch, and since she and Naruto lived together if he needed her then she would be there for him then.\n\n\"Back to important matters, Ojou-sama, the other party of the contract if you should win is Ravel-sama. I suggest yoy start your peerage's training right away. Lord Gremory and Lord Phenex have made the playing field even by ordering Riser-sama from spying on you, or having any contact with you or your peerage until the Rating Game. You should use this chance to increase your chances of winning.\" Grayfia suggested without any emotion in her tone to indicate if these were her real feelings on the matter or not, but Rias grimaced when she realized that now if she won the game she was damning her best friend to a loveless marraige.\n\nThis wasn't fair, she could save herself, or save Naruto.\n\n\"You can leave now Grayfia, your message has been delivered. I need time to think on what I have heard now. Akeno, please take everyone to _that_ house for some training.\" Rias ordered to her more powerful Rook, and Akeno nodded with a slight grimace when she moved to the middle of the room after Grayfia teleported back to wherever she had come from before coming here. The rest of Rias' peerage went on top of the red magic circle with Akeno as they were teleported away from their current location, while Asia sat awkwardly in the same room as a thinking Rias.\n\nShe silently left the room to go find Naruto, and Rias didn't even try to stop her, because frankly she had no real power over Asia unless she was threatening to kill the girl... something that would piss off Naruto so much.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next to be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t30. Chapter 30 Venting\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Suggested Youtube Video: NarutoXShion AMV - Until the Day I Die (Seriously, I liked this video)**_  \n_**New Poll: Who will be the Third and FINAL Naruto character brought into this story? **_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Ryaaaaaaaaaah!\" The sounds a angry screaming could be heard ringing through out the entire woods around them, with every single animal in hearing distance getting the hell out of their when they all sensed a powerful and angry predater in the woods with them. Birds few out of the trees in fear, and started to fly towards the sky as quickly as possible to avoid the creature that would devour them at first chance. The birds weren't the only ones going away, because moments later a few bears were seen running out of the woods when for the first time they too felt like they were being hunted by a bigger, badder killer. No animal even had the arrogance to believe they were safe, or to try and kill the creature creating such hateful and destructive sounds.\n\nEven more so when there was a loud explosion that rang out through the woods, and the shockwaves from the explosion made the trees around the woods sway violently. Another roar was heard, and the trees started to lose their leaves over the winds and stress that was beaing place on them. Blue flames started to spout into the sky like a whale spouting water, before the were snuffed out before they could reach a height that they would be noticed by people in the city. The sounds of crunching were heard, before trees started to fall down one after the other in response to every crunch that was heard.\n\n\"Wow... he hasn't thrown a temper tantrum like this in a long time nya.\" Kuroka commented with a raised eyebrow as she started to walk into the forest that she knew Naruto would be venting his frustrations in. She had come to the city the moment that she had been informed by Grayfia that more likely then not Naruto would be getting married to somebody should Rias win her Rating Game. A tree crashed into the ground nearby her, and she sweat dropped lightly when she saw that it had been sent flying a good distance with his half of the tree was dug into the ground when it landed. Oh yeah, Naruto really wasn't taking the news very well that he might be having to get married. Of course, she knew that this was a very real possibility... and sadly she approved of the contract as well.\n\nCall her a bad sister, but this contract would only speed up the process in which more Nekoshou would be born. Naruto getting married was something that she would have rather done without, but if he just had sex with random women and got them pregnant then that would be a bigger slight on their races fearsome reputation. It wasn't that she was happy about this, really, she was furious with what was happening right now. She was just very mature when it came to knowing what was good for your race, and what was good for a person. Kuroka had to jump over a flying tree that started to soar in her direction while thinking about the situation, because she could honestly say she didn't fault Naruto one bit for being angry with what was happening.\n\nShe would be furious as well, but she also knew that this was a real possibility for the future when she had given her siblings away to the Gremory family. Heck, she was furious right now, and had TOLD Sirzechs that she would be taking a day off to go to her brother. She didn't taken no for an answer, which she didn't have to because Sirzechs was just as surprised as her when he had heard about the newest addition to the contract. Sirzechs wasn't happy about this either, not when he had invested so much time trying to get Rias and Naruto together... or the fact that Naruto was like the little brother he had always wanted. Sirzechs wasn't just a siscon, he was also a brocon... he was the entire fetish package when it came to younger siblings.\n\nKuroka was completely conflicted on this, because on one hand it wasn't like Naruto hated Ravel... she was pretty sure that Ravel and Ruval were the two Phenex siblings that Naruto could stand. Ruval was the eldest child of the Phenex, and next in line for the title of Heir, while Ravel was the youngest and the farthest away from the title. Each of them were the two Phenex children that Naruto could get along with to a certain degree.\n\n\"Ryaaaaaaaaah! Why! Do! I! Have! To! Chose!?\" Naruto frustrated shouting could be heard very close by now, and Kuroka sighed at how badly he was taking the news now that he knew about the change to the contract. At least Rias had years to accept the possibility of having to marry Riser if she lost, but Naruto was only given a few weeks before he could be married to Ravel. Now he had to pick bwteen his promise of helping Rias get out of her marraige, and stop himself from getting married. She knew her little brother, and Naruto was the kind of person that never went back on his words just becuase things would turn out worse for him if he kept his word. He would damn himself if it meant his friends could be happy, so Kuroka knew without a shadow of a doubt that Naruto was going to fight his damn hardest against Riser in the Rating Game just so that Rias could one day marry somebody that she loved... even if he would have to psuck it up and get married because of his choice. It was why Naruto was her pride and joy, because he was such a pure hearted person most of the time that he would place others above himself without fail.\n\nOf course, Kuroka was once again surprised when she finally found Naruto in the woods. She blinked when she came upon a seen that she would have to admit that she was curious about, instead of just Naruto standing there throwing a tantrum over something he had no choice in, right now she came upon the sight of Naruto surrounded by dozens of copies of himself. She stayed hidden for a moment, even though she knew for a fact that Naruto knew that she was there because of his sensing ability.\n\n\"Huff... huff... huff... RYAAAAAAAAAAH!\" Naruto roared out after panting, and Kuroka was almost blown back when Naruto's shout became super enhanced by his own powerful energy. She winced when her ears started to bleed at the pitch of the sound growing higher and higher, until it sounded just like a metalic bell sound ringing in her ears. The clones around Naruto were all blown back by the energy wave that was sent in every direction out of Naruto's body, a blue wave of energy was sent in every direction in response to the sound of his voice... the ground itself began to crack as stones started to levitate in response to his rising power. Kuroka jumped back before the wave could hit her, and it faded away once it got too far away from Naruto's body.\n\nShe blinked when all of the clones that had been here upon her arrival went up in smoke before vanishing into nothing, showing that while they were real, they could only take maybe one good hit before vanishing. Her expert energy tracking let her sense as all the energy left in the clones went rushing back to Naruto's body, refilling his own impressive reserves of power that surpassed her reserves in size and potency alone. He was abusing the hell out of those reserves as he vented, because Kuroka's eyes widened when an angry Naruto clapped his hands together and with massice buildup of his power her vision was completely clouded by smoke, and she hid deeper in the shadows when she felt Naruto's energy signature split and multiply to larger numbers than she had witnessed before.\n\n\"Onee-chan?\" She heard one of many voices ask her out loud, and when the smoke cleared she was treated to the sight of what was possibly hundreds of Naruto's surrounding her on all sides. They were everywhere, and littered the ground to the point that this entire section of the woods was filled to the brim his Narutos. They were even hanging from the tree branches by their legs as most of them seemed to be waiting for something now that the smoke cleared, and Kuroka didn't have to wonder what they were waiting for when many of the clones started to jump down and run at Naruto... with only a fraction of Naruto's physical abilities it would seem.\n\n'So... he can clone himself, but they can't use his Queen enhancements. They are physical copies instead of illusions like mine, but they seem to vanish with a single hit... but they can pack a punch as well.' Kuroka thought in interest when she saw the original Naruto did sent flying when one of the clones slugged him in the face, before five of them jumped above the enraged Naruto and slammed their feet into the top of his skull hard enough to smash his face into the ground in what must have been a painful blow... even without the Queen enhacements these clones weren't easy pickings pickings when they outnumbered you... 409 to 1. She blinked when a few clones grouped together and started to hold their hands apart as blue flames shaped like cartoon cat heads formed in the air between their palms. She blinked hwen instead of throwing the attack like she had believed the clones would do, all of the clones with flame heads in their hands slamed their palms into the flames and used their Youjutsu skills to protect them as the flames surrounded their arms up to the middle of the forearm.\n\nWhat were once raging infernos that were shaped like cartoonish cats, were now in the shape of the lion's heads coating the clones fists.\n\n\"We like to try and recreate the moves we see in these weird dreams the boss gets... I think the dream called that the Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist nya... lions are cats, so he spent a few monthes trying to figure out how to make it.\" The clones next to her informed her in a calm tone of voice, showing that Naruto's anger didn't transfer over to his clones. The clones surged forward to Naruto with their flaming fists ready to punch the ever living hell out of Naruto, before the original of the group formed a misty bubble in his palm and slammed it into the ground to cover himself in a cloud of ddust and mist. The clones that had charged forward stopped themselves from enterning the clouded area, before they all felt a surge of power from inside the dust... the answer to what made that surge came second later when dozens of flaming blue mice surged out of the cloud and exploded into three times as many mice that chased the retreating clones through the air before catching up to a dozen of them and blowing up in explosion of blue flames that popped every clone they came in contact with.\n\nNaruto burst from the clearing dust and tackled one of the clones hard enough to pop it, before he ran on and punched two more in the faces and popped them as well. A hard look on his face as he vented his frustration through training, and because these were clones that littered the area he wouldn't have to worry about feeling their emotions... he couldn't even sense his clones emotions it would seem. Kuroka had to admit that she was impressed with how Naruto was making moves in his dreams, and then bringing them to life in the waking world.\n\n\"Flaming Red Bubbles of Super Amazing Ultra Epic Spicy Hotness!\" One of the clones shouted as he and the group he had formed created a dozen red bubbles with flames on the inside of them, before they each pointed at the original and sent the bubbles flying at him.\n\n\"Damnit! Stop trying to change the names of my attacks. They are called Blaze Bubbles you idiots, you are all horrible at naming things!\" Naruto shouted at his clones comically as he leaned back and almost danced around the bubbles to avoid getting hit by them, and he was happy he did because when the bubbles popped on the ground and trees the fire isndie them was released into the world and blew up almost anything that they touched. He didn't know how, but his clones seemed to be complete idiots when naming things. The names of attacked should be simply and easy to remember, and not something super long as hard to say. That name for the red bubbles the clones had suggested were just way to long for his taste.\n\n\"We are you!\" Most of the clones shouted back in response to being called idiots, and in his annoyance Naruto didn't see as a clone came from behind him and hooked his arms under his underarms and puled his arms into the air to restrain him long enough for the others to form an... and that plan failed before it could be started when Naruto jerked his head back and popped the clone by breaking it's nose. Naruto flipped into the air and rolled over a coming clone's shoulders when it tried to tackle him, before he used a claw to stab the clone in the back of the neck before landing on his feet and grabbing the extended fist of another clone and pulled on the clone of himself hard enough to lift the light weight clone in the air and use it as a weapon to pop two pother clones before it popped as well.\n\n\"I'm not nearly as stupid as to name something that long and hard to remember! You may be me, but you only have like a fifth of my brain power nya!\" Naruto shouted right back into the group of clones that he barged into next, and with his claws extended lightly he and the group of clones went toe to toe for mere seconds before he cut them down to zero. He blinked when five other clones were already withing striking range of him from various directions in the air around him, because it would appear they had used the smoke from the clones he defeated popping as the chance to jump out at him for surprise attacks. Naruto grinned and swung his arm with his Yokai forming a wave of wind energy around his arm from elbow to wrist, and with his blade of wind attached to his arm he c ut through four of the clones with ease, while the fifth used the deaths of the other four to give himself the time to jump nack and form a blade of wind on his arm as well before running at Naruto with the blade already extended.\n\nWith a light application of chakra, the clone surged with enough speed to match Naruto and was able to take the original by surprise just long enough to get a narrow cut on Naruto's shoulder before the original cut him down without mercy. Naruto looked down at the ground when he heard a rumble, before he jumped back just in time when a clones burst from the groun with his fist extended for a punch to the jaw. He was surprised when he was forced to dodge even more clones coming out of the ground with each step that he took, because no matter where he went they would just keep poppinhg from the ground to try and get him by surprise. All the clones that had already jumped form the ground popped and created a smokescreen just long enough for two clones to use this chance to make a surprise attack from the smokescreen and rush at Naruto with electricity sparking around their fingertips.\n\n\"Take this! Dual Lightning Bolt!\" The two clones stated as they pointed their magic covered fingers at Naruto, and he would have dodged them if a clone hadn't burst out of the ground and made him jump back to avoid a punch to the chin. He punched the clone in the face and popped it, but two strikes of lightning burst from the smoke cloud and knocked Naruto into a tree when his defencive skin took care of most of the damage, but the chest of his shirt was now slightly burnt and covered in light holes from the sparking electricity on him.\n\n\"Now that is a better name... Nekoshou's Evil Eye!\" Naruto said as he eyes became sparkling blue and he used his Charm in combination to trick an entire group of clones into looking into his eyes and falling under his illusion. Not even halve a second later the clones were popped froim extreme mental strain that came with being forced into a mindscape that you don't have. His eyes racked over another group that had been charging him, and they were forced into their own mindscapes as well and were popped under the instant mental strain. Naruto's eyes turned his yellowish hazel again before he did a backflip and kicked the two clones from earlier in the face when they charged at him. Naruto raised before he landed on the ground, and spinning in the air he increased his punching power when he shattered the ground he was about to land on and sent shards of stone piercing many of the clones in the area, with the crater being about around 50 feet long the clones didn't even stand a chance as about 200 of them were destroyed by flying rubble.\n\nNaruto huffed lightly when he landed on his feet, the amount of chakra he had been using today with his abuse of that earlier roar was starting to get too him.\n\nHe had been roaring opver and over again LONG before Kuroka had gotten here, and he had to admit that he was tired now that he had been abusing a rather energy costing move. Naruto took a deep breath as the remaining clones charged him, before he roared again and destroyed the rest of them with the powerful shockwaves his voice caused. Naurot stated to huff lightly, because unknown to Kuroka Naruto had been training for hours like this before she had shown up and started to spy on him. He was pretty much exhausted him his abuse of his large reserves. This had only been the latest batch of clones he had had battled against and defeated.\n\nKuroka nodded in approval when she noticed that Naruto didn't seem to be nearly as angry as he had been before, meaning that he had been able to work out some of his frustration at the situation on his own, a good trait for him to be able to use when he didn't want to hurt others because hew as angry and training his anger out.\n\nKuroka jumped down from the tree just in time to catch Naruto as he passed out and started to fall to the ground, this entire day having been an emotional rollar coster for her. Kuroka smiled lightly at the serene look on Naruto's face that was always there when he was asleep, before she kissed his forehead lightly.\n\n\"Don't worry Otouto, Onee-chan is going to try and see why this is happening nya.\" Kuroka told his sleeping face honestly, knowing that he would want to find out how and why this was happening before he could even begin to make a plan to get himself out of the bind he was in... even though Kuroka knew that getting out of an agreement like this was almost impossible. Of course, Kuroka beagn to carry Naruto back to his and Koneko's apartment with a smile on her face when she realized that with Naruto's luck something crazy would happen that nobody, not even he, would expect. Now... as Naruto's eldest sister she would going to have to put a little... scare in this Ravel girl to make sure that if she was getting hitched to Naruto, that she would treat him with the love and respect her deserved. If there was no way out of this, then she would make sure that her brother was as happy as possible with his wife, even if the marraige hadn't been for love at first.\n\nRight now though, she was going to wait until Naruto woke up and see how he was doing.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t31. Chapter 31 Pancake\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Warning: Fanservice in this chapter!**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Mmmm?\" Naruto started to slowly awaken from his much needed sleep after the emotional day he had yesterday, but in the half awake state Naruto was in his brain hadn't caught up with his body just yet. Right now the only thing on his mind was the fact that he was pretty sure that the gentle smell of delicious food wafting through the house at the moment. His body slowly rose out of bed, before his eyes began to lightly open and he looked around. Naruto first looked at his own bed and took the covers off and looked down at himself to see that he had been stripped down to his boxers at some point... what, just because he was small and cute didn't mean his underwear had to always reflect that. True, he prefered boxers with cats on them, but today he noticed that he was wearing his 'Guys Night' boxers... yes, he had a pair of boxers just for Guy's Night.\n\nHe looked around with a sleepy look on his face when he noticed that unlike all the other nights he had spent with Gasper and Yuuto after passing out at the end of Guy's Night right now he was atcually in his own room. Usually the three of them could be found passed out in the middle of an alley, sometimes in awkward positions or with explainable tattoos that Rias always ordered for them to get rid of them. Naruto could barely remember all the different tattoos he had after a Guy's Night. Naruto stood up and looked into the body length mirror in the corner of his room, before he gulped and pulled down his underwear slightly so that he could make sure he didn't have a tattoo on his ass... again. So far, he had once gotten two tattoos on his butt... one was of an EPIC tiger roaring. The second tattoo was a bit stranger, and it simply said _Bros For Life - NYG_, which Naruto understood as him getting a tattoo to show that he, Yuuto, and Gasper were bros. Yuuto had the same tattoo, but he actually still had it unlike Naruto and Gasper that had been told to get rip of theirs.\n\n'Okay, so no tattoo... oh right, there was no Guy's Night last night because of Grayfia's bad news. Man, that sucks... I was totally looking forward to a day without the girls.' Naruto thought with a small pout to his face when he pulled his boxers back up to fully cover himself again. It was always funny to see what condition they would be in when they all woke up from Guy's Night... they knew for a fact that Yuuto had lost his virginity to a hooker on Guy's Night about five monthes ago. Something that Naruto and Gasper promised Yuuto they wouldn't spread around, but they did secretely mock him in private over having to keep the fact that he had gotten crabs from the hooker a secret in the first place. Yuuto was without the crabs now, but watching him spend days trying to not scratch himself was amazingly funny.\n\nNaruto himself was the tattoo magnet, and usually always ended up with a tattoo after Guy's Night. He has had quite a few tattoos, some pretty epic, and some... not to much. Just like the fact that they made fun of Yuuto for the crabs thing, Yuuto and Gasper made fun of him for getting a kitten tattoo'd on his chest before he had gotten rid of it. Finally, Naruto and Yuuto made fun of Gasper for the fact that the boy almost always woke up with only his panties on... nothing else, just panties.\n\nYuuto was the drunken sex fiend.  \nNaruto was the drunken tattoo artist.  \nGasper was the drunken male stripper.\n\nReally, they shoudl most likely avoid getting drunk period... but alas, it wasn't a good Guy's Night unless they woke up in a strange place and had to be lectured by Rias about proper behavior. Sadly, they had no plans of stopping their late night drinking on Guy's Night... the ONLY night when they could do whatever the hell they wanted to. They weren't very good at holding their alchohol either, so they all got drunk pretty damn quickly... at least Naruto and Gasper had excuses though. They were both small bodies, so they got drunker quicker from smaller amounts of booze. Yuuto was just a light weight with his 'idiot juice' as Rias seemed to prefer to call it after a very humiliating experience they had.\n\nAh Guy's Night, you never cease to amaze.\n\n'What is that... pancakes?' Naruto thought as he put on a pair of shorts over his boxers when he remembered that Asia lived here now. With some shorts on, he wasn't concerned about his shirt, he made his way out of his room and into the living room to see Kuroka snoring on his couch like a drunking bum... a can of beer in her hands, but that was just an act so that she could have her fun. It was obvious that his older sister wasn't the one to make pancakes, and the last time Koneko made pancakes she accidently burned them so badly that she burned down their kitchen for the second time, with the first time it was burned down going to Naruto when he tried to make japanese candy.\n\n\"Good morning Naruto-kun!\"\n\nNaruto completely froze when he saw the sight of Asia Argento this morning of this day, because the second he layed eyes on her his mind completely froze and refused to even begin to reboot when his hazel eyes caught sight of the beauty in front of him. A huge blush started to slowly spread over his face, and suddenly he took back everything he ever thought about Issei being a pervert, because the sight in front of him at this very moment... pure amazing. It was like nothing in the world would ever beat the total sexy of what he was seeing right now.\n\nAsia Argento, a nun from the church of god, was currently standing in front of him slightly bent over so that her cleavage was visible to him. No, that wasn't the best part of this, but her breasts did make it even more better considering how much skin that you could see from them at this moment. Creamy white skin was on perfect display for Naruto when he saw Asia wearing something that would be sending Issei in a perfect pervert strom of nosebleeds and wet dreams. This was... amazing.\n\nNude... Apron.\n\nThat was right, right now Asia was wearing ONLY an apron to keep her body covered from the front, something that Naruto was sure had jump started his hormones for the morning. He was now perfectly awake when his eyes looked at the her outfit, and he was able to notice that the bottom only came up to the point that it barely hide her lower modesty, showing more than enough so that if Naruto wanted to, he would have wank material for years after this moment. Thankfully for him, the fact that he lived with women made sure that he wouldn't be masterbating to this amazing image.\n\nWear she had gotten this... Kuroka... Naruto had little doubt that this was in some part the fault his older sister. He wasn't getting mad over this though, because right now the purity that was Asia was wearing such a sexy outfit without being corrupted by it. Naruto's enhanced ability to see, and his sharper than average eyes were only a boon in this situation where Naruto was able to see the fact that Asia was wearing no bra under the apron either.\n\n'Damn this is so freaking sexy.' Naruto thought with a big smile growing on his face when Asia bent down a little further when he had become unresponsive to her words. Naruto could see her mouth moving, but right now the only thing that his mind was focused on was the fact that with her bending over he was able to see the pink of her nipples thanks to the fact that the apron was rather loosely tied to her. Sometimes having great eyesight... was freaking epic, and he was saving the image into his eyes for the rest of his life. He was able to notice the fact that not only was Asia not wearing a bra, but her panties were completely absent as well.\n\n\"Naruto-kun!? Are you okay, you have a funny grin on your face?\" Asia asked obliviously, and her responce was just the fact that for some reason Naruto was looking up and down on her body over and over again.\n\n\"Why don't you just set the table, Otouto will be just fine nya.\" Kuroka called out to Asia from the couch with a wave of her hand, and the innocent blonde haired girl nodded with a tilt of her head and turned around so that Naruto was given the perfect view of the fact that her butt was completely exposed. Her blonde hair was long enough so that it rested against her backside in a seductive way, and Asia didn't even seem to notice that she was doing something that was so obviously affecting Naruto in a good way... a very good way. Kuroka was grinning like the cat that caught the canary at how dumbstruck Naruto seemed the sweet little Asia was doing nude apron, one of the most sexy displays the world has ever known.\n\n'Nyahahaha! That was freaking priceless, and the girl was so gullible to fall for that.' Kuroka thought to herself wiht a wide grin on her face when she remembered how she had tricked Asia into thinking that nude apron was the best way for her to help Naruto get over the fact that he might be getting married soon.\n\nYou see, when Kuroka had met Asia she had already known that she would have fun with the girl the second that the two had made eye contact. The girl was so innocent and pure that Kuroka belived having a little fun at her expense would be even more rewarding then it was when she had fun at Naruto or Koneko's expense. Now though, this girl was so easy to trick that it almost felt wrong to trick her into doing this kind of stuff... of course, she hadn't been exactly tricking her when Kuroka had convinced Asia into wearing this. Asia had been desperate to learn the best way to cheer Naruto up from the mood she thought he would be in when he woke up, so Kuroka had told her the complete truth. Kuroka had explained in vague detail that Asia should wear nude apron, and when Asia had asked her how that would help Naruto feel better, Kuroka had been completely honest with the younger girl when she had informed her that nude apron was the best way to go if she wanted to help Naruto cheer up... and not to mention that if she could make Naruto jump Asia in a horny lust then she would be that much more pleased with herself for furthering the Nekoshou as a species.\n\nYou see, Nekoshou blood was very power. Like many Youkai species, the Nekoshou were made for the ability to breed with almost any humanoid species out there. This was because of the fact that a male Nekoshou being born was about a 1/100,000 chance of happening, which means that they needed to find a way to produce Pure-Blooded Nekoshou somehow. There were many Youkai species that were single gender only, so Youkai adapted in a way that would make sure their races didn't die out. Kuroka wanted Naruto to get with Asia, and stay with the human girl for this very reason. When Youkai, Nekoshou included, got a human pregnant or became pregnant with a human's child the child would in most cases become a Pure-Blood that certain species. The Nekoshou were of such a species, meaning that if she could get Naruto and Asia together then their children would become Pure-Blood Nekoshou as well. Even as he was right now, Naruto and Koneko were both considered Pure-Blood Nekoshou despite the devil taint in their bodies. Actually, unless the other parent had strong genes then any child from a Nekoshou would be a Pure-Blood Nekoshou or a Half-Blood Nekoshou. The Nekoshou gene was a very powerful dominant gene after all, and usually took a higher place than the non-Nekoshou parent's genes.\n\n\"Onee-chan... I love you so much right now.\" Naruto stated with the blush still on his face as he watched Asia bend down so that she could get the plates from the bottom drawer, being short people Koneko and naruto usually placed the important things closer to the bottom, and right now he was so glad that he was short.\n\n\"I know you do.. so go tap that ass nya.\" Kuroka teased her younger brother when she saw the slightly glazed look on his face as his eyes tracked every single movement Asia made. Every soft curve and jiggle of her body would be saved into his memory, as this sexy scene made it's way into his top ten list of things that he didn't want to ever forget. Oh yeah, he was sure that somewhere Issei was crying as his perv senses told him that Naruto was enjoying this feast of the eyes without him their to oggle the fantastic way Asia's slighter larger than average chest bounced with each step.\n\n\"Most Onee-chans don't tell their Otoutos to tap that ass as you put it.\" Naruto pointed out dryly, without taking his eyes off Asia as the girl started to hum a little song as she started to make more pancakes. What he said was true though, of course, most men didn't have sisters like Kuroka that felt that their was nothing wrong with a boy naruto's age having unportected sex with the purpose of getting the girl pregnant. Kuroka was a very strange person, and while it was nice that she wanted Naruto to help her restore their race by having sex with other girls, it was weird that Kuroka was activally trying to get him to start noticing women. Even at a younger age she would always point out a girls three sizes to him, and do these small things to try and get him to take an interest in the female body sooner than he biologically should. Seriously, what kind of sister tries to get his brother to knock up girls at age 15?\n\nHis sister apparently.\n\n\"Most Otoutos don't get chubbies in front of their beautiful, smart, loving, and amazing Onee-chans.\" Kuroka stated with a smirk on her face when she noticed the light straining in the front of Naruto's shorts before even he noticed it. Naruto blinked for a moment, before he blushed when he looked down and saw that at some point when he was watching the mostly nude Asia set the table he had followed his male instincts and gained what Kuroka so nicely called a chubby. Naruto's hands went to his crotch, while Kuroka snorted at how he was suddenly embarrassed.\n\n\"Pffft, like I haven't seen your junk hundreds of times before nya. Don't worry Otouto, you have everything to be embarrassed about if LITTLE MISS NUN, LOOK OVER HERE NYA!\" Kuroka shouted with a smirk on her face, when Naruto's eyes widened at the same time as Asia jumped from the surprise of finally noticing them talking. Naruto glared at his older sister for teasing him like this, before he remembered something. Grinning back at Kuroka before Asia could turn around, Naruto jumped back and landed in his favorite chair with his legs crossed in a way that hid himself from Asia's view while he silently glared at his older sister. Kuroka stuck her tongue out at him, before she shook her beer can and frowned when she noticed that she was out of beer.\n\n\"Yes, Kuroka-san?\" Asia asked when she finally got to turning around, and Kuroka held her can of beer up into the air.\n\n\"Be a dear, and get me a beer... ha, that rhymed nya.\" Kuroka laughed at her own rhyming, while Asia nodded and went back the fridge and opened it so that she could get one of the beers that Kuroka had bought last night while Naruto was asleep. Unlike her little brother, Kuroka was very skilled at handling her alchohol to a certain degree, something that Naruto was jealous of lately with the fact that Guy's Night always ends up with him and the others shit faced drunk by the end of the night.\n\n\"Okay Kuroka-san, but these aren't good for you.\" Asia stated as she brought the beer over to Kuroka and gave it to the older woman with a slightly worried look on her face, while Kuroka had a distasteful look on hers.\n\n\"Don't use honorifics with me... screw it, call me Onee-chan... you are practically part of the family already nya.\" Kuroka commented with a sly teasing to both Naruto and surprisingly Asia when she got the underlining message in her words. Kuroka had basically just told Asia that she approved of her if she wanted to pursue Naruto's romantic interest, something that wasn't really hard to get from Kuroka. It was actually pretty easy to get her blessing when a girl wanted to have sex, but getting into a serious relationship was another thing... it was hard to tell which was being refered to right now.\n\n'Is this some kind of karmic punishment!?' Naruto thought in great annoyance when he realised that even in times of crisis Kuroka was going to tease him until he wanted to strangle her with a pillow in her sleep. As much as he loved her, she could be one of the most annoying people in the world when she really got into teasing you. Asia on the other hand, had no idea what she should be thinking right about now. Naruto was such a nice guy, and she did have feelings for him, but she also knew that there was a strong chance that he would be getting married. Asia blinked when a strange thought came to her head, and she realized that this entire living room seemed to be a little dusty. She would see if she could clean it up a bit when she was alone, so that she could pleasantly surprise Naruto.\n\n\"You two are so cute with your blushes nya.\" Kuroka stated with a sly smile on her face when she stood up and went to the kitchen to get some pancakes. Naruto blinked, before he realized that he was in the same room as pancakes, and hadn't started eating them yet. How the hell hadn't he noticed the pancakes before now? Naruto's mind was completely blanked out when Asia hurried in front of him, and her hair moved to the side to show her the creamy skin on her butt once more, and showing that she had no tan lines either. Naruto suddenly remembered why he hadn't noticed the pancakes, because who could think about pancakes with such a beauty in front of them wearing nothing but an apron... and didn't seem to think anything was wrong with what she wasd doing?\n\n'Dat ass... screw you Issei, while all of you go train with Rias, I get to spend time with a hot girl.' Naruto thought with a light smirk on his face. He wasn't going to skip out on the Rating Game, but he was sure that Rias was MORE than capable enough to train her own peerage without him. He would appeared sometimes before the Rating Game to disvuss strategy with Rias, but he was damn well going to enjoy this break from all his responsibilities while he had the chance.\n\nHot girl... or getting teased by Akeno for ten days and forced into training Rias' peerage with no time for his own training. Hot girl... getting teased... girl... teased?\n\nHonestly, the choice wasn't that hard.\n\n\"You better save me some pancakes Onee-chan nya!\" Naruto shouted as he ran towards the kitchen with only one thought left in his head before he entered the room with Asia and Kuroka.\n\nHotties for the win!\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t32. Chapter 32 Ramen\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter  \nOver 100,000 Words!**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Ahhhhh, this is relaxing.\" Naruto stated in absolute joy when he found himself just wasting the day away with two people he considered dear to him in one of the ways a cat like him would love to spend the day if given the choice... something he barely had time to do anymore with how busy Rias always kept him these days. The old past time for a cat that far surpassed the epic length in history of the past time of baseball for Americans. The warmth of his past time just also happened to be something that other devils hated, and even though he was tainted by devilhood his inner cat made him love what he was going.\n\nHe was sun bathing.\n\nMore accurately, he was sun bathing with Kuroka and Asia while he still had the chance to before the Rating Game between Riser and Rias started, so Kuroka had suggested that Naruto and Asia get some bonding time together by Naruto showing Asia some of the more fun things to do around the city. Of course, Kuroka then decided that she wanted to tag along as well the second Naruto had said that he was going to show Asia a day in the life of a cat. Meaning that today would be a day of doing whatever the hell they wanted, and maybe just being lazy and relaxed the entire day if they could get away with it... and so far they were getting away with it. The day in the life of a cat was a pretty easy one, and something that Kuroka was somewhat glad she and her family got to live now that they were off the streets. They could never relax liek this if they had still been on the streets, and the sun in the Underworld was just an illusion made for Reincarnated Devils to get used to the Underworld. The Underworld's sun made no real heat, and wasn't very pleasant to bask in for the Nekoshou, it gave off a creepy feeling to thoise sensative to nature, which was why being in the human world was so much fun for them.\n\n\"The life of a cat starts with sleeping in bed, or in a darker place... then we move on to eating breakfast and maybe hunting an animal smaller than us for fun nya... after that we bask in the sun for fun and just sleep until our next meal... or until we decide to groom ourselfs, another fun thing to do nya. Then we enjoy lavishing in the attention of others, until we don't want attention and go back to sleep or eat again nya.\" Kuroka explained to Asia with a relaxed, maybe even extremely relaxed smile on her face as she ran a hand through Asia's hair to show the girl just how to properly lavish in the attention of somebody else, and with their current position that was an easy thing to do. They were all positioned in a way where they could bond the best, or at least in a way where everyone was the most comfy. They were even in one of Naruto's favorite spots in the city to sunbath... on top of the old school building where the roof was warm during the day. This place was farther away from the city, so new super pesky emotions for Naruto to deal with right now since he was currently in contact with Asia, so he was only sensing her emotion... wearing the collar all the time made his neck get a rash.\n\nThat was NOT fun.\n\n\"That seems nice... is this position needed though?\" Asia asked with a tint of red to her face, but that could just be the heat they were bathing in, or the fact that they had been in the sun for awhile and she was starting to get a little burnt. Her question did have merit to it though when one looked at their rather awkward positions, and Kuroka snorted in unison with Naruto at how Asia was questioning the comfort of their current position.\n\nAt this moment, the three of them were surrently positioned so that everyone had their head placed on something very soft. Kuroka was leaning against a large pillow so that she had a nice place for her head, something that she never left home withoyut these days, and kept stored in her pocket dimension. Kuroka smiled though at the question and looked down to see why Asia had asked it, and with good reason... Asia currently had her head resting on top of Kuroka's stomach, a place that was almost as soft as the pillow that Kuroka herself was resting against, but her muscle tone had made her stomach a bit more firm than the pillow... something that wasn't truly a bad thing.\n\nNaruto's head on the other hand was resting on top of Asia's stomach, and that was the true cause for Asia's slight discomfort and happiness. Her hand was resting in his white hair and rubbing it much like a cat owner would scratch their cat behind the ears... best part, Asia had no idea that Naruto was so close to purring under her hands. She wasn't paying attention to what her hand was doing, which made the movement soft and fluent enough so that she didn't irritate his hidden ears like some others would. Not everyone scratching the hidden ears would be a good thing if they did it wrong, which many people did... they either scratched way to hard, or they would dig into the wrong spot and cause a pretty bad enough of pain to the area.\n\n\"Completely, bonding and all that nya.\" Kuroka stated with a smirk on her face at how easy it was to trick Asia into doing whatever she wanted to girl to do. Asia nodded lightly in response to the answer, something that made Kuroka smirk even more than before as she started to rub Asia's hair lightly.\n\n\"While wearing swimsuits apparently nya.\" Naruto stated with a twitching eyebrow, but he had to admit that he was thankful that Kuroka had convinced Asia to join them in wearing a swimsuit when sunbathing. Of course, since they didn't have any swimsuits that fit Asia... well she could get away with wearing Naruto's and a shirt, they had decided that they would raid Rias' home for one of her old swimsuits that she had grown out of. Naruto was sure that Rias wouldn't mind them letting Asia use one of her older ones now that her hips and bust had grown too large for her to even wear them.\n\n\"Yes, swimsuits are a must nya.\" Kuroka stated right back at him with a not so hidden grin on her face at how she had decided that for sun bathing swimsuits were completely needed to enjoy this activity to the fullest. She herself was wearing her version of what had as a swimsuit, and if Naruto hadn't bathed with her for as long as he had he would have demanded that she cahnge her swimsuit into something at least a fraction more decent than the swimsuit she was currently wearing... something that Naruto was sure that even Akeno would hesitate in wearing to the beach... which was saying something since Akeno wore swimsuits that barely overed anything, but still covered more than what his older sister was currently wearing, and this was perhaps the biggest reason that Asia was uncomfy with her head being on Kuroka's stomach.\n\n\"That... and Kuroka is so lazy that she doesn't do laundry for herself nya. She always tricks others into doing it for her, so this is all she has right now nya?\" Naruto asked in his own teasing way to his older sister, and she gave him a light pointed look at revealing the fact that she didn't know much... or anything about household chores, nor did she ever bother to attempt and learn how to do such boring things like cooking and cleaning. If she was able to trick somebody like Grayfia into doing her laundry for her, then she was more than fine when it came to this kind of thing... but he was right, this was all she wore.\n\nRight now, Kuroka was wearing a swimsuit that could only be described as barely above nudity. The top was simply string that was tied around her breasts and shoulders like a bikini, and instead of the normal breast sized cloth to ciover her boobs, she had used her abilities to shrink this part down to such small levels that the clothing that once covered her whole breasts, now only covered her nipples... literally, the string top only covered her nipples and nothing more. A single slip and her breasts would be free for everyone to see, something that Naruto knew didn't bother his sister in the slightest. She had gone with a pure black one like her name would suggest, but that wasn't the most worrying part of this... the most disturbing part of this entire thing was the bottoms of her swimsuit... if you could even think to call it that. The bottoms of her swimsuit were an act of public indecency waiting to happen, because this bottom was simply a G-string and a little bit of cloth in the front to cover her vagina.\n\nIt was pretty much a thong that covered her clit and a little bit more, that was how tiny this thing was.\n\n'How the hell did she even get that... don't want to know.' Naruto thought with a twitching eyebrow when he looked towards Kuroka's bottom for a split second and sighed. It was harder to look away when the black contrasted against her creamy pale skin, but it was rather easy for him to ignore all of the seductive charmt hat she was radiating from her very soul, something that lesser men would fall to their knees and bask in so that they could hope to catch of glimpse of her sex appeal.\n\nHe was actually glad that Asia seemed to have found an old fashion swimsuit in Rias' closet, which Naruto borrowed for her. He knew that Roias didn't... couldn't wear this one anymore without the chest being way to tight on her. This was just a simple pink bikini, nothing special about it besides the white frills on the underside of the breasts and on top of the bikini bottom. It was perfectly decent, and kept everything covered up safely so that Asia wouldn't have to worry about anything falling out. The only thing that seemed to be a little bit out of place were the two red hearts on the cup of each breast, right in the place her nipples would be... but that was okay simply because that didn't seem to be showing too much either. Naruto sweat dropped when he remembered how Rias had gotten this bikini a few years back, it had been a Valentines gift to her... from him actually when they went to a trip to the human world for a day with her peerage.\n\nIt looked very good on Asia, but he would have to take the girl shopping for her own bathing suit. He meant it when he said that this was only a borrowed swimsuit, so once they were done with it Naruto would have it returned to Rias' closet. This was her swimsuit, even if it didn't fit her anymore.\n\n\"You look very nice in your swimsuit Naruto-kun.\" Asia commented as she took this as a chance to look at him while he wore his swimsuit... which was funny that he even owned one in the first place when Naruto had zero ability in swimming. In honesty, Naruto had never tried to learn thanks to a very small fear of water that went above his head. He had never been very good at swimming in shallow water either... mostly because nobody had ever been there to properly teach him.\n\nKuroka couldn't swim very well, but she was able to swim if she truly needed to.  \nKoneko, same boat as him, she just plain sucked at swimming.  \nAkeno... just no, he would not trust her not to take advantage of his fear, not when she was the cause of his Pedobear fear.  \nGasper was a Dhampire and prefered not to go in the water, even though he knew how to swim.  \nRias could swim pretty damn well, but when she attempted to teach him they had been interupted by Akeno and her teasing.  \nSirzechs... no, just no.\n\nAnyway, this swimsuit had been bought for the sole purpose of when they went to the beach, and he wanted to play in the sand and build sandcastles or dig holes... he was really good at digging holes in the sand.\n\n\"Thanks... I am surprised it still fits nya.\" Naruto stated as he touched the cloth of the bright orange swimsuit with black lines going down the side of each leg. The shorts were rather short on him, only going down to the middle of his thighs They did fit just fine around the waist, which was all that mattered to him at this point. The more skin he was showing the better when sun bathing like this.\n\n\"How... how do I look?\" Asia asked with a small smile on her face as she avoided his gaze when he looked up at her, but all that did was make Naruto smile lightly and get more comfy into her stomach.\n\n\"You look great Asia... don't even ask Onee-chan, because I am not going there.\" Naruto stated in a deadpan when he felt Kuroka get ready to ask Naruto the same question. He was not about to comment on his sisters barely bikini, something that had now slipped and was showing her entire left breast. Asia didn't even noticed this fact, simply because she was only looking down at Naruto by this point with a shy smile on her face.\n\n\"I'm hungry nya...\" Kuroka muttered out loud when her stomach growled with an angry roar at not being fed soon enough, while naruto chuckled at her in a condensending way, knowing that she had skipped breakfast today in favor of rudely awakening them all for the reason of trying to get them closer together with swimsuits.\n\n\"Nyahahaha, you should have... nevermind nya.\" Naruto said with a large blush on his face when his stomach growled at him moments later. He shouldn't have laughed at Kuroka, because if he hadn't he believed that his stomach wouldn't have growled like that. It seemed like karma just loved to make him pay for any slight against it... oh well, it was still pretty funny.\n\nNaruto and Kuroka blinked in unison when the loudest and most... hunger filled growl yet was heard from right next to Naruto's ear. Naruto sat up in surprise as he looked down at Asia's soft stomach, while Kuroka raised an eyebrow with a teasing smirk across her lips. This was just perfect, because a healthy appetite was something that she believed would be a great match for an eating machine like Naruto could be when he wanted to be. She didn't want one of those little twings near her brother, but she didn't want a fatty either... she wanted a nice and healthy girl. She had nothing personal against either twiggy or fat girls, but she wanted a nice and attractive girl to be with her younger brother... that didn't look like she starved herself. Petite and anorexic were two different things, because anorexic girls most likely wouldn't be able to give birth properly opr safely. A healthy girl with a good appetite, but was also pretty and toned would be able to bear beautiful children.\n\nDamnit, she wanted some nieces... and maybe nephews if she was lucky, to spoil and tease. She wanted her race to bloom again darn it!\n\n\"Excuse me... I am a little hungry as well.\" Asia said with a small stutter as she looked up at the sky, anywhere but the people that were giving her the amused looks.\n\n\"No worries... I know just the place nya!\" Kuroka stated with smile, the least she could do was pay for their meal. She also knew the perfect place to go, because she had recently gained an appreciation for japanese food again after her brief addiction to American junk food and German cheeses. Well, the Nekoshou were a Youkai species that were originally birthed in Japan, so it was natural for them to have a taste for their native countries foods.\n\n_**Location Change - Forty Minutes Later**_\n\n_Kokaku's Dinner_\n\n\"This is just the place to sate our hunger nya!\" Kuroka stated as the small group of three looked in front of them to see what appeared to be a simple bar-like shack at the edge of the park. Naruto tilted his head in confusion, not really sure why he was excited about this... his favorite food was fish, so why was he drolling over the fact that there was this... delicious smell coming from inside of the bar that Kuroka had taken them to. Naruto took a step forward towards the smell of the great scented food inside.\n\n\"What does this place serve?\" Asia questioned, nobody noticing that Naruto was starting to sway on his feet as a familiar smell hit his nose. He didn't know why it was so familiar, because before he had gotten his collar he barely left either his apartment or the school and clubroom. Not to mention that the Gremory family were an eastern style devil family, meaning that Japanese food was something that they almost never got... even to this day, most of the time they ate eastern food.\n\n\"Well, they make a lot of good stuff... but the best thing would have to be the... ramen nya. They even put these little pork slices inside it, and their miso ramen is to die for nya!\" Kuroka said, before Naruto twitched in pain when a splitting headache suddenly came to him out of nowhere. Naruto grabbed the sides of his head in sheer agony, and it was sheer force of will alone that stopped him from screaming in pure pain. Naruto couldn't even hear Kuroka grab his shoulder and pull him to her face to see what was wrong, or Asia yelling his name when he started to sweat and go pale.\n\n'Ichi... raku... ramen! I wanna... be the greatest... Ho... ka... ge.' Naruto thought when the image of a young boy with blond hair and bright blue eyes made his way into Naruto's mind. The boy was wearing a rbight orange jumpsuit, and on his sleeve was a simple of some kind of whirlpool. The boy had spiky hair, and on his forehead was some kind of headband with a metal plate and a spiral leaf etched into it. The face was kind of fuzzy, with the eyes being the only thing clear about the blurry image.\n\nThen, just as quickly as the image came to him it was gone. Naruto started to breath a bit heavier, before he noticed that somebody was shaking his shoulders. Blinking lightly, he looked up to see his older sister looking at him with worry.\n\n\"Naruto... Otouto, are you okay? You were in some pretty bad pain right there nya? You were lucky that Asia-chan was here, with her Sacred Gear she was able to stop whatever was hurting you nya.\" Kuroka pointed out the fact that Asia was holding her hands on his head with glowing green rings on her fingers. Naruto blinked a few times when he saw how focused that Asia was on helping him get better from... whatever that had been. That would explain why the image had vanished before he could get a good look at the boy's face, because Asia had been healing whatever had been hurting him before it could do anything else. Of course, that image reminded him a lot of his vivid dreams where he would get insperation for his Youjutsu and Taijutsu moves... only he wasn't asleep this time.\n\n\"Can I go home nya?\" Naruto asked with a wobble in his step, because right now he felt extremely strange, and the rising feeling in his gut wasn't the good kind. Right now Naruto felt like he was going to be physically sick from whatever had just happened, and he had no idea why he was reacting this way. Kuroka looked at Asia for the briefest of moments to see if she thought that it would be okay for Naruto to move back home, or if he should just rest on the bench before going back home.\n\n\"Sure, but I can't tell whats wrong with you.\" Asia told him in worry, but Naruto had to take a deep breath to help settle his stomach before he nodded to her.\n\nHe didn't feel so good right now.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Poll End: Winner Shion **_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t33. Chapter 33 The Mind in Confusion\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Where... where am I?\" Naruto asked when he looked around the strange new area he had never been to before, the last thing he could remember was laying down on the couch in his apartment after Kuroka had agreed to skip the meal for his health. One second he had been trying to get the horrible feeling out of his stomach, and the next moment he was in an area that could only be described as the strangest maze in the world. There was very little to go in the way of lighting, but what did light up the area were old fashioned flaming torches attached to the walls... that didn't seem to ever want to burn out.\n\nThe room he was in at the moment was a maze all on it's own, and it seemed to be comprised of multiple floors with stairs leading up and down in impossible directions. Some sets of stairs were even twisting and turning so that they led to doors in the wall on the ceiling... there weren't even real walls like in a normal room. The walls were lined with bricks, and some led to hallways that went who knows where, and there was no real way to tell a sense of direction in here. There was no way for him to know which was was north, which was south, or even if Naruto was currently on the floor of the ceiling... it was like he had no sense of direction in the first place. He had to frown deeply when he went up to the only door in this section of the room, before he noticed that this door was made of steel and bolted shut with dozens and dozens of golden chains connected to it and the wall around the door so that it would stay closed.\n\n_Six Paths Sage Mode_\n\n\"The fuck?\" Naruto questioned as he placed his hand against the door, before he jumped back when the chains turned pitch black and spikes came from them in an attempt to keep Naruto away from the door. Naruto jumped back just in time to avoid being impaled by the black chain spikes, before he had to retreat even further when they chased him for a few more feet. Naruto stopped moving when he was against the other side of the room, and the black spikes went back to the chains on the door... the chains that soon turned golden again and stayed still once more. Naruto took a breath and walked forward, happy that the chains didn't seem to be reacting to him again. That did leave him to wonder about what could possible be behind the door, but he just sighed and decided to check out the next room that was rather close by. He did this by walking up the closet set of stairs that led to a smaller indent in the wall on the right, and the door this time was actually very different than the last one.\n\nInstead of a steel door with chains blocking it, this one seemed to be made of some kind of sand-like material. Naruto's eyes narrowed a little when he saw indents in the door, before he blew on part of the door and sand started to fall off to reveal that this door had words written on it as well.\n\n_Shukaku's Desert_\n\nNaruto grabbed the handle of the door, before he twisted it and was surprised to find out that the door was locked. He closed his eyes and mentally counted to ten to cool his head, but he should have known that the first door he tried besides the murder door would be locked. Naruto jumped back and and looked to see another set of stairs going up to another door nearby. Deciding that giving it a try wouldn't hurt anything, Naruto started to walk these stairs as well with his way being lit by the torches in the room. He was surprised when he noticed that this door seemed to be made of something very similar to a turtles shell in color, shape, and texture as well when Naruto placed his hand on the door.\n\n_Isobu's Lake_\n\n\"And it seems to be locked as well... just great.\" Naruto stated with a twitching as he kicked the door lightly, only to stop and grab his foot in pain when he learned this this door was freaking hard as steel... no, even harder than the strongest steel he had ever broken before. He frowned, before he started to make his way towards the stairs that led to the door connected to the ceiling. When he managed to reach the ceiling, he noticed that gravity wasn't affecting him normally because he was walking on the ceiling while feeling like he was still on the floor. He sighed to himself before looking at the door this time on the ceiling, and reading the name before trying to open it, he found that this one had a similar theme to the others.\n\n_Chomei's Sky_\n\n\"Locked... damnit.\" Naruto thought as he jumped from the ceiling and landed down on the floor moments later and he ran full sprint up the next set of stairs that led to the next room. This room was small, but the walls seemed to be made of some sort of bamboo. He sighed and looked at the door at the end of this darker hallways connected to the main room, before he saw the same of this room etched into the door's bamboo.\n\n_Son Goku's Forest_\n\n\"Gaah! Why looked!\" Naruto shouted in annoyance as he sprinted back to the main room again and looked around to see if he could find something, anything, that would get him out of here. He didn't even know where he was at the moment, so he jumped onto a platform sticking out of the wall that led to another door. He sighed in relief when he noticed that this door didn't look to be locked... then he winced lightly when he noticed all the green ooze coming out of the door itself, and he tried to get a grib on the doors handle before he frowned when he noticed that the door wasn't going to let him open it when the slime hardened to the point that the door became unable to change from closed to open.\n\n_Saiken's Bath_\n\n\"Bath... really?\" Naruto questioned with a raised eyebrow, before he sighed and hung his head in slight defeat before he let himself fall from the platform back to the floor and landed on his feet. He walked towards the next door that required him to walk up two flights of stairs, before he blinked when he noticed that there were two doors here. He tilted his head in curiousity, before he came closer to the doors and noticed that they looked like prison cells with thousands of tiny chains and black flames keeping these doors closed. The name for these two side by side doors confused him, because they weren't on the cell doors, but instead they were on the floor in front of the doors.\n\n_Madara's Prison_  \n_Kaguya's Prison_\n\n\"Nope... nope nope. Not even going to try this one.\" Naruto stated when he jumped in shock when purple eyes were seen behind the one that went by Madara, and pale white ones with red linings were seen behind the one marked Kaguya. If these were prison cells, with black flames and thousands of tiny but strong chains like the one from before guarding it then he didn't even want to think about going inside those doors, even if they were unlocked. He was not going to bet that stupid, if they were locked away then they were locked away for a pretty good reason... well, he was sure that they were locked away for a reason. He had no idea why he got the feeling that he should never even think about opening these doors. That was why he told himself that he would avoid this place as he went over to the next set of stairs that led in a different direction down.\n\nThe auras behind those doors creeped the hell out of him.\n\nThat was why he sighed in relief when the next door he visited seemed to be a bit more cheerful, and he looked at the door itself and smiled to himself when he noticed that the door was made from some kind of swirling ink material... that moved the handle of the door out of his reach whenever he made a grab for it.\n\n_Gyuki's Mountain_\n\n\"Getting real tired of your shit mystery room.\" Naruto said with a twitching eye as he stormed away from this door and made his way to another place, one that would hopefully he a bit more helpful than the others so far. He frowned this time when he came across the next door, because right now he was pretty sure it was going to avoid trying to be opened. This door was something that made him a bit happy, because his claws naturally came out when he tested to door out and found that this bright pink door was made up of the same stuff from scratching posts.\n\n_Matatabi's Playroom_\n\n\"Getting very angry now.\" Naruto almost growled out when he found that this door was locked shut as well, but now that he was paying a bit more attention he was sure that he could hear... purring coming from the other side of this door. He sighed in frustration, before walking off to the next set of stairs once more and coming upon a room that he wanted to try next, one of the few remaining doors actually. He ran towards the door at full speed, before he crashed his shoulder into the door... but not a single dent was made in this door either, and he had been slightly annoyed when this one seemed to be made up of wood in a similar fashion to a horse stable... yet it was pretty freaking strong.\n\n_Kokuo's Ranch_\n\n\"You are just gloating now... aren't you mystery room with no exit?\" Naruto questioned seemingly nothing, even though he was sure that this room was making sure all these doors wren't going to open just to mess with him. He tried to calm himself down, before he walked at a forced sedate pace from this room to the next... two rooms? This time the double doors seemed to have a red metalic look to them, and in front of the doors was a shrine 'doorway' with no door in it. He walked through the shrine gate, before he looked at each room and saw something that confused him greatly.\n\n_Yin Kurama's Sewer_  \n_Yang Kurama's Sewer_\n\n\"Two Kurama doors... it budged!?\" Naruto shouted in shock when the Yin door budged very slightly when Naruto pushed against it. He was completely unprepared for the amazing amount of pure energy that came crashing out of the door in an explosion of orangish red. Naruto was blown back by the force of the energy spewing from the slightly open door... energy that far surpassed anything that he had ever truly fought against before. Naruto was blown through the gate again, before he noticed that the gate was holding back most of the escaping energy wityh only a fraction of the energy escaping at this point... then the energy just stopped flowing out of the door period and Naruto looked at it with some annoyance. Of course the only time a door opened, he would be assualted by some strange kind of... chakra? Now that he tried to think about it, that was a very potent chakra that had come flying out of the door.\n\nNaruto sighed before he turned around and tried to see if he could find another door, any door would do at this point. He just wanted a door that wasn't a trap, because he was starting to hate whatever this place was. Naruto walked down another set of stairs, before he blinked when he noticed that these stairs were going down... way down. So far down that he had unknowing walked about ten minutes straight and still found nothing but stairs. He twitched when he finally found a door, and he looked at it with sigh. This door was completley made of some kind of strange purple wood... with a red eyebrall design with rings and tomma in them. Naruto looked at the door and around it, before he found the name of this door.\n\n_Shinju's Moon_\n\n\"I don't even want to know anymore, I really don't.\" Naruto stated as he began to walk up the stairs again at a faster pace than he walked down. He was really annoyed by this point, because when he got back tpo the room he noticed that there were only three more doors left in this room. He sighed and walked over to the platform that had the next unopened door, this door was simple... just a normal wood door on it with a red swirl on the front of it... never mind, this door had zero handle on it so it was obviously a trap door... with a small crack on the side heading towards the red swirl.\n\n_Uzumaki Memories_\n\n\"Strange... next door?\" Naruto stated when he noticed that the platform he was on floated away from this spot onto the next door with him on it. Naruto looked at the next door with an expression of annoyance at another door with a strange symbol on it... this one was simply of an orange sun. Naruto noticed that this door didn't have any name on it, or even around it showing that this was perhaps the most suspicious door in the bunch. He made to open this door, before the door changed to stone the second he touched it... he took his hand off and the door changed back. He used his left hand again and touched the door, before it changed to stone for as long as he had his hand on it. That was way he then moved away from the door and hopped off the platform completely and started to walk towards the middle of the room in a matter of moments.\n\nThe final door was actually part of the floor, and Naruto noticed that this door seemed to be shaped just like a snake biting it's own tail. Under this door was a black infinity symbol, so trying his luck with his eyes rolling he pressed his hands against the door and it swung open completely to reveal a mass of ever swirling colors inside this door. His eyes opened at how this door not only opened, but seemed to lead to somewhere with a lot of colors in it. Naruto was about to jump into the door and see if this was an exit, before he heard a young girl's voice ring through out the room. He frowned when he couldn't make out any of the girls words, or even where she was.\n\nHe was about to ask her to speak again, before he jolted up with a start.\n\n\"Naruto-kun, are you okay?\" Asia asked Naruto with concern in her voice, before Naruto blinked and looked around to see that he was sitting up on the couch he had last remembered himself being. Blinking with a frown on his face he didn't answer Asia as he placed his hand against his forehead with only a single thought going through his mind.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Yes, that was his Mindscape.**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Gama Musuko (New Story, not out yet)**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t34. Chapter 34 Licking\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**The Rating Game will be in 2 Chapters.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto frowned lightly when he looked down at a piece of paper that was left for him by Kuroka when she left the other night. He had been hoping to get more time with his older sister before the Rating Game in two days, but it would seem that he wasn't going to get that chance. He was currently waiting on Asia to finish with the breakfast that she had insisted on making this morning, and he was tempted to try and get her to do the nude apron again... if Issei could hear Naruto's thoughts then he would be cheering for another person being coverted to the side of the pervert. Of course, Naruto almost felt like crying tears of shame at how he was slowly being turned into a pervert... it was a humbling experience to see things from the perverted point of view.\n\nPushing his issues with perversion from his mind, Naruto picked up the letter that Kuroka had wrote him before leaving and started to look over it again for the forth time this morning alone.\n\n_ Dear Otouto,_  \n_Sorry for leaving early, but my mission is calling me back before I start to look suspicious for being gone from the group I am spying on for too long. If I am gone too long then it will appear strange, but I will come visit again as soon as possible. Of course, I won't just leave without leaving a few little surprises for you. I left a few of my older kinky outfits that I resized to fit somebody with a body like a certain blonde just in case you want to get into any kinky fun._\n\n_Remember, don't wear a condom if you are going to have sex... it will feel better for both of you, and you might get lucky and knock her up. In fact, as your older sister I want you to have your first sexual experience with a girl like Asia-chan... do it, your Onee-chan commands it of you... kidding, but also not kidding._\n\n_On a more serious note, Sirzechs has sent me a message about the Rating Game that will be coming up when Rias gets back to Kuoh. You will need to tell Rias as soon as possible that she shouldn't make any battle plans involving her entire peerage as the base. Riser has decided that he was going to make things more 'fair' for Rias by playing the variation of the Rating Games known as the Dice Figure Game. Make no mistake, even though this makes it seem to be good for Rias, it isn't. I have been using some of my free time to spy on the Phenex family as of late, and I have learned that Riser has been increasing his peerages base abilities and fighting skills. Their increase and experience in the Rating Games will be more apparent... do not let your own power go to your head or you will have a hard time._\n\n_On a secondary note, it would seem that Ravel will be gunning for you if she is chosen for the Dive Figure Game even though it was originally her idea for the two of you to get married. Be wary of her, despite her young age she is still a High-Class Devil from the Phenex family with all the same powers as her siblings. Don't forget that her observation skill and ability to think about battle plans is one of the number one reasons that Riser has won most of the games he has played in thus far, but unlike her older brothers she has an advantage you MUST, and I repeat MUST remember... she is a Bishop. You may be powerful, but don't underesitimate a High-Class Devil from a powerful family that has their powers boosted by an Evil Piece._\n\n_Finally, and maybe the most important thing... no matter what you chose during the Rating Game... I will support you. If you surrender and let Rias get married to Riser, or if you try your hardest and have to get married to Ravel... as your sister I will stand by your side and be there for you if you need me._\n\n_Love, your super-epic-amazing-awesome-neko-neko-loving sister Kuroka._\n\n'That is right... now that I think about it there is no information about how Ravel-chan fights. She has never once done battle in any one of Riser's Rating Games, and her ability to process information has been a leading cause for Riser's many victories... this is worrying though.' Naruto thought as he looked at the letter again to make sure that he wasn't misunderstanding anything about what it was talking about. He looked at the Dice Figure Game part again with a sigh, knowing that Rias was not going to like that at all. Her peerage had no experience in a Rating Game period, so a special Rating Game would be a bit more than many of them could plan for with no heads up.\n\nThe Rating Games were usually a long battle between the Kings by using their minds and placing their peerage in stategic places and matching them up against opponents they could beat so that they could decrease the enemies numbers, and the Rating Game ended when one of the Kings were either defeated or surrendered from the match. Rias and he had both been making plenty of plans against Riser, knowing how he fought in normal Rating Games from the footage that they had attained from each game.\n\nRiser had a primary style of sending out his weaker pieces in groups of three, with one stronger pieces leading them into enemy territory so that the Pawns could promote to Queen level. Then he would have his promotes pawns and other pieces thin out the enemies, or altogether defeat them. Riser usually had his pawns promote as quickly as possible so that he could overpower the enemy with brute force and then make sure that nothing was left for him to do... and in the chance that his pawns and other pieces were defeated he would either take care of what was left himself, or he would have his Queen do it while he attacked the King of the enemy peerage. This was his primaru way of fighting that had won him at least five of the eight games he had won, with the other three being that he surrounded the King with his entire peerage and just had them blitz the opponent right off the bat.\n\nRiser had only lost two Rating Games, and both times he lost were because he respected the opponents and lost on purpose. This wouldn't be the case for Rias, so he was going to do anything that he could to throw her off her game.\n\nRiser was an arrogant, prideful, smug, and unpleasant person, but those weren't his only triats that counted at the moment. He was smart enough to win Rating Games, his arrogance was somewhat justified because of the power he was born with. He had a good reason to be proud of his skills which he had honed through experience, and his family teachings had been an asset on his ability to fight. He was skilled in Fire and Wind magic, and his hand to hand skills were something that had to be given a certain amount of respect, even if he as far from the greatest in that aspect.\n\nAs of right now, the only people that had what it took to take Riser out were Akeno if she actually used her hidden abilities, Yuuto if he started to use his other Sacred Gear, Gasper if he was able to drink powerful blood beforehand, Kalawarner if she could nail Riser with enough of the Light Spears, Naruto himself with his Youjutsu or Senjutsu, and finally Blaze with his Holy Swords and the Light Guns he had... collected from the battlegrounds against the priests. While that all sounded like it would be enough, it wasn't in this case.\n\nThe Dice Figure Games were a version of the Rating Games that had the Kings place certain pieces of their against the opponents in one big battle for victory, and once the entire other team was taken out the winner would be decided. This would mean that Rias wouldn't be able to use her entire peerage, or even half of her peerage if things went bad for her in the rolling of the dice. You see, the way to decide how many pieces that were allowed to fight was decided by one thing.\n\nA roll of the dice.\n\nThe Kings of the peerages would roll a six sided dice, and then the two Kings would add up the number they got from their rolls.\n\nExample: If Rias rolled a five, and then Riser rolled a two the grand total would be seven. That would mean that the total value of the pieces could be seven at most. If that was the case, then Naruto himself would be completely unable to join the fight since his value as a Queen was at the number nine. That went beyond the value limit.\n\nThere was a reason why pieces were given values. The Queen was worth 9 Pawns, the Bishops and Knights would be worth 3 Pawns. The Rooks would be worth 5 Pawns. Finally, the King varied based on many variables, but they could have a value between 1 and 12... most ranged between 10 and 12 though. Pawns were worth 1 Pawn for obvious reasons... unless they were made up of more than one Pawn. A Pawn made of 2 Pawns would be worth 2, just like a Rook made of 2 Rooks would be worth a value of 10 Pawns.\n\nThis version of the game was even harder than a traditional Rating Game, and Riser knew this. He was giving Rias the choice of the location, just so that he could decide the type of Rating Game. That or Ravel put him up to changing the type of Rating Game.\n\n\"Breakfast is ready Naruto!\" Asia came in skipping to the room with two plates of food in her hands, one for herself and one for Naruto. Naruto blinked and was forced from his thoughts when the plate filled with bacon and eggs was placed in front of him.\n\n\"Thank you Asia-chan! I really like your food.\" Naruto said with a smile on his face as he looked her right in the eyes, the truth in his words shining into his eyes and showing her that he was being honest with his compliment. She blushed slightly at actually being complimented over her cooking skills, before she sat down next to Naruto despite the fact that there was an entire table for her to sit at, but to Naruto he wouldnm't have her sit anywhere else but besides him.\n\n\"Thank you Na-\" Asia started before Naruto cut her off by standing up and hopping slightly to the side so that he was now sitting in her lap with his arms crossed and a serious expression on his face. Asia was shocked into silence for a moment at the fact that Naruto was now sitting in her lap, and doing so without any shame... not that he had shame in simply sitting in somebodies lap. Asia was about to start speaking again, before she was stunned again when Naruto lifted his legs and spun around so that he was face to face with her. She then felt him wrap his legs around her waist so that she couldn't escape without taking him with her, and she noticed as well that Naruto still had his arms crossed the entire time that he had been sitting in her lap.\n\n\"I am not a patient person Asia, and when I want something I go for it... screw what others think.\" Naruto stated with his arms crossed and a firm expression on his face, and Asia was immediently confused as to why naruto was bringing up something seemingly so random. She had to admit that she noticed that about Naruto, along with the fact that he was extremely kind when he wanted to be, and most of the time only thought of others, even she could see that if Naruto wanted something done or wanted something he was going to get it even if he had to cross paths with resistance.\n\n\"O-okay? What does that have to do with bacon and eggs though?\" Asia asked in her own innocent way of talking, while Naruto's face took on a slightly confused expression for a split second. He forgot that Asia didn't know his personality as well as somebody like Rias, so he had to be a bit more open with what he was trying to say instead of just hinting at it.\n\n\"Nothing, but I do like how crispy you make the bacon, and you cook the eggs just right... that is beside the point though. I like you Asia, and I don't want to wait until it is too late to tell you that ever since I met you I have had romantic feelings towards you. I want you to become mine Asia.\" Naruto stated as bluntly as he could, and the blonde girl's face first showed a very large amount of shock when she heard that Naruto had feelings for her. She noticed that he didn't tell her that he loved her, and used the work like instead. She didn't know if there was anything to that, or if he just liked the word like more than saying love, but she didn't really mind at this point in time. Frankly, she had a bigger issue on her hands just by the fact that Naruto was bluntly stating to her that he had romantic feelings towards her while sitting on her lap and facing her with that determined... yet cute... expression on his face that was both adorable and serious at the same time.\n\n\"B-but aren't you getting married?\" Asia asked with her face falling when she remembered that Naruto was indeed going to get married if Rias did win this Rating Game thing against this Riser person. She wasn't selfish enough to make Naruto cheat on his wife just so that she could have him, before she looked up swiftly when she heard Naruto snort slightly.\n\n\"I am one step away from being a High-Class Devil, and in the Underworld harems aren't uncommon for those of the upper class. I don't have romantic feelings for Ravel-chan, it is as simple as that. I might one day gain those feelings, I have a feeling that she won't mind if I have another girlfriend even if I have to marry her. She comes from the family that produces the most men with harems, so she is used to them by now. Her brothers have, or had, them, I am pretty sure her father once had one time.\" Naruto responded without arrogance in his voice, and while he would have prefered to just be with Asia and not be with Ravel at all, he knew that legally Lord Gremory was able to do this and it was a binding agreement. He couldn't just refuse or divorse Ravel without some serious shit being thrown around because of his actions, not to mention that he liked the Gremory family for taking his family in off the streets. He wasn't about to throw their name into the mud just because he didn't want to marry a girl that he was slightly fond of, and had an amazing body. The only real issue Naruto even had with marrying Ravel was that she was of higher standing than him, so he would be taking her last name because of the fact that it was tradition for lower classes to take the last name of those of higher class.\n\n\"H-h-harem!?\" Asia almost shouted the term in shock, having never even considered the fact that Naruto might be able to still fall in love with other people even if he got married. Here she was thinking this whole time that Naruto would be stuck in a loveless marraige for the rest of his life, while the whole time he wasn't in danger of not finding love... she really needed to learn more about devils.\n\n\"Yes, a harem... it is a disgusting thing I know, and frankly if I had to pick between Ravel-chan and you then you would win hands down, but I owe Lord Gremory for letting Rias keep me and my sister.\" Naruto admitted with a slight sigh to his voice. As an endangered species, Rias wasn't allowed to have true legal ownership over him or his sister until they had become part of her peerage. She had been too young at the time, so the legal parts of the 'adoption' had been placed in Lord Gremory's name. You just don't trust a small girl with the legal ownership of two of the last three of an entire species, it just wasn't done. So it was thanks to both Sirzechs and Lord Gremory that Naruto and Koneko were living the comfy lives they were. Naruto owed them for the last few happy years of his life that he had gotten to enjoy, years that he wouldn't trade away for anything.\n\n\"You would pick me?\" Asia whispered to herself with her head tilted down in that cute way that she did, and Naruto nodded to her.\n\n\"Without hesitating in the slightest... I did risk war for you after all. Of course I would pick you over another cute girl, I would pick you over a hundred cute girls. Heck, if a thousand girls came to my doorstep and begged me to join my harem I would turn them away right off the bat if it meant I could have you.\" Naruto explained even further, because he could not understand what Asia was finding hard to understand about what he was saying. Naruto sighed when he noticed her blushing and looking away, before he uncrossed his arms and started to go scoot closer to her so that his crotch was pressing against her gut. Asia blushed even deeper that the scooting action, and the fact he was pressing against even more of her... her blush then increased to the maximum level when Naruto wrapped his arms around her shoulders and leaned in so that his nose was pressing into her neck.\n\n\"Naru-\" Asia started before being rudely interupted by Naruto again.\n\n\"Did you know that the a Nekoshou can use their saliva to mark their mate by licking the neck of our partner over and over until the saliva seeps into the bloodstream and causes a chain reaction? The hormones in my saliva will cause a reaction that will make you start to create the very same hormone I used to mark you as mine. The change in permanent, and no other Youkai will find you attractive... you will be mine, and nobody else can have you. I want you Asia... tell me what to do.\" Naruto stated to her as he opened his mouth so that his tongue was hanging out slightly, his burning hot breath hitting Asia's neck in a way that caused her to grow slightly... moist between her legs. This was something she couldn't help but find amazing, not because the breath felt good, but because it was Naruto's breath hitting her. She pressed her cheek into the side of his head and started to think about this entire situation. Naruto was giving HER the choice of if he marked her as his or not, meaning that he was letting her decide what she wanted to do from this point on. He was hiding nothing from her about his intention.\n\n\"Will it hurt... or leave a mark?\" Asia asked with her eyes looking up at the ceiling, and if she could blush more than she already was than she would, but going more red than this was impossible for her.\n\n\"It will sting a little, and you might get a headache. Your neck will be a little red from the licking, but that will fade... the change in internal, so nothing will change about your appearance. All that will be different about you is that you will start to produce a hormone that will make you unattractive to any other male that is sensative to smell, mostly Youkai. You won't turn into a devil or Youkai because of this.\" Naruto answered with a small roll of his eyes. He knew where the question was coming from though, because as a cat he was expected to mark his 'mate' with a bite or something... how cliche in his opinion. All biting her would do was hurt her, and cause a teeth shaped scar on her neck that would tarnish her blemish free skin. He wasn't going to do something like that, so he would take the long way and just keep licking her over and over until his saliva started to seep through the skin and enter the blood before reaching the brain.\n\nAsia would still be completely human, but her body would start to make a hormone to perfectly match his own that labled her as his. Anything with a good sense of smell would notice this, AND even if they didn't notice it the scent was the hormonal scent of a male. Other males would find this scent as a major turn off, so no matter how physically attractive Asia was, it was pretty much impossible for other men to find her attractive other than noticing the fact that she had a nice body in a neutal sort of way.\n\n\"... I want this.\" Asia finally said after a few moments, and she shivered when Naruto waisted zero time in running his wet tongue from the bottom of her neck to the point that his tongue touched the bottom of her ear. She shivered even more when Naruto placed one of his hands on the other side of her head to keep her steady, while the other hand went to her waist to keep himself steady on her lap.\n\nNaruto took his Asia's scent for the last time before it would change, and with each breath he memorized her smell before he used his tongue to mark her as his. Her moved his head again so that he was back at the bottom of her neck, and then he tasted her once more when he tongue drifted across her skin again. It would take awhile, but Naruto pressed his chest into her slight above average chest and pressed rthe side of his head into her cheek a bit deeper. The hand on her waist tightened slightly as his body pressed into hers, before he moved that hand up to a 'safe' location and tightened his hold on her body. With another wet lick to her moist skin, he furthered the process just a little bit more, before Asia winced when she felt his sharp fangs touch lightly against her skin with the next lick. Naruto moved his head back at the accident from his pressing too closely when licking her, before he looked at the spot and sighed with relief when he noticed that she wasn't bleeding from the touch of his fang.\n\nNaruto moved his tongue a bit further down so that his licking started at her collarbone, before he began to move up slowly and savored the unique taste that was Asia. The small amount of salt in the sweat that she had produced from her blush and the fact she was growing hot undet the collar, and then under that there was the light apple taste that came from who knows where. The last part of her taste wasn't actually her, but he enjoyed the bit of magic that was on her skin thanks to her skill and practice with her Sacred Gear. Naruto didn't stop at her ear though this time when he got to it, because he moved his tongue across her cheek and lightly touched against her lower lip before taking his mouth and kissing her very lightly. She gasped to herself over this, and Naruto went back to his task of marking her by licking her again.\n\nThis was going to be a lengthy process without directly placing his saliva in her blood, but it would be an enjoyable one for the both of them... of that he was sure as Asia wrapped her arms around his waist and pulled him closer to her.\n\nThis... was what they both wanted.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**I can change my mind about what I want to update at any time.**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t35. Chapter 35 The Day Before\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'What... what the hell happened in nine days to cause this?' Rias thought with wide eyes when the first thing she and the rest of her peerage that had been out training their asses off her cottage in the mountains thought when they teleported into the Occult Research Club's base of operations. Everyone had either looks of shock on their faces, or they were showing a smile when they gazed at the adorable seen in front of them. Something they had never expected to come back to... well, except a very annoyed Koneko who looked ready to punch the wall and destroy the room. No seriously, she was freaking out Issei, who was hiding with his hands on Yuuto's shoulders to push him in the way of Koneko is case he needed a meat shield.\n\n\"Ara ara, now isn't this a pleasant surprise.\" Akeno muttered with a wicked gleam in her eye when her eyes landed on the couch in the room after her moment of shock passed her. She should have expected this really, it wasn't like the signs of this happening weren't there to begin with. She was both happy about this interesting development, and worried about how it would affect the group as a whole... as well as some political backlash from this if it were ever to become public knowledge.\n\n'Pleasant isn't what I would call it, good job Naruto. You bagged yourself a little cutie.' Blaze thought as he went to go lean against the wall with a smirk on his face, before thayt smirk changed very slightly as he opened an eye to see Kalawarner leaning against the wall next to him with an matching smirk of her own. His smirk deepened, and her own widened before they regained their neutral expressions they normally had on during everyday life. Training had been rather easy for them, so they didn't have much to worry about at the moment. They had both been in great combat condition, with combat conditioning to go with it before becoming members of Rias' peerage. They trained againsdt each other the full nine days that they were at the freakishly big cottage the rich girl's family owned, and now that they were taking a day back at the home base to rest they had to admit they didn't get very much done other than getting used to their new bodies and their bodies limits. Of course, they weren't in the same league as those like Koneko, Akeno, Yuuto, and Rias at the moment, but Issei, Murayama, Katase, and Gasper were among those that could be defeated in skill and brain power if needed.\n\n\"Naruto... wake up... NOW!\" Rias barked out with a tone of absolute authority that screamed 'obey me or face hell' and that was a tone that everyone had gotten used to during the hellish training for the weaker, and the skill honing season for the stronger. She did have a good reason for her loud tone though, because the scene in front of them would be the most disturbing to the only natural born devil of the group.\n\nNaruto and Asia... were currently laying together on the couch asleep in a way that showed that they had been that way for while, and they were in a pose that would make their intimate feelings mpore well broadcasted to the group. Naruto was laying his head back against the arm rests of the couch, and his head tilted to the right so that his cheek was resting on top of the blonde hair of the girl that had her face resting in the crook of his neck. A look of contentness was easily seen on both of their faces, and while the position was a littl awkward because of the fact that Asia was taller than Naruto so her feet were on the other end of the couch, it was still a nice seen that she was laying on top of him with their chests against each other. Naruto had his arms wrapped around Asia in a form of comfort, like she was a big teddy bear a child would use to sleep with. Asia's hands were resting on the sides of his rips so that she could hold him as well, but one person was able to immediently pick up on something that nobody else picked up right away.\n\n'Her smell has changed... she has brother's scent mixed with it... he didn't!' Koneko thought when her eyes widened and then narrowed to such small slits that you would think that she was doing an imitation of a angry cat... not an imitation in this case when she really was an angry cat that was barely holding back her emotions. She knew her species well enough to know what it meant when ones scent was mixed into another person's natural scent, it meant that they had been marked as theirs. The person that they truly wished to seek out an emotional relationship with... one did not simply mark a person and not have romantic feelings for them. She had no idea what brought this on, but she knew that shje couldn't hurt Asia over it... Naruto would without a doubt get more angry than she had ever seen him if she attacked the one that he had pretty much confessed his feelings to Asia by marking her. Once you mark somebody, nobody else can mark them and you can't undo what you have done.\n\nThis was pretty much the Youkai equal to marraige, only there was no such thing as divorce in this bonding.\n\nHer frustration intensified when she saw Asia roll over slightly with Naruto so that now they had switched positions with the lighter boy now on top of her with his head rested between her breasts... even though she was wearing PJs on, it was still a pretty arousing thing for somebody if they were awake to feel it.\n\n\"That is perhaps the cutest thing I have... are you okay Gasper-kun?\" Yuuto asked with a raised eyebrow when he noticed that Gasper was looking at the cuddling couple with a light look of jealousy on his face. Gasper blinked lightly, before he blushed and looked away from Yuuto and nodded.\n\n\"Yeah... but this is the first time I have seen Naruto-kun sleep with somebody like this without knowing them for years.\" Gasper admit to being a little jealous of the situation that Asia was getting in. Normally Naruto wouldn't even sleep in the same bed as somebody unless he had known them for long enough to be good friends, or they were a cute girl that he was sure wouldn't take advantage of his knocked out body. This thing didn't usually happen when somebody was in Rias peerage, so he was pretty comfy around them, but he had to admit that it had taken Naruto awhile to warm up to him and some other members of the peerage... mostly Akeno with her bullying tendencies when they were younger... or at least he was told she had been like Naruto's personal bully when they were younger. By the time he had joined the peerage Akeno had gone from sadistic bully to a sadistic friend.\n\n\"Why...?\" Issei mumbled something under his breath in a tone that had everyone awake curious as to what he was talking about. Issei's hair was overshadowing his eyes, and his jaw was trembling for some reason. Rias walked over to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder to see what was wrong, before she jumped back in shock when Isseiu lifted his face back into view and everyone could see that a look of absolute horror was on his face. \"Why don't I feel like perving on Asia!?\" Issei shouted in horror when he realized that Asia just wasn't attractive to him anymore, even in this cute position in her PJs she wasn't cute in the sexy way. Right now he only saw her cute in the way you would look at a puppy thta was trying to run, but kept falling down on it's sides or bumping into things while trying to bite it's tail. His sexual desire for her just wasn't there anymore, he couldn't even force himself to get a chubby even if he wanted to at this moment. It was like Asia was a cute girl, but right now she smelled absolutely horrible to him to such a level that it was effecting his ability to even think sexual thoughts about her.\n\nEveryone was surprised though when something flew through the air was was about to smack Issei in the face, before Yuuto caught it with his hands and sent the slowly moving Naruto a look of amusement when he noticed that Naruto had thrown a rubber duck at Issei with enough force behind it to knock him off his feet... if the stinging in his hand was anything to go by.\n\n\"Nyaaaaaa...\" Naruto yawned out with his arms outstretched to get any tightness out of them. Murayama and Katase gushed silently in their own heads at how adorable a Nekoshou, that was proud of their heritage, yawn could be with just the word nya and a simple stretching of the arms. Naruto looked down at the fact he was straddling Asia's stomach, before he placed his hand on her shoulder and started to shake her awake before he noticed that everyone was in the room with them. His eyes became more aware of his surrounding right away, before he looked down at himself with a shocked look... not because they were seeing him straddling Asia, or that they had fallen asleep last night when Naruto was reading Asia a book about some of the more interestring history lessons in the Underworld. Nope, what he was horrified about was the fact that everyone could see what kind of pajamas Naruto wore.\n\nNormally he only slept in boxers, but unlike Rias Naruto knew that doing that with Asia so soon after marking her as his would be a mistake. The girl was human, so to her she wouldn't feel the same rush of emotion just by being around him as soon as he felt his affection for her grow just by being around her scent. Naruto didn't want to scare her by moving too quickly, and he could wait awhile for her to get adjusted to the changed. Her body had just started to produce the 'Mate Hormone' as some liked to call it, so she wouldn't be noticing the emotions and slightly sexual attraction increase at this point... or at all, she was human so she wasn't nearly as sensative to the smell of hormones as he was.\n\nThat was why Naruto was wearing the pajamas Akeno had gotten him a few years ago, the pajamas that were pure white in color. The boxer-shorts were white, and the short sleeves top was white as well, but the embarrassing part was the fact that connected to the top was a hoodie with white cat ears attached to it.\n\nThings only started to get worse when Asia started to stir, and her eyes began to lightly flutter open before her hands went up to her face while balled into fists so that she could rub her eyes in an attempt to get the desire for more sleep out of her system. She leaned up into a sitting position, not noticing the others in the room yet, only seeing Naruto in front of her with a smile on her face.\n\n\"Morning Naruto-kun... last night was, yawn, so much fun. I didn't know about any of that fun stuff you taught... me?\" Asia thanked him in a kind tone of voice, that slowly morphed into one of confusion when she noticed the sound of tapping in the room. Looking over to the the sound of the tapping, she noticed that Rias had her arms crossed under her breats and was looking down at them with an irritated expression clear to even the most of oblivious.\n\n\"Good morning Naruto-kun, Asia-CHAN... how was your little break while all of us were busting out butts training?\" Rias asked with a deadly tone filled with acid. Naruto jumped from Asia and landed on the other side of the couch, while Asia sat up even straighter and turned so that she was facing Rias and the others behind her looking at the new couple in amusement. Naruto had a 'cat that didn't catch the canary' look on his face, because it would seem that he had hoped to keep his new relationship status a secret from the others for awhile. Asia was just embarrassed that everyone was looking at her in her pajamas, because they weren't cute in the slightest like Naruto's. They were just plain pants and a matching shirt. She and Naruto had been reading a book together last night, and this room had some pretty good couches and the bookshelves had some good books in them.\n\n\"Hahaha, I guess we were caught nya.\" Naruto said while rubbing the back of his head when his worry changed to amusement, while Rias just sighed at the way he didn't seem to be sorry about his actions at all. Rias shook her head and smiled lightly, before looking at Naruto with a gentle expression.\n\n\"As long as you are happy, then I am fine with it... just be sure to wear protection. Asia-san, take good care of Naruto-kun, he can be a idiot at times so you should keep a close eye on him.\" Rias finally said after a few moments, and with her words came her permission for Asia to date her servant and best friend. She knew Naruto, and if he was really this serious about being with somebody then she couldn't take that away from him. She knew that Devils of high status usually formed harems, so this wouldn't be much of a problem for the changed contract with the Phenex. After all, Riser had a harem at the moment that he regularly did the deed with, and she was still expected to marry him if she lost the Rating Game. That would mean that Ravel and Lord Phenex couldn't complain without looking like fools if Naruto were to already have a lover before getting married. She herself only had a few problems with Naruto dating Asia, problems she would make known to Asia the next time the two were alone together.\n\n\"Why would Naruto need to wear protection?\" Asia asked innocently, while Naruto sent a look at Rias for stating something that didn't need to be stated.\n\n'That is such a hot thought... why can't this get me excited then?!' Issei thought as he collapsed to the floor on his hands and knees in wonder at how such things weren't getting him excited when they came from Asia.\n\n\"I got this.\" Akeno stated with a smile on her face as she walked to Asia and sat down on the couch next to the girl, before she leaned in and put her mouth next to the girl's ear. \"You see Asia-chan, when a guy and a girl like each other... he gives the girl a whip and lets her beat him over and over again until he is crying out her name in pleasure.\" Akeno whispered to the naive girl, and Asia seemed to be truly convinced that she was going to have to use a whip on Naruto that she had a look of horror on her face. Akeno didn't get much farther in her explaination of her own version of sex, before she was smacked in the back of the head by a now standing Naruto.\n\n\"Bad Akeno, very bad Akeno.\" Naruto reprimanded with a firm tone, and she held the back of her head while sticking her tongue out at him. Naruto went back next to Asia once Akeno got up from the couch, before he crossed his arms and looked at Rias with a serious expression. \"You will be glad that I stayed here when you hear what I need to tell you nya. Riser has declared that intsead of a regular Rating Game, you two will be using the special rules known as the Dife Figure Game. If I hadn't stayed here, then you would have been left in the dark until tomorrow nya.\" Naruto mentioned, and Rias' eyes widened at the new news that all her planning in the last nine days had been completely pointless. She placed her hand on her chin, before she smirked very lightly. This could work in her favor if she played her cards right, because Riser would most likely have a high value meaning that unless they both rolled high enough then Riser wouldn't even be able to fight in his own Rating Game. He wouldn't be able to even use his entire peerage, which made her question why he would do this.\n\nSomething didn't add up.\n\n\"Everyone go home and rest, I have some plans I need to change.\" Rias ordered as she sat down on the couch opposite to Naruto and Asia with a heavy sigh. Now she would have to pick teams based on possible numbers that would come up, and players that she would send out if... if... she just figured out why Riser was doing this. Naruto, Akeno, and herself were worth between 5 and 9, meaning that if they were picked then she wouldn't be able to pick as many others for her side. The three of them were the biggest threats to Riser and his peerage, meaning that he was applying the pressure on her to chose only them and very few others. If she picked Naruto, then she highly doubted that she would be able to use very many others.\n\n\"Hey Naruto, can I talk to you for a bit?\" Issei asked the younger boy with a hopeful expression on his face while the rest of the peerage were leaving the room. Naruto blinked a few times, before he nodded and stood up from the couch so that the only people in the room were Rias and Asia. Rias was too busy in her own thoughts about teams to notice this though, so Naruto and Issei were able to go out in the hallway without any trouble or anyone caring.\n\n\"What did you want to talk about Issei nya?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow as he tilted his head and looked up at Issei. He had to admit that he was very curious as to what Issei was going to ask him. He was surprised when Issei got on his hands and knees with his forehead to the ground not even moments later, because frankly most people didn;t bow before him unless they were trying to suck up to Rias or get on his good side.\n\n\"Please teach me how to become strong!?\" Issei requested truthfully, and Naruto blinked again before Issei noticed that he had actually stunned Naruto with his request to gain strength. Without lifting his head, Issei sighed and looked at the floor with an annoyed expression. \"I am the weakest person in Buchou's peerage, and you are the strongest. I want to be stronger so that I can prove to everyone that Buchou didn't make a mistake in reincarnating me as a Devil. I don't want to bring her any shame, so I beg that you teach me how to be strong.\" Issei requested with his honest desire reaching Naruto, who simply smirked and nodded lightly. He could get behind something like this.\n\n\"Okay Issei, I will train you. Lets show everyone that even a person without any talent for fighting can be pretty awesome with the right teacher and lots of hard work!\" Naruto said with a wide smile on his face. He had to admit, that Issei's Magic Reserves had been growing slightly from all the training that Akeno had been giving Issei in manipulating and controlling his magic in the form of that one spell he had created... that Naruto still hadn't seen in action. Even if Issei lacked raw power, Naruto would give him the tools to be a smart fighter instead of a strong fighter if that was what it took to make Issei a good Pawn to Rias. Naruto knew for a fact that Yuuto had taken both Katase and Murayama under his wing as swordwomen, which left Issei without a real teacher for his style. Akeno was good at physical fighting and magic, but what Issei needed was somebody to help him teach him how to think outside of the box and use what he already has to his advantage and give him the tools to become a great fighter even if he wasn't going to be the type to have a lot of raw power at his beck and call.\n\n\"Thank you so much Naruto! You won't regret this!\" Issei shouted from a now standing position with determination deep in his eyes, while Naruto started to walk back into the room, knowing that just because he would be training Issei, didn't mean he would be neglecting his own training. Of course, there was still one cause for concern.\n\nThe Rating Game tomorrow, and what happened after the battle was done.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**The Rating Game starts next chapter.**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t36. Chapter 36 The Calm Before the Storm\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Naruto's current height is the same as during the first season of Naruto, 4 Feet 7 Inches. Making him 1 inch taller than Koneko at 4 feet 6 inches.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nTen, the number after Nine and before Eleven.\n\nTen was a number that Naruto had hated for most of his life without even knowing why he hated that number. Everything bad that happened seemed to happen on the tenth, at ten-o-clock, or during October. Oh god, he would have hated to have been born 10-10 at ten at night. That would be like the ultimate way to jinx himself with a hatred for the number ten... who knows, maybe in a past life he had some kind of real reason for hating the number ten. Maybe in a past life he had lost somebody important to him on the tenth, or he fought against some kind of demon or something that was related to the number ten. Maybe he lost something important to a beast with ten tails that had taken something from him on the tenth of october... of course, that couldn't POSSIBLY be true.\n\nNaruto liked the numbers Two and Nine more than ten, but right now Naruto was pretty damn happy to see the number ten from where he was standing. You see, when Riser and Rias had met today to roll the dice the number that had appeared had been the number that Naruto hated. Riser had rolled a four, and Rias had rolled the number six, adding up to the hated number. That meant that both Rias and Riser could pick from their peerages the Value of people that added up to a total of ten... sadly for Rias she hrself couldn't be picked as a team player. The judges had told her that she and Riser were being given a value of ten and twelve, so while she could fight, she would have to do it alone. Something that would be foolish on her part, but on the good news Riser himself wouldn't be able to take part in this battle.\n\nTen.\n\nRias had picked the people that she would be sending out to battle, and the first person that she had picked was surprisingly Issei. She was counting his his perversion and the new move he had been bragging about to give the other person she picked the chance to finish off opponents in the moments they were shocked into not moving away from defeat. Apparently Rias thought this new move... the Dress Break, as it turns out it stripped people of clothing, weapons, and other enchantments along with them, and left them showing everything to the world. It was a perverts move made by the pervert of the school that was the leader of other perverts. Rias had also told Naruto that Issei had created another new move during the nine days that they had spent training him with his magic, but she had refused to tell him what that move actually was.\n\nThat left a value of nine left for Rias to use, and use that value she was going to when she picked the next person for her team of battlers. Somebody that she was placing a lot of faith in for the outcome of this battle.\n\nNaruto, making that value of nine drop all the way down to zero, meaning that Rias could no longer use anymore pieces at her disposal because the two of them added up to the number ten. Issei the Pawn was worth 1, and Naruto the Queen was worth the remaining 9, meaning that the two of them would have to take on anyone that Riser sent against them on their own.\n\nNaruto and Issei, the highest ranking member in Rias' peerage, and the lowest of the low of her peerage. A team made in Heaven or Hell depending on the point of view.\n\n\"Is it normal to feel like throwing up?\" Issei commented as he an Naruto stood in the middle of the club room all alone, just waiting for the game to start. You see, the game itself wouldn't be taking place in the human world.\n\nRating Games were played while the teams were inside a sealed place created to be the mirror image of what one of the players wanted it to be. They had yet to be taken to that space, so as of yet they were waiting to be teleported to the sealed space so that they could begin the battle. Right now the sealed space had been set up already, a location that Rias had decided upon by allowing Naruto to explain a place to her that he had seen inside one of his many vivid dreams that he could remember. At this moment they were waiting for Riser to pick the people from his peerage that would be taking place in battle, and the viewing moniters were being placed in the sealed space so that the entire battle could be recorded for other devils and creatures all over the Underworld to watch at their own leasure. There would also be a live viewing of the battle for those related to those in the battle, or that had some sort of high standing connection that allowed them to view the battle itself.\n\n\"I wouldn't know, I am pretty damn excited for this to begin though nya.\" Naruto said with a certain amount of his natural Youkai bloodlust leaking into his normal tone. He wanted the fight to begin already so that he could show the Underworld just who the hell he was, and why he should be given another chance for promotion to High-Class. Then he would be able to soar through the ranks even quicker than any other Devil in history, thus gaining himself more fame and leading to more promotion chances being given to him for being of high reputation. Then he could rise even quicker and quicker until he not only went above the usual High-Class ranking, but went into the ranks of the Ultimate-Class. Then, once he was an Ultimate-Class he would be able to claim unclaimed land in the Underworld as his own land, and with his land he would had a sancuary for his race once they bloomed again.\n\n\"O-okay, but where are we doing this... Buchou said that she was letting you pick the battle place or something like that?\" Issei asked with a confused look on his face, while Naruto smirked a wide smirk. He had picked a place that he was very familiar with in his own dreams, one of the places that appeared more than any other place. It was always the same dream as well, but each time Naruto had this dream it became more and more clear to him. This place was somewhere that they would have a complete area advantage simply because Riser had never played in such a location before, and he had never been given the chance to learn about the area because it was a place from Naruto's dreams.\n\n\"You will see Issei, you will see.\" Naruto said with a grin, before he stood up and stretched his limbs so that he would be ready for the battle. Seeing that they had a bit of time left before the match began, Naruto went over to the bag that he had brought with him and started to remove what was inside of the bag. Inside the bag were clothed that Naruto had requested made for him, a gift from Sirzechs to serve him in battle should he ever need them. Issei raised an eyebrow when Naruto started to strip himself of his current Kuoh Academy men's uniform, before he tossed them into a pile on the couch. He didn't even care if Issei saw him in his boxers, frankly he was fine with his sexuality enough to not care if he was stripping around others. Issei on the other hand was about to have a mini heart attack at the thought that something bad was about to happen to him, but then he silently wished to himself that he could get as toned as Naruto.\n\nThe small white haired boy might not have abs, mostly because of his size and age combined with what race he was, but his body was toned to near perfection. Issei finally sighed in relief when Naruto started to pull clothes out of the bag, before the first thing that Issei noticed Naruto pulling from the bag were a pair of orange... strange color... shorts. Naruto slipped the shorts on before he zipped them up and buttoned them, showing that the shorts came to just under his knees. Naruto then pulled out a very dark blue T-shirt with a deep v for the neck and put it on to cover his chest and stomach, and Issei wondered about the strange clothes for battle before Naruto pulled out another orange piece of clothing. This piece of clothing was the same shade of orange as the pants, but unlike the pants it was a jacket with no sleeves. The collar of the jacket stuck up against the sides of his neck, and going down the middle was a zipper. With the final piece of the clothing on, Naruto reached into the bag and pulled out some blue sandles that he strapped to his feet moments later.\n\nThis was the outfit he had requested that Sirzechs have ordered for him, something that he had pictured in his head awhile ago that he thought would look good on him. Anyway, Naruto had asked for these clothes to be made from a highly fire resistant material just for this battle, being able to resist many kinds of flames and having a first stage of defence against them would come in handy when Riser's entire peerage knew how to use some form of Fire based magic. That was the one thing in common that all of them had, they each mainly used fire, fists, and weapons as their main form of fighting. These clothes were made from a pretty tough material as well, so they would be able to resist and soften the blows from stronger hits as well before tearing. Naruto smacked his own head moments later before he reached back into the bag and pulled out a long piece of black cloth and started to tie it around his forehead. It was just a plain black cloth, but it did it's job and kept Naruto's shaggy hair out of his eyes so that it wouldn't become a hazard for him during the battle.\n\n'I am still pretty nervous, but with how calm Naruto is I can't help but feel a little better.' Issei thought with a small amount of sweat on his face from the fact he actually was pretty nervous about this coming battle.\n\nHe hoped that he didn't have to fight anyone too strong.\n\n**-With Riser's Chosen Fighters-**\n\n\"Lady Ravel, are you sure that you wish to fight in this battle?\" A fair skinned woman with pitch black hair and bright greenish blue eyes. She had a v shaped fringe of hair in front of her head, and on each side of her head was chinese buns with white cloth around them. Her long hair that wasn't in the bun easily went down to the bottom of her shoulders. She wore a very revealing chinese dress that showed off her large bust and cleavage, and her arms with no sleeves. The dress was blue with golden accents, and around her gut was a white sash. She wore no pants, but the fact she was in a dress that had slits going up both legs made this more obvious, and on her arms were black armguards.\n\n\"Xuelan, you may be Onii-san's Rook and be worth more pieces, but remember who you are talking to.\" The girl that could be assumed to be Ravel stated with a frown on her face. Ravel was a young girl Naruto's age with a bit more height to her than him, with her being at least 5 feet tall with her long blonde hair kept to the sides of her hair in drill-like curled ponytails. Her bangs went down almost to her dark blue eyes, and her body was both petite and mature at the same time from the fact that she had rather moderately sized breasts on a petite body. Her posture was one befitting of somebody of high-class, and she had a slight bit of arrogance in her tone from being raised as a high-class devil. Right now she wasn't dressed like she was a High-Class devil, because instead of her usual way of dressing in dresses she was wearing something that wouldn't hinder her in battle. Simple clothes really, just a dark purple V-neck T-shirt designed by her family with a flame immunity, and a black skinny jeans so that she would have some coverage on her legs, while still showing off her looks.\n\n\"I understand Lady Ravel, and apologize for my words.\" Xuelan commented with a small bow and a frown on her face, not from how Ravel had talked to her, but from the fact that this would be the first time that Ravel had really fought somebody in a Rating Game. She was usually the brains behind them, not the muscle to actually do the job fighting. She had never even seen Ravel fighting before, so while her strength was obvious because of her family and natural abilities, it was hard to say if she had any real experience in a fight or not. Her Phenex blood combined with her strengthened magic and increased Bishop reserves would make her more powerful than the average High-Class devil from the Phenex family, but she was still young.\n\n\"I do not mean to be harsh Xuelan, but I am a little nervous. I have been training for this battle with Naruto-kun, but I will admit that I have never really been in true combat before. This will be a first for me, so my nerves on on edge.\" Ravel corrected her earlier tone to her brothers servant. She had to admit that even after having her brother familiar spy on Naruto and his training, she wasn't 100 percent sure of her chances of victory. The last time she had seen Naruto in person, her brother had greatly pissed Naruto off... the result was the fact that even their families healing couldn't heal the scar on her brothers face from Naruto's teeth when he was mauling Riser. They had to actually resort to using Phoenix Tears to correct the facial damage, showing that if she wasn't careful she could actually get hurt.\n\n\"Heh, I just want to watch the blood flow from whatever Pawn they send with the Queen.\" A young girl with green hair tied with a small yellow ribbon to the left side of her head. She wore a white shirt with black biker shorts, and she was actually shorter than Ravel with a slightly immature body. In her hands was a blue colored chainsaw... yes, a chainsaw. This was one of Riser's Pawns Nel, and unlike what she normally did she would be entering this battle without her twin sister.\n\n\"Keep yourself in check Nel, the blood will flow soon enough. The pieces of Rias Gremory can't be that strong.\" A girl with her blue hair tied up in four ponytails on the sides of her head stated with a frown, and she simply wore a white haori with a red obi, and on top of that she had on a red happai cloak. In her hands was a long wooden pole with ball cloth balls at the ends. Her brown eyes glinted with suspicion for a moment when she thought about why she was chosen for this fight, before she shrugged it off as Riser's choice.\n\n\"Do not underestimate Naruto-kun Mira and Nel, he is of the nearly exitinct Nekoshou race. You were once a human before being turned, and your piece is the Pawn. He was a Youkai with powers of his own before being turned into the Queen of Rias Gremory's peerage and gaining Queen traits. Among Youkai, the Nekoshou are considered a High-Class Youkai. That means that he far outranks you and Nel, so you two avoid him if you want to stay in the game.\" Ravel warned thuthfully, it was part of the reason that her family didn't midnt he fact that she had requested the contract changed so that she could marry Naruto. He might be a Middle-Class Devil, but he was a High-Class Youkai meaning that his status was great enough so that he was a threat to her family if he truly used his all to fight against them. He was somebody that even her brother didn't underestimate simply because of his Reincarnated Devil status, his High-Class Youkai status more than made up for the lower Devil status.\n\n\"Understood Lady Ravel.\" Nel said with a small pout on her face, but relented. Even Riser had told them to solely focus on the weaker pieces and leave the Queen to Ravel and Xuelan. Riser had predicted that Rias would send her strongest piece out if given the chance, so he would be sending out two of his strongest pieces out after him. Ravel was a High-Class Devil from the Phenex family, while Xuelan was a Rook that had the physical strength and general fighting ability of a Queen. That would mean that they would have the best chance of beating Naruto if they worked together.\n\n\"I... will not try and fight him then.\" Mira agreed upon Ravel's words, even if she would have prefered to think of her opponents as weak, she had to admit that she had not been aware of Naruto's status among Youkai, just his status amonmg Devils.\n\n\"Seriously, you two leave him to us. You can't win against him, even if you Promote to Queen. He holds the records for the youngest Reincarnated Devil to ever take the Promotion Exams and pass them twice. One more exam and he will hold the record for the youngest Reincarnated Devil to become a High-Class Devil. Do. Not. Fight. Him.\" Xuelan ordered the Pawns right after Ravel with a glare on her face. She was serious about this, just as serious as Ravel was when she had said that Naruto was out of the league of most of her brother's peerage in single combat. All the Pawns could team up together and they would still lose without landing a real hit on him.\n\nThen, out of nowhere there was white flash telling them that they were all being taken to the location of the battle.\n\nThe Rating Game between Rias Gremory and Riser Phenex... had begun.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**New Poll: Where will the battle take place?**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t37. Chapter 37 The Rating Game\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nIssei's eyes widened in shock when the white flash was finished and he and Naruto both were teleported away to the site that would decided the future for both Rias and Naruto himself. He first noticed that he was standing on the side of a cliff, and when he looked down he noticed that it wasn't a cliff he was standing on. What he was actually on top of was a large stone statue of a man with long straight hair wearing some kind of old fashion armor from Japanese descent, and the man's hands were in front of him in some kind of hand sign. At the bottom of the man's feet were a moderately large lake that was resting on the inside of a large hole in the ground, with a waterfall fueling the lake with water. Issei looked out on the other side of the man, only to see that the entire world out of this area seemed to just be... nothing. Like there wasn't anything there to begin with. The waterfall and river leading to this place seemed to actually come from nowhere at all. Issei felt Naruto nudge him in the side and point in front of them, and that was when Issei noticed that there was another stone statue of a man wearing similar armor with spiky long hair that went down his back, and his hands in the same symbol.\n\nHe never noticed as the white area around them started to turn into a large forest, because at this moment he was paying attention to the fact that standing on the opposite head was Riser's peerage members.\n\n\"Issei, to promote you have to be standing on top of the opposite head. Think you can manage without getting defeated?\" Naruto questioned without looking at Issei, his eyes trained on the other group for the second they made their move. Right now it was just them trying to figure out where they were, and what they were going to be doing for the battle. The boy gulped in fear, mainly because he couldn't use his wings for flight yet meaning that he would have to go to the bottom of the canyon before climbing back up to the other side, or going through the river and waterfall by swimming so that he could promote to Queen. If he couldn't promote and Naruto got defeated, then he was pretty much F'd up the A with a rusty metal spoon while singing folk songs.\n\nIssei felt a hand on his chest, and looking down he noticed that Naruto had a hand extended... before he felt himself launched through the air and faling down towards the lake below the statues, and he was screaming like a frightened little girl the entire time down. Naruto sweat dropped with a light chuckle, but then his face became serious and he got himself ready for anything that could be thrown at him. Naruto stomped his foot into the head under him, and just as his foot went inside the head he yanked it back out and a boulder of rock came out of the earth under him. Placing his hand on the boulder, he used it as a shield just in time when a large stream of flames burst towards him. The boulder started to melt right away from the heat of the fire, but the flames went around the boulder instead of touching him.\n\n\"Ahhhh... it's freaking cold!\" Issei shouted could be heard after a big spash was heard from the water down below, and the flames heading towards him seemed to weaken a small when Ravel looked down towards the lake to see Issei trying his hardest to swim towards the shore. Naruto used the lesser flames coming at him as his chance to counter by jumping up slightly and using his legs to kick the boulder towards the enemy group, and the boulder soared through the flames without trouble. The flames were forced to stop when Ravel and her backup summoned their devil, flaming wings in Ravel's case, and flew off the stone head just as the boulder destroyed a section of the rock on the opposite head.\n\n'They are splitting up?' Naruto thought when two of the devils started to head towards him, while the other two started to fly down towards Issei as he got out of the water. Knowing that it would take a few second sfor the two fighting him to arrive here, he started to build up of bit of his power in preperation for the fight to come. Every little bit of his power that he could use for this fight would help him as much as possible, even if he only managed to charge up a little power for an attack before they had managed to land on the head in front of him. He saw that the ones that were going after him were Xuelan and Ravel herself, meaning that the two Pawns were going after Issei without knowing what areas would lead to promotion... that was good for Issei.\n\n\"Prepare yourself Queen of the Gremory.\" Xuelan stated with a small amount of anticipation and fear in her voice as she charged at Naruto at a surprising speed for somebody that was labled as a Rook. Her speed waqs nearly a fifth of that of a Knight, making her somebody that was immediently placed on the Threat Level list of people that could actually be a problem. Naruto riased his forearm and blocked a flaming fist from the girl, before he jumped and did a backflip to avoid a flaming kick from the girl, ember following her foot as she attacked him with everything she had at the start of the fight. She knew holding back even a small amount of her skill and power would give Naruto the chance to land the finishing blow. She would need to keep him as close as possible so that he couldn't use the Knight speed granted to the Queen, and the best way to do that was to press her advantage as soon as possible and give him no chance to get any distance.\n\n\"Nice to see you in person again Naruto-kun, and I wish it were under better conditions.\" Ravel stated with a small smile on her face as she raised her hand and summoned a small ball of fire that began to grow larger and larger in her palm. Naruto looked over to her, but was forced to dirvert a quick flaming kick from Xuelan. The girl spun her body and leg around so tyat the same leg was coming back for a second kick, and in responce Naruto bent backwards again to narrowily avoid the kick, but he had to wince when the flames from the kick nearly licked at his face from how close it was. Xuelan took a quick step away from Naruto when Ravel finished charging her attack and used her wings flames to increased her speed so that she could get in point blank with Naruto just as he stood back up straight again, and with the orb of flames pointed at his face he used the power that he had built up earlier to create a Youjutsu Bubble. \"Sorry, but as much as I want to marry you, my brother also wants Rias and family comes first. See you later Darling.\" Ravel stated as an explosion of flames erupted from her hand and blew up the spot that Naruto was currently at. Flames covered everything on the head in front of Ravel, but she blinked when the flames stated to vanish at a very rapid rate.\n\nThe air around the flames twisted and twirled to her as the flames started to spiral towards where Naruto was supposed to be. Ravel nodded lightly in approval when she saw a mostly uninjured Naruto holding a bubble in his hands the size of a basketball, and inside the bubble were her own flames that he had absorbed into the bubble before they could do him any real damage. Naruto hopped away as Xuelan jumped back into action again now that she wasn't in danger of being caught in an explosion, so throwing the Flame Bubble at Xuelan when she got in close, he clicked his teeth when the bubble started to soar towards Ravels outstretched hand before she started to absorb the flame filled bubble itself as her own magic returned to her, filling her to full power. Naruto blocked a strong kick with his left arm, before he grabbed that same leg with his right arm before it could be pulled away from him. Yanking her up into the air, he was about to slam her into the ground before a streak of flames crashed into him and forced in to let go of Xuelan before he was burnt even worse than he would be if he didn't let go of her.\n\nJumping out of the flames, Naruto nodded to himself in thanks that his clothes had protected most of his body. Of course, he was going to have a pretty nasty burn on his right forearm if he didn't get this treated soon. Naruto narrowed his eyes before he started to run around the flames to see that Xuelan and Ravel weren't... Naruto jumped out of the way as Xuelan fell from the air and crashed into the spot that he had been before he started to run. The ground cracked, and large chunks of earth started to fall from the statue and land in the water down below them.\n\n-One Pawn Belonging to Riser Phenex has been retired-\n\nNaruto heard the anouncement in Grayfia's voice ring through the air, before he took a very quick look down at the Pawns to see that a wooden staff was right next to some of the fallen chunks of rock. That would mean that Mira had been taken out of the game because she had been unlucky enough to have been crushed by a ton of rocks falling from the air.\n\n\"That backfired a bit, but one Pawn should be more than enough to handle a Low-Class Devil, and a newly reincarnated one with no battle experience.\" Ravel commented dryly as she flapped her wings of flame and hovered above the spot where the Pawn on her side had been taken down. She was sure that the Pawn of Rias would easily fall once he was finished running away from the maniac girl running towards him with a flaming chainsaw. It was only a matter of time before Issei faced defeat when all he was able to do at this point was run away. Naruto jumped throught eh air with his fist drawn back at seeing his chance to land a hit on Ravel, and around his pulled back fist a blue lions head made up of his own energy burst into life. As he neared her he made sure to avoid talking so that she wouldn't hear him coming, but sadly that wasn't meant to be when she looked right at him moments later with a smile. \"You yourself aren't in the best spot... see?\" Ravel said as she pointed up into the sky above Naruto's head, and he looked up completely out of instinct.\n\nMistake.\n\nThat very second Naruto felt explosive pain in the side of his skull when Xuelan landed a powerful kick on his head, and he felt the flames around her foot burn the side of his forehead lightly. There was the sound of a powerful boom that came with a Rook landing a hit, before the airborn Naruto was sent flying towards the shore down below. He used his wings to stop himself before he hit the hard ground, and he started to fly back up at them, and flew around a bout of flames erupting from Ravel's hand. She moved her hand so that he was forced to twirl around the flames again, and then once more before he was able to stand upon to stone head again.\n\n\"Okay, first... OW!? That hurt a lot, and second...\" Naruto stated with a look towards the smirking Xuelan for being able to land a hit on him that actually hurt a lot. He as surprised that she actually did have the ability to fight with the strength of a Queen, even if she wasn't as fast her reflexes, durabiltiy, and that flexibility she had for that made up for the lack of speed. He was also able to take notice of the fact that her fighting style revolved around high powered kicks that did a lot of damage quickly, meaning that she was a practitioner of Kung Fu, and she was pretty damn good at it as well.\n\n\"Xuelan, he is about to use a Youjutsu to multiply himself.\" Ravel warned with a smirk on her face just as Naruto clapped his hands together and his body erupted in smoke. Seconds later out of the smoke three Naruto's came out and started to run towards Xuelan, and the real Naruto jumped out of the smoke and started to head towards Ravel with narrowed eyes. There was no way for her to know about one of his secret Youjutsu abilities when not even Rias knew about them, not when he had been keeping that power a secret. She was smirking down at him as he flew up at her, because her knowing this was more than enough to place her even higher on the threat list. \"I know all of your tricks Naruto-kun, just like I know that your Youjutsu Clones only take one hit to defeat, and they don't have your Devil abilities or enhancements.\" Ravel stated with a smile on her face when Naruto flew up and floated in front of her so that they were face to face.\n\n\"Youjutsu: Hairball!\" One of the clones down below stated with a angry tone for some reason as it breathed out a ton of blue mouse shaped fireballs. Xuelan jumped back, before her eyes widened when the blue fireballs shaped like mice exploded into a dozen fireballs each and started to home in on her like homing missiles. She stomped on the ground with narowed eyes and sent a rock into the air, before she kicked it and made it detonate the fireballs before they reached her. The flaming explosion blew her back a few feet, and she was forced to cover her face to protect from the scattering rocks and other depree from the rock exlosion.\n\n\"Youjutsu: Lightning Ball.\" The original Naruto stated as he placed his hands a few inches apart and created a small ball made of concentrated lightning element. Naruto flicked the small lightning ball, and sent it flying towards Ravel's head before she could react. Naruto sighed in annoyance when the technique went through her head and forced her neck to lean back when the small ball went completely through her, only for fire to erupt from the wound and her to be completely healed moments later with no show that she had even fel tthe pain from having her head shot through with lightning.\n\n\"I am an Immortal remember, something like that won't do anything.\" Ravel stated as she just looked at Naruto with a calculating look, and after hearing three puffs of smoke later Xuelan down under them summoned her wings and flew up after them and floated next to Ravel with a nod of understanding for... something that Naruto was unaware of. Naruto looked between Ravel and Xuelan with annoyance, right now he would have to take out Xuelan before he could use the techniques he made to damage the Phenex, and even though they were made to go against Riser, they would work against Ravel as well.\n\n\"Ahahahaha, come back so I can cut you up!\"  \n\"I don't wanna be cut up!\"\n\nThe three in the sky sweat dropped and looked down at the ground to see Issei running away from Nel like his life depended on it, while she continued to chase him around with a chainsaw and cutting up anything in her way to get to him. Naruto started to fly towards Ravel and Xuelan, wanting to go on the offence and not let them have time to build up any power behind their attacks. A lion of energy formed around his fist, while an aura of flame appeared around Xuelan's. She flew towards him as well, and with both fists cocked back their aim struck true moments later when Naruto's fist crashed her cheek, and her fist crashed into his cheek in return.\n\nThe booming sound that followed after was followed by another boom when they both used their legs to kicks each other in the rips and sent them dozens of meters away from each other. Each of them were now sporting angry red mnarks on their faces that would soon become deep bruises, and they were holding their rips in annoyance at the pain they had inflicted on each other. Naruto felt a hand touch his back, before he looked behind himself to see Ravel floating there with a smirk on her face. Naruto's body was engulfed in flames and a scream was heard before Naruto crashed into the ground on top of the head that Ravel started out on, and the ground exploded as rubble started to fall down towards the lake, with a nose almost crushing the two running Pawns down below. Ravel nodded, but kept her eyes trained on the dust cloud slowly vanishing from the spot where the head used to be on the statue.\n\n\"Xuelan, that won't be enough to put him down. Don't drop your guard, from what I have obverved of him he seems to have techniques that can damage those from my family if they hit. The second you see him, rush him with everything you have.\" Ravel ordered with narrowed eyes, but underneath the suspicion you could see some conflict in her eyes. She wanted to marry him, so of course she didn't want to cause him any permanent harm... that was why she would be healing him with Phoenix Tears so that nothing would be left of any scars he might get from this battle.\n\n\"Youjutsu! 5,000 Naruto Barrage!\" Naruto voice came from the sky above them, and both of the girl's were shocked when Ravel sent wind at the cloud of smoke in front of them and cleared it to show that there was not Naruto in the smoke. They both looked up into the sky to see a LOT of clones of Naruto falling down towards them, and by a lot Ravel was sure that after this game the Youjutsu Clone would become an Illegal Move for Rating Games from the unfair numbers advantage it gives Naruto. Seriously, right now there were thousands of Naruto sailing down towards them, seconds away from laying a huge beatdown on them.\n\n\"You won't win with numbers.\" Ravel stated under her breath as she built up her own impressive power and summoned a large fireball above her head nd threw it towards the clones falling towards them. Using her other hand, she sent a stream of wind enhances wind towards the fireball and made it more powerful as it soared through the sky and took out numerous of the clones falling down towards them. Her eyes were staring at her own growing fireball as the screams of the clones wer heard, before the sounds of hundreds of pops were heard.\n\n\"What!?\" Ravel heard Xuelan shout, and turning her head she noticed with wide eyes that the original Naruto had his arm hooked around her neck from behind. She could tell that this was the original because of the bat wings coming from his back as he threw Xuelan towards the ground, before he created a blue firebal in his hand and threw it towards the ground before Ravel could respond and stop it. The explosion that followed sent the Rook falling towards the lake, before a big splash was seen as she landed in the water. No doubt that if they had seen her actual body they would have seen the burns and other damage that she had taken from the pretty powerful attack.\n\n\"Those numbers were only a distraction Ravel, I knew they would never work against you in the air. So I had only created a single clone and threw it into the air with instructions to make as many clones as it could, then I snuck up behind Xuelan.\" Naruto explained to buy himself enough time to begin to build his own energy up for another attack. He could feel Ravel building up her power inside herself as well, knowing that they were both building up power for attacks of a high level made it important that they stall for time so that they could actually charge up.\n\n\"I see, but she wasn't defeated. She is still in the game.\" Ravel pointed out the flaw in his whole plan, while Naruto looked down below to see Xuelan break the surface of the water and gasp at air. He had underestimated just how powerful her durability was, but with only Koneko and Akeno to compare a Rook to he didn't have much of an understanding on just how durable Rooks were when everyone had their durability and strength to different levels. Some Rooks were stronger than others, while others focused more on their defence than strength. Koneko had an equal amount of strength and durability, making her slightly physically weaker than Akeno, who focused on brute strength with a decreased durability. Koneko could take more hits than Akeno, but Akeno could dish out more power than Koneko. He had no idea what the strength to durability ration was for Xuelan, because at best she was like Koneko as the average setting, and at worst she was like Grayfia with both extremely high defence and offence.\n\n\"I focused on her wings, she won't be flying back up to us. That gives us time to battle before she gets here.\" Naruto stated as he landed on the ground again and put his wings up, while Ravel landed nearby, but she kept her wings out for some reason. Naruto looked down out of the conrer of his eye, and nodded in aproval when he saw Issei trying to climb up the side of the cliff so that he could get to what was left of the statue from earlier so that he could promote. Naruto looked to see Ravel forming a fireball in the palm of her hands, before his eyes widened when he saw the color of the fireball change from the usual orange to bright white, showing that the floames heat had far surpassed that of a normal flame.\n\n\"I have been spying on you Naruto-kun, I know all of your tricks. I have trained for years so that I would have counters to everything you could do, and what I can't counter on my own I have plans against involving others. This is my newest move, the Nova Burner. The flames in my hand are so condensed and heated that they devour even other flames.\" Ravel stated with a grin on her face in pride of her own super heated move that she had created to completely bypass the defence enhancements of the Queen. If this move hit, it would burn right through whatever it touched and caterize the the wound for the greatest possible pain. The pain itself should make whoever gets hit pass out if they were hit in a non-fatal spot, while those that were hit fatally would die right away.\n\n\"That explains why you know my moves, but how about this!?\" Naruto asked her with a smirk on his face and he clapped his hands, and the rubble down in the lake exploded into smoke and revealed that Naruto had sent clones down to hide as rubble. His clones quickly went after Nel and the injured Xuelan, and while Xuelan was able to jump out of the way before the clones could attack her with their claws, Nel wasn't as lucky as she was cmauled by the clones in all of her fatal areas.\n\n-One Pawn belonging toe Riser Phenex has been retired-\n\n\"So not all of the clones were destroyed with my fireball... no matter, it was only a Pawn. There only good for promoting, and I don't know what area will let her promote. Not a real loss.\" Ravel stated as she tried to completely her own technique before Naruto noticed that she hadn't finished charging it up. Her Nova Burner was an attack that was literally an instant kill if it hit correctly, and it could hurt her as well just from how much of her demonic power was needed to keep it under control. If she didn't maintain full control of it, then she could very well hurt herself as well. She could already feel the palm of her hand being burnt by her own lack of completely control at this point, something that showed that her move was able to hurt even those of her own clan, despite being based around fire.\n\n\"Pawns can be powerful as well... but you are right, it isn't a real loss for you. With you gone though, this game will be completely in our favor.\" Naruto stated as he clapped his hands together out of instinct and formed one clone right next to him, before he held his right hand out for the clone to take. The clone nodded, before he placed his hands over Naruto's palm and started to pat down at the air in front of hand without thinking about it. Naruto looked at his own hand and he started to see his chakra swirl around his palm and become an amazing swirl of power condensed into a powerful attack of his own. Naruto looked towards Ravel to see her free hand on the wrist of her flame covered hand with a noticable wince seen from even here, her attack was obviously not completed yet.\n\n'This move... it is the same one from my dreams... the Rasengan. Chakra has minor light properties, while her technique is made from demonic powers... I wonder which attack will win.' Naruto thought when his own move completed itself and the clone vanished, before nnaruto studied his own attack and nodded. He wasn't sure why, but as it was the move felt incomplete, like it needed something else added to it.\n\nThe two shared a glance for a brief moment, before they charged each other with their attacks flaring with the need to kill. Ravel was increasing her own speed to match his by sending the flames of her wings out like a rocket's burners making it fly, while Naruto's natural speed was already pretty high. Naruto and Ravel were mere feet from each other, before he lashed out with his foot and kicked her towards the statues. Healing or not, she was still affectected by physical hits, even if she could heal from them. Naruto chased after her with his Rasengan still in his hand, while she started to skin of her feet with her Nova Burner covering her hand. She jumped away from him as he made to hit her with the Rasengan, before she jumped back at him and slashed at him in a chopping fashion with her Nova Burner. He used his elbow to smack her arm away, but the heat of the attack made him wince without even being hit by it.\n\nNaruto kicked at her knee, but with a sickening pop her knee was knocked out of place, before another pop was heard and she healed from the damage. Naruto used the small window to try and hit her with the Rasengan, before she swung her hand nd made him jump back to avoid getting hit by the Nova Burner. Naruto narrowed his eyes, before he created a bubble in his hand, and the next time Ravel tried to attac him with the Nova Burner Naruto used his Flame Bubble to try and absorb the flames of her attack, only for his eyes to widen when the bubble just overloaded with power before it could even absorb her attack. The bubble popped and flames consumed both Ravel and Naruto, with them both jumped out of the flames without much injury on Naruto's part, and no injury at all for Ravel.\n\n'Youjutsu made against flames won't work... that is both wind and fire combined into one, and then condensed. It far surpassed my ability to absorb, and her attack hasn't diminished at all.' Naruto observed with narrowed eyes, his Rasengan still in his hand as he looked at her wincing as she grabbed his wrist and started to charge up mroe energy to keep her Nova Burner from dying out. Naruto's eyes widened when he notice the fact that unlike his ow attack that was self-sustaining, hers needed her to constantly fuel it with her own power.\n\nThen, without any signal the two of them ran towards each other again, only this time they made no attempts to try and attack each other with anything other than their chosen attacks. Naruto and Ravel stared at each other in the eyes when his grinding power met against her burning force. Nartuto and Ravel were forced to resort to a battle of wills when her white flames spouted and started to melt the ground around them with every spout of flames that touched the earth, while energy flowed around Naruto and powered up the grinding destruction of his Rasengan. The light power of chakra was the only thing helping him keep his ground against the Nova Burner's burning power and piercing ability.\n\nThe ground under their feet started to crack as their power output started to increase to levels that were far surpassing that of their respective King's ability to produce with a single attack. The waves of their energy suraged outwards in a spehere made of light and demonic power of his Chakra and her Magic, and the ground was completely broken up s that they were now simply floating in a sphere of fire and chakra, trying their hardest to attack and defeat the one they were staring down without blinking. Naruto raised his other hand towards Ravel and summoned a blue bubble that was filling itself up with water, while Ravel used her other hand to wind a blast of wind towards the bubble and pop it so that the water inside coated both of them, before it evaporated from Ravel from the heat her body was creating.\n\n-One Pawn and One Rook belonging to Rias Gremory and Riser Phenex respectivally have been retire-\n\nNaruto winced when he heard that it would seem that Issei and Xuelan had been caught in the waves of energy and fire from his and Ravel's attacks fightin each other. His wince was all it took for Ravel to use her free hand to grab his wrist, and using her Phenex healing she forced his hand towards her face so that the Rasengan was grinding against her flesh instead of her attack. Her own attack flashed towards Naruto as the flames erupting from Ravel's head healed her on the damage made by his Rasengan. Slapping her forearm away from him, her flame covered hand was diverted and the two of them were forced to seperate him each other as their attacks did nothing to the opposite one. Ravel had already healed from his attack, and her attack had never landed in the first place.\n\n'She can use her flames to increase her speed to that of the Queen... and her natural reserves and magical ability are being enhanced by the Bishop. With her talent, power, and brains this is going to be a hard battle.' Naruto thought to himself as he studied a lightly panting Ravel, who looked like she had seen better days with how her skin was a little paler than it was before. The light properties of the chakra were affecting her, even if her body healed from the attack. Clapping his hands together, three clones appeared and all of them seperated so that they were rushing at Ravel from different angles. She looked around herself, before she blocked a punch frpom one and jumped out of the way from the kick of another one. She was slugged in the face by the third, but she shrugged it off and sent a bout of flames at the one that slugged her. The clone that slugged her jumped away from the flames, before Ravel jumped into the sky and floated there before setting all three clones on fire and popping them.\n\n\"Clones won't work on me Naruto-kun.\" Ravel stated as she looked down to see Naruto three inches from her face with wide eyes, before she was hit with whyat was most likely the most painful thing she had ever felt in her life. She was sent flying towards the stone statue that was still standing... and standing it was no longer as her body made a crater near the bottom and the entire thing fell over into the lake, and caused massive waves to crash into her and sent her flying into the wall of the cliff.\n\nNaruto went sailing through the air after her, before he landed on the sore in front of her to see her on the ground pucking up some blood before she stood up and winced when she felt his power being enhanced... by something.\n\n\"The clones were just a distraction... I am surprised you can still stand after having your lifeforce hit with Senjutsu like that.\" Naruto stated, and for the first time Ravel noticed that changes that could be seen on Naruto's body. The very first thing was the brightly glowing Sun and Infinity symbol on his right palm, and the second thing she noticed was the fact that Naruot seemed to have a red circle marking on his head, with another dot inside that circle. Both things quickly faded away when Naruto felt his Senjutsu energy fade away, and a small case of physical exhaustion hit him.\n\n\"Ha... ha... you are pretty good. I feel like my insides are on fire, and that I will pass out any second now. Senjutsu... is something to be feared indeed. One hit and I was almost defeated by it...\" Ravel said through pants as blood leaked from her mouth, something that wasn't done most of the time with her families amazing ability to heal from most any damage to their bodies. She now knew why her father and brothers considered the Nekoshou to be both respected and something to be feared. This Senjutsu could kill even them if they were hit with a good enough amount of it, and she was almost a goner from just one hit.\n\n\"You did good Ravel-chan, but just because you know my moves, doesn't mean that they won't work on you... Nekoshou's Evil Eye!\" Naruto chanted out the name of his mind attack, and his eyes turned bright blue as he invaded Ravel's mind... only for him to stumble back moments later and rub his eyes in irritation when his ribs throbbed painfully from the earlier damage he had taken from Xuelan. The pain in his ribs cancelling his attack right away, and with his eyes yellow again he walked over to the panting Ravel while wincing with each step. He wasn't going to admit it, but the hits he had take during this fight were pretty bad.\n\n\"If you beat me... you have to marry me.\" Ravel pointed out neutrally as he got nearer to her, and he nodded slightly before he used his chakra to coat his fist in another lion shaped chakra aura. Slamming his fist into her face, she crashed into the ground as the light properties of chakra made the attack stick, even if she would heal from it the attack was still more than enough to cuase her the right amount of head trama to knock her out cold.\n\n\"I know.\" Naruto stated as her body started to glow blue, and she vanished into dust.\n\n-One Bishop belonging to Riser Phenex has retired, Winner of ths Rating Game is Rias Gremory-\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**That wasn't Naruto's full power as in RAW power, but all his raw power moves were useless against Ravel so he only used the moves he was sure would affect her.**_  \n_**Next to Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t38. Chapter 38 Boosted Twilight\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n_Girl_\n\n\"Eh!?\" Asia shouted when an unexplained voice came to her mind from seemingly nowhere at all, and frankly she was creeped out by the fact that she was hearing voices when she was home alone today. You see, she had opted not to do anything today for a very simple reason. It had been a few days after the Rating Game that Rias had officially won because of Naruto. A few days since Naruto had needed more healing than she had ever seen him need, because the broken bones in his body and third degree burns on his arms were something that couldn't be ignored. She had spend a few hours with Rias healing Naruto of his wounds, something that had tired her out while Rias went to work on Issei and his concussion from having his head slammed into the ground.\n\nAnyway, today she just didn't feel like doing anything at all because she wasn't in the mood. You see, today was the day that she had been dreading for the last week or so since she had been marked as Naruto's girlfriend, mate, and future lover when she was ready for the next step in their relationship. A day that she had been hoping would never come, even if she knew that it was going to happen no matter what she did.\n\nToday Naruto was getting married to Ravel, binding the Gremory and Phenex together in an iron clad pact.\n\nA pact that didn't affect her in the slightest, being a human she couldn't really see why the two families needed a marraige for an agreement to be made between them. She didn't want Naruto to get married to somebody else before he married her, because just as she was his... he was hers as well. He had pretty much told her that much himself, but in slightly different words. She could see herself allowing him to have a harem, but she had no idea who this Ravel girl was or anything about her. Frankly, she would rather he be with somebody that she approved of. It may sound possessive of her, but she wanted to have as much of his time as she could get while she was still young... she was a human, and he wasn't. There lifespans were vastly different, so unless she could gain a similar lifespan as him then he was going to have to live through her death. That was why she agreed with a harem so readily, but she didn't know this Ravel girl.\n\nThe only devil that she could see herself willingly turn into a devil for was Naruto, but he wasn't able to turn her yet. That was why she had been hoping that by some miracle that she would be able to gain the same lifespan as him... without needing to be turned into a devil.\n\n_Girl... find me._\n\n\"Whose there!?\" Asia shouted in a slight amount of fear when she heard the sound of a deep male voice speaking to her from who knows where. It was really starting to creep her out to here a voice coming from nowhere, and she was seconds away from running out of the house in fear.\n\n_Power... I can give you strength... I can give you 'Naruto-kun' back._\n\n\"... Can you stop the wedding?\" Asia asked to the air in the hopes that this person could help her gain the power she would need to have in order to do... something... anything to stop this wedding from happening. She walked around the room in the hopes that the voice would respond, and instead of a blank silence it seemed that the voice was thinking about the answer.\n\n_Yes... you have the Twilight Healing... with my power... you can stop this wedding. Find. Me._\n\nAsia nodded to herself as she started to look for where the voice was coming from, because lets face it, if this was in Naruto's home then it most likely wasn't something that was going to cause her any harm. Naruto wasn't the kind of person that would keep something super dangerous in his home where she could get hurt without knowing about it, at least if he had something he would tell her about it or give her a warning. She started by looking in the kitchen to try and find the voice inside the cabinets, or even under the table. She looked everywher eshe could think to find, and she decided to pass the time by trying and talking to the voice.\n\n\"So... what is your name mister?\" Asia asked with a slight tilt to her head as she opened the fridge... yes, she was looking for the voice in the fridge.\n\n_I am known as Ddraig... I am the Heavenly Dragon sealed inside the Boosted Gear._\n\n\"Well Ddraig-san, why are you here?\" Asia asked in wonder as she moved around towards the bedroom to try and find him, only to slowly close the door when she realized that she was in Koneko's room, a place that she was told not to go in if she valued her life. Koneko had threatened her with that herself if she was ever caught going into her room.\n\n_I was extracted from my previous owner Issei Hyoudou... he brought great shame to me by losing me like that. The one known as Naruto was the one I wanted as my new weilder, but he never put me on._\n\nAsia couldn't help but feel a little sorry that Ddraig was extracted from Issei, and had been without somebody to weild him this entire time, but she was also glad that nobody that gotten him before now. That would mean that now she had the chance to get strong enough to protect Naruto for once, protect him from something that he didn't want to happen to him. She was going to be honest and say that she didn't want to fight anyone, but if she needed to get into a battle for Naruto then she would do it. If this Ddraig could help her, then she would gladly do anything to save her first real friend from a fate that she wouldn't wish on anyone, a thing that no girl would wish on anyone... a loveless marraige.\n\nHer Sacred Gear wasn't something that she could use in battle to actually fight, so that was why she was going to see if this one could help her. She wanted to help Naruto, even if it went against everything she stood as a pacifist she would do what it took to make sure that Naruto didn't have to marry somebody that he didn't want to marry.\n\n\"Please Lord, give me the strength for the trials ahead of me, and forgive me for going against the Bible and loving a demon.\" Asia prayed silently with her hands on the silver cross necklass she always wore on her body. She continued to look for the voice named Ddraig, but no matter where she looked she could think of where a Sacred Gear would be hidden. Asia sat down on the couch and placed her hands on her chin and tilted her head with her eyes squinted, trying to think like Naruto for a few moments she tried to imagine where he would hide something that he didn't want found.\n\n_Hurry up and find me, I don't want to collect dust under here._\n\n'Under here?' Asia thought to herself as she started to think of the places that you could hide something under instead of inside. A place that most people wouldn't think to look for a Sacred Gear, a place that only somebody like Naruto would think to look for something ancient and powerful. Asia started to sweat drop when she got off the couch, before she got down on all fours with her butt sticking in the air in a way that was revealing her snow white panties to the world. She was shaking her butt with her tongue sticking out as she reached under the couch to see if she could find anything, before she blinked when her finger bumped into something hard. She grabbed it and started to pull it out from under the couch with a small amount of effort when it got caught on something, so pulling as hard as she could she yanked the object from under the couch and landed on her side while the object landed on the floor nearby.\n\nShe started to get up, before she went right back down when she bumped her head painfully against the coffee table. With teary eyes she made sure to avoid the coffee table when she stood up and went over to the red scale gauntlet on the floor with the glowing green gem. She picked it up, and the symbol of a dragons head appeared in the green gem.\n\n_Good, you found me... and you have a Dragon Affinity... you are good enough to become my next wielder._\n\n\"You promise to help me stop Ravel-san from marrying Naruto-kun?\" Asia asked with a pouty frown on her face, because Naruto had told her to always read the fine print before agreeing to anything that had unnown issues.\n\n_Heh, of course, but if you are going to use me... then I will not be taken off again. I will become just as much apart of your soul as the Twilight Healing you possess is... the question is, what are you willing to sacrifice to save your friend?_\n\n\"Anything.\" Asia answered without hesitating. She had waited so long in her life to have a real friend that treated her just like he would treat anyone, and then that friend became her boyfriend, quite a few stages higher than a normal friend. Not only that, but he was somebody that she could truly say was her best friend. He would sacrifice everything for his friends, but nobody seemed willing to do the same for him when it came down to it. Nobody was going against the marraige, even though they all knew that he didn't want to do it. The only reason he was doing it was because of his sense of honor, something that was strong and firm in it's making. Her Naruto wouldn't back down from a challenge, even if he had to lose his arms and legs he would protect or do what he believed to be right and he would do it with pride.\n\nYet, even the strongest of pillars could be knocked down. Naruto needed another pillar of strength that wasn't his own to support him and keep him from falling, and she would be that pillar. The others weren't helping him in his time of need, the one true time that he needed everyone else around him for support, and he wasn't getting it.\n\n_You are sure, even if the price of the bonding is an arm? You would be fine with me taking and arm from you?_\n\n\"... Yes, take my arm, my leg, or my eyes. I will pay any price if it means that Naruto doesn't have to marry somebody he doesn't want to.\" Asia said with an amazing amount of clarity in her voice for somebody so young and inexperienced in this type of matter. Ddrain was silent for awhile, and for a moment Asia was thinking that he was going to tell her that he changed his mind, before the sound of him huffing was heard by her.\n\n_Then place me on your left arm... Partner._\n\n\"Alright!\" Asia said as she did as was commanded of her and she slipped the large gauntlet onto her body with a wince when she felt a slight burning sensation appear in that very same arm. She groaned when the burning got even worse than before, but she would endure this pain. She would endure it because she had to endure it, and because she wanted to endure it. She fell to her knees and tears started to leak out of her eyes when the burning got even worse than before when the gauntlet started to shrink down to fit her size, and then she could feel the amazing power bursting inside the gauntlet even without it fully melded with her body and soul just yet. She had to bite her lip to avoid screaming and waking up the elderly couple next door when the pain got even worse than before, and she could feel the sensation of her arm becoming one with the gauntlet.\n\nShe looked down at her arm, and saw that the gauntlet was shrinking down even more and becoming slightly tighter to her skin than it had been when she had taken it out from under the couch. She wondered what was going on with her arm, but moments later the green gem glowed even more brightly as a silver ring appeared on one of the clawed fingers on her new left arm. She blinked when the pain stopped and she was givenb a new look at her arm. She sighed in relief when she noticed that it wasn't covering her entire arm. The gauntlet was only covering her hand and forearm up to her elbow, while not touching her elbow either. She saw that the spikes on the sides of the gauntlet had changed slightly, becoming shorter and more rouched than they had been before, seeming to take her non-violent personality into it's new shape.\n\nLooking at the ring finger, she saw the her own Twilight Healing was connected to the glove part of the new arm. The ring seemed to have melded with her arm in a way that she wouldn't be able to take it off or de-summon the ring like she normally could. Raising up her human arm, she summoned the other half of the Twilight Healing with a gentle sigh at how she could still use both rings. She waved her new arm around, and was thankful that it wasn't heavy in the slightest... in fact, the gauntlet on her arm seemed to be slimmer than when she put it on, instead of just smaller it was like the entire thing had fused with an aspect of her and become a bit more feminine as well since she didn't have the normal physical strength to hold up a heavy gauntlet like that for long.\n\nShe smiled lightly and placed the gauntlet above her head and looked at it through the moonlight shining through the window.\n\nShe was Asia Argento, the girl that possessed both the Twilight Healing and the Boosted Gear, a faithful member of the Church, a human, and most of all she was the girlfriend of Naruto.\n\nShe had a boyfriend to save.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t39. Chapter 39 The Start of the Wedding\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto frowned when he looked at his image reflected at him in the mirror of the room that he had been given to change into his formal attire for the wedding, and frankly he wasn't happy one bit. The only reason Naruto was so accepting of the idea was because he didn't want Rias to get married to a jerk like Riser and become breeding stock for the devil population. He honored the request because of the fact he owed the Gremory, but his main reason for importance was because he wanted to help his friends. If Rias got married to Riser, then not only would Rias live a hellish life, but so would her entire peerage... even more so the females. When two High-Class Devils were joined in marraige they gained control of each others peerage members as well, meaning that a pervert like Riser would have control of the girls in Rias' peerage. Rias wasn't the only one that was at stake from a marraige between herself and Riser, but also Akeno and Koneko.\n\nHis own sister.\n\nHe wasn't about to let scum like Riser get his hands on his big sister, not when him getting married could prevent it. He wanted to protect his friends, and it wasn't like Ravel was that bad of a girl... very arrogant, but she was of noble blood so that arrogance was almost promised of her. Naruto was sure that his marraige didn't have to be loveless, not when Ravel wasn't as powerful as him, meaning that if he didn't want to do something sexual with her, then she couldn't make him do it. That was the advantage that he had over Rias, if she was with Riser then he could make her do what she didn't want to do because he was stronger than she was. Ravel could attempt to make him do something, but then she would bet getting a Senjutsu enhanced punch to the face for trying to rape him.\n\nMost of all... why the hell white?\n\nNaruto looked at the suit he was being forced to wear, and his most blaring concern about it was the fact that it was the color white. Sure, his hair was white, but that was his hair. He could trasnform his hair into any shape of color he wanted, but he just didn't want to. Wearing a white tuxedo was something that was so amazingly cliche these days that it didn't scream 'Naruto' in how creative it was. Now if it were orange, then he would completely be excited to wear something so awesome. Seriously, was it that hard to make a suit that didn't make him give off the aura of a total... noble. He hated when people gave him respect that he hadn't earned, and everyone was going to be kissing his ass because he was marrying into the Phenex family. He would prefer to... whose hand was touching his butt?\n\nNaruto turned his head with a raised eyrebrow, before he started to sweat drop when he saw Akeno doing... something to his backside. He couldn't tell if she was dusting the cloth off, or she was trying to molest him. Smacking her hand away from his rear, he gave her a twitching eye and that was all that was needed for her to back away a bit with a smile on her face.\n\n\"Ara ara, no harm done. You just looked so delicious in your little suit that I wanted to make sure _everything_ was perfect.\" Akeno commented with a sadistic lick of her lip, and even in her expensive dress Naruto couldn't help but sigh in relief that at least ONE person wasn't treating him with pity from his group. Akeno was doing the same thing she would do everyday, tease the hell out of him and/or molest him when her teasing didn't work in the hopes that he would blush from the touching. Sometime she would get him to blush, and sometimes he wouldn't blush or hold back the blush and tell her off... but right now he was finding comfort in the fact that she wasn't treating him like a pity case.\n\n\"Everything is perfect, it always is. You should know that from all the times you jumped in on me in the shower... in that disgusting Pedobear suit.\" Naruto said the last part with a noticable shiver in his back from the horrible memories of where his justified fear came from. He was an attractive Shota, just being alive was like being Pedobear bait. He really hated the day that Akeno had decided that teasing him in a Pedobear constume would be fun, and he was glad that she hadn't done it in a long time... herself that is. He was surprised when she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and with a small grin on her face and breathed into his ear, before she lightly placed her lips on the top of his ear. She had to bend over to do this, so she regret the fact that she couldn't also smoosh her breasts into his back, but this was enough for the moment.\n\n\"You know... I have always wanted to tempt a man into having an affair. What do you say, want to cheat on your fiance? Maybe even think of me when you are having sex with her?\" Akeno teased lightly as one of her hands started to slowly go down his chest. Her finger rubbed circles across his stomach when she got to that point, before he felt like jumping when her hand just dropped until she had her hand on top of his crotch... outside of the pants of course. Naruto crossed his arms and tilted his head to send Akeno a look that told her one thing 'I am not amused', and even though she got the look she still kept her hand on his crotch and started to rub a little. \"... Wow, even after my teasing you aren't getting hard. You sure are getting hard to tease.\" Akeno stated as she let go of him and seperated herself from his body, while Naruto smiled lightly and turned around to face her.\n\n\"Of course I am getting harder to tease, I know all your tricks Akeno.\" Naruto claimed with a smirk, something that brought a smirk to Akeno's face as well as she placed a hand on her cheek and gazed at him for a few seconds... before she sighed as well in a mocking way.\n\n\"Pity, and I still remember when I make you blush that cute little red, while covering your crotch from embarrassment. I guess I will have to step up my game, or I won't be able to have that affair I want.\" Akeno said with a playful, and slightly serious, tone that indicated that she would indeed be trying harder to tease Naruto into blushing. Naruto's smile twitched for a few moments, before he sighed and his smile seemed to change into a more genuine one.\n\n\"Thanks Akeno, everyone else is giving me nothing but pity. It feels nice to have somebody treat me the same as always. I'm not even mad at you for teasing me right now.\" Naruto thanked her truthfully, and from the bottom of his heart. Akeno smiled when she heard the words that she was pretty sure she would never hear again. Somebody was thanking her for her teasing, so she would savour this for later enjoyment. Of course, the main reason she was teasing Naruto was because she had noticed that the others that knew him were giving him pity, something Naruto hated. He was the kind of person that would spit your pity right back in your face, and then try and earn your respect by kicking your ass and changing your opinion of him. She figured that he needed somebody to just treat him no differently than they always did, so she would just continue to tease him whenever she felt that he needed it... or when she wanted to try and make him blush. She still wanted her favorite little white haired neko to become a blushing mess at her hands, because he was always her favorite target when she needed to tease or bully somebody as a younger teen.\n\n\"Good to know, and I would never pity you. You would just spit in my face if I did.\" Akeno commented dryly, and together they both shared a small laugh even if the current situation wasn't something they should be laughing during. They both stopped laughing when the door opened and the rest of the club came into the room, and Naruto had to sweat drop when he saw that Gasper was wearing a dress instead of a suit like Naruto, Issei, and Yuuto were. You could even tell everyone's personality by the way they were dressed. Rias was wearing an elegant dress that seemed to match the white theme of the party, while Issei was wearing a black tux that he couldn't be bothered in wearing the correct way. Yuuto wore his white tuxedo with a prim and proper look to it, while Gasper wore a small purple dress that only came up to the middle of his thighs... boy were men going to feel like throwing up if they tried to peek up that dress. Blaze was wearing a suit, but he had a few bulged in his jacket, showing that underneath of it he was carrying weapons... being in a room filled with devils that aren't fond of Low-Class Devils must be setting his nerves on fire. Kalawarner was wearing a copy of what Akeno was wearing, while Murayama and Katase had on matching green dressed.\n\nThen there was his sister, and like himself her clothes were white. A small dress that was pure white, and went down to her knees with a small slit up the side that went to her upper thighs. The dress was shoulderless, but like always she had her little cat head hairpin in her hair. She seemed to have a small aura of depression around her.\n\n\"You look... good Otouto.\" Koneko said awkwardly after a few moment of the two of them staring at each other.\n\n\"You too Onee-chan.\" Naruto said just as awkwardly, this most likely wasn't the scenerio they imagined that they would be weairng clothes like this, so they were both feeling a little awkward. Rias was lookingt at Naruto with a sad expression, but honestly, she couldn't even form the words to thank him for what he was doing. It was breaking her heart to see him doing this for them, and expecting nothing in return. No matter how she phrased it in her head, no amount of thanks could ever get her to the level of just how thankful she was for everything that Naruto did for her. Here he was, taking the ultimate bullet for her, and she couldn't even tell him that she was sorry that he had to do this for her, or that she was thankful that he was her Queen. She had tried to tell him thank you, and that she would try to free him from this many times now, but whenever she attempted to put it into words... nothing came out. She just couldn't look him in the face and say 'thank you'. He had earned far more than a simple thank you from her, and she knew it. That was why she had such trouble telling that to him, because he deserved better than words. He needed actions instead.\n\n\"This is depressing, you are all depressing me.\" Blaze commented roughly, before he was smacked in the sside of the head by Kalawarner. Naruto was expecting Blaze to shot her in the face then and there, but to his surprise Blaze just nodded to her and shut up before he made a mess of things.\n\n'Hmm? Is there something between them?' Naruto thought in idle curiousity. He had noticed that Blaze and Kalawarner seemed to have gotten pretty close after their death match awhile back, and they were both war loving fighters so they had a bit in common as well. Eiether way, if the two of them wanted to be in some kind of relationship then that was up to them and nobdoy else.\n\n\"We aren't here to entertain you... so how are you... that is a scary look.\" Yuuto commented with a sweat drop when he saw the look on Naruto's face. He should have known that this wasn't the first time today that somebody had asked that very same question. In all honesty, it was the very first question that came to his mind when he saw Naruto. It wasn't everyday your best friend takes a major blow to his future for his friends, so he wasn't sure how he was suppose to take it.\n\n\"Don't worry Naruto, we have this kickass plan to get you out of the marraige!\" Issei assured with a grin on his face, while Naruto looked towards Koneko with a raised eyebrow. She looked at the blushing Rias with a knowing look, meaning that it was Rias that was suppose to tell Naruto that they had a plan.\n\n\"Buchou tried to hire somebody to kidnap you before the kiss and hide you away long enough to find a loophole in the contract.\" Koneko answered the unasked question, while Naruto's head shot towards Rias with a surprised face. She was blushing a little at how her plan had been revealed before she had the chance to explain it to Naruto herself, but now that her plan was out in the open she couldn't help but sigh and nod as she admit to the fact she had hired somebody to attempt to kidnap Naruto during the wedding.\n\n\"Okay, what idiot would agree to try and kidnap... you hired Onee-sama didn't you?\" Naruto asked in a deadpan tone, knwoing that one of the few people that would be stupid enough to even attempt such a thing during the marraige of a member of a High-Class family like the Phenex and the only male Nekoshou. There were already rumors about how Naruto and Ravel were going to be the next power couple of the underworld, with his brute force and her brains and natural talent they were labled as the couple that would exceed Sirzechs and Grayfia as the power couple. There was so much security around this wedding that only those that had an invitation and access to either the Phenex or Gremory teleportation circle could get in without having a total strip check and cavity search. There were dozens of High-Class Devil guards standing around the area with weapons ready, not only that but it was safe to say that even if they did get inside they would have to face multiple members of the Phenex and Gremory families that actually want this wedding, not to mention the other Pillar Family members that came and want the union to go off without a hitch.\n\n\"The less you know, the better.\" Katase answered for Rias, who was sweating lightly in an attempt to not tell Naruto just who she hired to try and kidnap him.\n\n\"I... honestly don't even want to know.\" Naruto stated with an annoyed tone. Rias was starting to sweat even more and her lips puckered slightly when she saw that Naruto had figured out right away who she had hired to try and kidnap him... even though Kuroka had been busy she had to go with a different person, but the fact that he had figured out her first choice and thought it was stupid was enough to tell her that maybe her plan to stall for time wasn't as good as she had thought it would be. She shook her head for a moment to clear her mind of her own plan, knowing that Naruto was pretty good at reading what she was thinking by the expression on her face.\n\nThe entire group heard the sound of the door opening, and they turned to see somebody standing in the door with a smirk on his face as he walked towards the group.\n\n\"So... you are my little sisters chosen husband... she could have done worse.\" The mystery man stated, revealing that he was one of the three older brothers of Ravel. He seemed to be in his later twenties, and like his siblings he had the same blonde hair and dark blue eyes. Unlike the others though, he was wearing clothes that seemed to fit his position as a noble. Not only that, but the presence of his power was more than enough to make the others back away from this man out of pure instinct and even stop talking with a small amount of sweat on their brows. The only one seemingly immune to this aura of power was Naruto as he stared at the man with a raised eyebrow and a small tilt of his head.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Naruto asked the big question, before the man smiled and extended his hand towards Naruto with a friendly aura about him that didn't seem to fit with his family's reputation.\n\n\"Ruval Phenex, the next Lord Phenex. Ravel has talked a lot about you over the last few years Naruto, and seeing you in person... I have to say I approve of her choice.\" Ruval stated as he and Naruto shook hands in a show that neither had any issues with the other one. Ruval then pulled Naruto a bit closer and placed his other hand under Naruto's chin and started looking closely at his face with a curious look in his eyes. Naruto's eye twitched a few times, but since there was nothing bad happening yet he just allowed the inspection of his head to continue. Ruval seemed to have a curious look on his face for a few moment, as if he was judging something about Naruto, before he smiled again. \"Yes, you will do just well for her. You have a strong jaw, and gentle eyes. You are a strong person, but you have much compassion for others... you put others before yourself, and will endure pain for those that accept you as you are... you will make a great brother. If only you had blond hair and blue eyes, then you would be a dead ringer for a natural born Phenex... with the expection of those whisker marks.\" Ruval stated as he backed away a few steps now that he was done taking a look at who his sister had picked to marry.\n\n\"You aren't like your siblings.\" Naruto commented, before he noticed Ruval nod as he turned around and started to walk towards the door.\n\n\"I am not my siblings, just like they are not me. We are our own people with our own goals and personalities, so saying we are all alike is pointless. There is good and bad in all of us Naruto, but some of us have more of one and less of the other. You seem like a good kid, so I am leaving Ravel in your capable hands... you did defeat a Phenex after all. That has to say something, you earned my respect young Nekoshou.\" Ruval stated as he got to the door, before he turned his head and looked at Naruto with a slight smirk. \"Of course, the real reason I came here was to tell you that the wedding is about to start, and Lord Lucifer seems to have something planned... you wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?\" Ruval asked in a hinting way, while Naruto saw Rias blink at the fact that her brother seemed to also have something planned.\n\n\"Sirzechs' plans confuse me, so I can't say I know what is going on... you seem to know a lot about what is going to happen.\" Naruto stated right back to the older male, who just started to close the door as he made his exit.\n\n\"Birds and Cats are rivals, just like Tigers and Dragons... since Tigers are cats... I was wondering about how a dragon would react to seeing their rival get stolen... it would be an interesting fight to see. The Phoenix fighting the Dragon over the right to have the White Tiger, their rival, as their lover.\" Ruval said as he finally left the room and allowed them to ponder what he had just stated.\n\nCats and Birds, Tigers and Dragons... what the hell?\n\n\"I am more confused than ever.\" Issei stated as he held the side of his head in confusion, the others not far behind his example seeing as the words confused most of them as well.\n\nA Dragon fighting a Phoenix over a Tiger.\n\nNaruto started to ponder those words, before he looked at the clock and saw that the wedding was just fixing to start for real. The others quickly left the room, while Koneko stayed with her brother and linked her arm with his. As his only at hand family member, and close relative it was her job to walk him down the carpet. She and Naruto walked out of the room, and the first thing they saw were rows and rows of guests waiting for them to walk towards the alter.\n\nThe wedding... had begun.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t40. Chapter 40 Holy Infinity\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nNaruto wished that he could sigh for what was the fifth time since the wedding started, and so far he was bored out of his mind. Ravel stood in front of him with a radiant smile on her face, and a white dress that was matching his tuxedo. The frills at the edges of her dress screamed Ravel to him, and he would readily admit that Ravel looked amazing in her dress, but frankly he just wanted this entire thing over as soon as possible. He could tell that today was the day that was making Ravel the happiest in her life, but he could also tell anyone that asked that this was the worst day of his life... and that was counting the time that a dog had bitten his tail.\n\n\"If any wish to speak out against the union of Naruto Toujou and Ravel Phenex in this binding contract, speak now or forever hold your piece.\" The officiater of the wedding stated loudly to the entire room, and frankly Naruto didn't expect anyone at all to say anything against the wedding. He sent a look towards his friends, and he could plainly see Rias biting her thumb and looking around for the person that was suppose to kidnap Naruto and buy them time to make a plan to get him out of the contract. The only other person that looked like they wanted... holy... Sirzechs looked like somebody had kicked him in the nuts. The man was flat out crying silently with tears running down his face at the beautiful scene in front of him, even if he didn't want Naruto and Ravel to get married, the scene itself was adorable. Naruto in his white suit, and Ravel in her white dress standing together with thei pinkies tied together with a red string, the red string of fate that connected two lovers... this was a devil ceremony, so they made it a point to avoid anything holy for the entire wedding.\n\n\"I, have an objection.\" A neutral voice rang out through the entire room, a feminine neutral voice that seemed to be the pot that all emotion went to die in. Every devils eyes went to the doors of the of the room, and many people raised eyebrows when they saw a group of people walking into the room.\n\nThe first person standing at the front of the group was a small girl with hair as black as night, and eyes as cold as a gray sky. Her pale skin shined in the lighting, and her black clothing that didn't cover much made her stand out even more at the mostly white wedding.\n\n\"Man, this place is filled to the brim.\" The second person standing a few feet behind the girl stated in a deeper, but playful voice as he held a long rod over his shoulder like he didn't even have a care in the world. He wore ancient chinese armor over his body, and his skin was darker than the first persons. He kept his hair short so that it would stay out of his eyes, and he gave off a very battle lusting aura around him.\n\n\"Nyahahaha, as expected. This is MY Otouto's wedding Bikou-kun!\" The third person, somebody that many devils were familiar with by the wanted posters of her circulating all over the Underworld years ago for a mixed amount of crimes that included murder, thieft, and many other counts of the before mentioned crimes against devils as a species... which mysteriously stopped a few years ago. This woman was none other than Kuroka the Black Cat, the elder sister of Naruto and Koneko.\n\n\"So this is your brother... he gives off an aura of power.\" The fourth person in the group stated, and everyones eyes went to this person in silence, already shocked that Kuroka the Black Cat was standing among them and rejecting them wedding. This person was a youthful young blond man with glasses covering his eyes, and instead of the more crazy attire like the rest of the group he was wearing a business style suit. He also gave off a similar aura of power as the others in the group, and Yuuto almost attacked this man off instinct when he noticed that in this man's hands were none other than the Holy Sword that ruled over other beings... Excalibur Ruler, the lost fragmant of the broken Holy Sword Excalibur, one of the four greatest Holy Swords ever created by God.\n\n\"He's cute too, don't you think so Onii-sama?\" The fifth person in the group, seemingly related to the fourth person based on her looks. This person was a young girl that looked to be in possibly in middle school, maybe a little older than that. She had hair just as blonde as Ravel's hair, and her eyes were a playful blue color. Her skin was just as fair as many people have ever seen, and she wore a large blue witches with a black bow and yellow stars, a sorceress-like dress, an finally a matching blue cape with pink flowers on the outside and a white color on the inside that was draped over her shoulders. She didn't have an amazing aura of power about her like the others, but she seemed to be a girl that wouldn't stop smiling.\n\n\"Le Fay, I am a male. I have no sexual interest in another male, but he is rather cute from the stand point of a neutral watcher.\" The fourth person stated as he pushed his glassed up his nose neutrally, and the gril pouted for a moment before she waved over to Naruto with an excited look in her eyes. He waved back rather awkwardly, having no idea who this girl was. Though, she seemed to be named Le Fey if what her brother said was correct.\n\n\"Arthur, I didn't know you were gay... oh god you're gay. I can never undress in front of you again.\" Bikou teased the now named Arthur with a grin on his face as he started to laugh out loud at his own joke, while Arthur just ignored him and started to scan the room for any possible threats. It would seem that the power they were all giving off was scaring most of the devils into a state on non-violence for the moment.\n\n\"Sorry I am late Otouto, but I was getting a little help nya. Ophis-sama was more than willing to help me when I told her that the one needing to be rescued was you nya.\" Kuroka stated as she started to run towards her younger sibling, while those she passed by started to shake in fear when they heard the name Ophis applied to the one leading the group. Everyone that knew about Ophis looked like they wanted to escape as soon as possible, while Rias was looking at Kuroka in nothing but pure shock.\n\nTalk about friends in high places, you didn't get higher than asking the Dragon-God to come and help you break up a wedding ceremony. If she had known that Kuroka was going to get a God involved in all of this, then she wouldn't be nearly as worried as she was... then she remembered that she was in the same room as the most powerful being in existance to her knowledge and started to shake lightly from fear like many of the others.\n\n'So that was her mission, she was spying on this group.' Naruto thought as she came right up to him with a teasing grin on her face, while Ravel looked a LOT paler than she had been before when she saw not only the Black Cat, but also the Dragon-God. She had no idea that her sweet Naruto-kun was related to the infamous Black Cat, and before now she had only though that the two's only connection was the fact that they shared the same race. Sharing a race didn't mean being automatically related, not when she had black hair and he had white hair. They didn somewhat look aline with their cheek structure and how they were both kind of short, with Kuroka standing at 5 feet 3 inches. Not as short as her siblings, but not tall either.\n\n\"Riser-sama fainted!?\" The yell of one of the members of Riser's peerage shouted out in horror, while Naruto snorted lightly at the fact that Riser fainted over the simple fact that some Dragon-God was in the same room as they were... with a group of people putting out enough power to wipe out almost everyone in the room with a few expections. Even the officiater looked like he was about to faint, which made him not very good at his job if he was going to faint for such a lame reason.\n\n\"I, have brought a challenger.\" Ophis stated as a fact as she looked at Bikou and Arthur, both of which nodded and moved out of the way to show the final person in the group at this moment. Naruto blinked in shock for a few moments, before he himself felt a bit faint when he saw just who this challenger was. Standing there in all of her blonde cuteness was none other than his very own girlfriend... Asia Argento. Naruto blinked a few more times when he noticed something that shouldn't be possible, because his mind must be playing tricks on him at this moment because on Asia's left arm was none other than the Boosted Gear that he had put under the couch so that he could decide what he wanted to do with it later when he felt like not being lazy.\n\n\"Naruto-kun! I am here to fight for you!\" Asia shouted with a smile on her face as she ran across the room in his direction, and those that knew who Asia was couldn't help but sweat drop when they started to count down in their own heads what was going to happen before it actually happened.\n\n'Boosted Gear... and Twilight Healing. What. The. FUCK!?' Rias thought as she watched Asia run towards Naruto with a smile on her face, before she wobbled and fell right on her face before she began to skid avrocc the ground for a few feet. Naruto face palmed when Asia landed on her face with her butt sticking in the air, and she stayed in that position for a few moments and everyone that wasn't stiffened in fear was now laughing at how this so called challenger.\n\n\"You see Otouto, this is your night in bloody red armor... now don;t you feel like a speciel princess nya.\" Kuroka teased in a way that only Naruto was able to hear thanks to his amazing hearings, and while Koneko was able to hear it, she didn't react to it at all. Naruto's face twitched at being called a princess, before he snorted when he realized just how true the situatiuon was making that statement. Asia had an armored gauntlet on her arm, and he was in the same situation as many of the princesses in story books were. He was about to be married to somebody he didn't love, so his knight was going to rescue him from a loveless life and kissed to cement their own love. In a way, Asia was his knight in red armor, just the thought made him want to chuckle for real when he looked at their positions in this.\n\nAsia Argento, his beautiful knight in armor... what a funny thought.\n\n\"Owchie... I'm up!\" Asia shouted as she stood back to her feet with a serious, for her, look to her face as she started to run towards Naruto again with a large red mark on her forehead. Naruto face palmed again when he realized something.\n\nAsia Argento, his clumsy knight in armor... he was screwed.\n\n\"This... this is the challenger?\" Ravel asked out loud with disbelief in her tone, while Ophis looked towards them and nodded lightly.\n\n\"I, heard her prayer.\" Ophis said simply, as if it explained everything about the situation.\n\n\"Ophis-sama heard Asia-san pray to God for a way to stop the wedding, so she had us all bring her to said wedding so that she could stop it. She has told us much about you... Uzumaki-san. I hope to one day face the you from her stories in a battle.\" Arthur stated seriously, while Naruto tilted his head in confusion at the name, before his right palm started to burn light somebody had forced the entire sun into the palm of his hand. Naruto gripped his hand and looked towards Ophis, while she looked back at him... with actual emotion in her eyes. If only he could decide if the emotion was good or bad.\n\n\"I, will see you at another time.\" Ophis said as she turned around and started to walk out of the room with the people she brought with her coming along as well. Naruto felt the strange urge to chase after her, before she turned her head and looked at him straight in the eyes again. \"Uzumaki Naruto, seek me out when you remember.\" Ophis stated without revealing anything other than that name again, while Naruto gripped his hand even tighter before the burning sensation vanished.\n\nEveryone breathed a sigh of relief when Ophis and her group left the room, while Ravel looked towards Asia when she stopped in front of them.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Ravel asked with narrowed eyes, her confidence returning to her now that Ophis and the more powerful people were out of the room. The only power house from the group still in the room seemed to be Kuroka, and she was just standing behind Naruto with a smirk playing across her lips. Asia looked up towards Ravel on top of the steps with determination in her eyes, and the green gem of her second Sacred Gear glowing.\n\n\"My name is Asia Argento, and I am here to challenge you for Naruto-kun's hand in marraige.\" Asia said with her eyes glinting with the desire to help Naruto, while Naruto looked at her sadly without saying a thing. He knew he should stop her, but he also knew that if he were in her place that he would do the exact same thing. That was why he knew that if he tried to stop her then he would be spitting on her desire and pride, something the girl didn't have a lot of in the first place. If she was going to challenge Ravel to a fight, then Naruto would support her without getting in the way... so long as her life wans't placed in danger.\n\n\"I refuse, officiater, continue with the wedding.\" Ravel stated simply as she turned to the man in charge of the wedding bonds. Her eyes narrowed when she saw him looking into his book and reading something, so with her temper being tested she slammed her foot into the ground and glared at him. \"Commoner, I told you to continue!\" Ravel said with a bit of her noble side taking over with her temper flaring. Today was her wedding day with the one she had fallen for at first sight, and she was not about to risk it over some little... NUN that thought she had a right to a devil's hand in matrimony. It was obvious that this girl was a human nun, anyone could see it from her clothes and cross necklass.\n\n\"I can't... should the man in question agree with the battle for his hand, then you must accept the challenge or surrender his hand to the young miss. It is an old and unused tradition, but sitll very much valid. Should the young mister agree with this, then the challenge will be considered official and take place above any other agreement before hand. I can not start the wedding again until the young mister has stated his opinion.\" The officiater stated and everyone looked towards Naruto, while he looked down at the ground slightly. He looked towards Asia, and he could see her pleading with her eyes to allow her to do this for him. He then looked at everyone in the audience and could see most of them wanted to see a fight, to see some more drama. Ravel was gritting her teeth at the annoyance, before she looked at Asia with anger present in her stare.\n\n\"I... I agree with this. If Asia wants to challenge Ravel for my hand, then let her.\" Naruto stated with his eyes closed, not knowing that Asia was sending him a thankful smile at letting her help him for once. To show that she would protect him, just like he protected her, even if she had to place her life on the line like he did with his when he protected her from the Fallen Angels. He risked his status, he freedom, and his life for her when he saved her, and now she would do the same for him. She had already given away her arm, and arm that she could never truly gain back to what it truly was. Her new left arm was proof of that, and if she needed to risk her life as well then she woud gladly do that... he had already done so for her after all.\n\n\"Very well, then I accept... but know this Asia Argento... for interupting my wedding day. I will not show you any mercy. I will destroy you, not kill you, I will make you watch after losing as I seal my marriage with a kiss. You interupted my wedding day, and you will pay for disrespecting me.\" Ravel stated with her eyes glarfing hate down at the nun below her, her natural enemy was in front of her and had ruined her most important day. Asia wasn't afraid though as she looked back up at Ravel with guts.\n\n\"I hate fighting, but for Naruto-kun I will defeat you... I swear to God that I will save Naruto-kun from you.\" Asia stated right back at Ravel as she used her human hand to hold the silver cross around her neck up to her lips as she made the oath to win the fight against Ravel. Ravel hissed lightly at the cross and backed up a step, before she returned to her firm stance and glared again.\n\nPhoenix vs. Dragon  \nDevil vs. Nun  \nUnholy vs. Holy\n\nThe fight for the hand of Naruto, was about to begin.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t41. Chapter 41 Phoenix vs Dragon\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n_Follow my advice Partner, and you might win._\n\n\"Right!\" Asia answered Ddraig out loud, even though she was the only person that was able to hear his voice at the moment. The fight was about to begin, and she was trying her hardest to think up some kind of battle plan. She had been watching teh Rating Game with Rias and her peerage, so unlike Ravel she knew what her opponent was able to do, and the weaknesses of her skills thanks to the fact that Naruto had already defeated Ravel in battle. Ravel was more powerful than she was, way more powerful than she was actually. So powerful that she wasn't sure of her own chances of winning even though she knew the weaknesses to Ravel's move set. Ravel was just stronger and faster than she was... right now.\n\n\"Stop talking to yourself _Nun_.\" Ravel commented with her nose scrunched in in disgust at having to fight for her man, and with a holy woman. She was being forced to fight against a human for the right to get married with the person she had been after for years. Secretely plotting and training so that she could get him, and while she lost in strength against Naruto, she had still managed to push him into both a corner in a fight, and in the fact that his honor made him agree with the agreement. She had worked her ass off training, studying up on the bodies of the Nekoshou so that she would be prepared for anything that he could pull, or in case he ever got hurt and needed special healing. All her work and studying was for nothing if this girl won... not if she had anything to say about it.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nAsia felt her power and abilities completely double, even her already moderately high magical levels doubles from what they were to new levels when the doubling ability of the Boosted Gear made her twice as powerful as she was before. That was the special thing about the Boosted Gear, it took everything about your power and multiplied it by 2 every 10 seconds. So in another 10 seconds she would be 4 times as strong as she was when she started. In 10 seconds from that point, she would be 8 times stronger than her usual self. After that the next boost would make her 16 times stronger than when she started out, something that already exceeded the abilities of most humans. After that her power would be 32 times that of what it was when she started out, something that would make her 32 times as strong and as fast as she had been. Even a child's strength multiplied by that much would be powerful by human standerds, and that in 1 minute of boosting herself with a total of 6 boosts her power would be a grand total of 64 times what her normal limits were.\n\n60 seconds was all she needed to hold out and she would be 64 times as strong as she was when she started, and then in another 10 seconds she would be 128 times as strong as the normal Asia. Her body was more than able to take the stress of that, because she had always had a rather active lifestyle so she was healthy. Her base abilities weren't as high as a devils, but when she could keep doubling her power then her base stats weren't as important when she could easily go passed them. Of course, she could only boost up to a certain point before her body couldn't boost anymore because of the stress, so base abilities were rather important. She had also been told that if something happened to her then the boosting would go back to zero.\n\n\"Boost?\" Ravel questioned with narrowed eyes when the sounding of the word 'Boost' came from the green gem on Asia's gauntlet. Ravel rolled her eyes when she noticed Asia running at her at a surprisingly high speed for somebody of her race, gender, and age. Of course, Ravel was only talking about when comparing Asia to other humans. To a devil, Asia was moving pretty slow, so Ravel just waisted for Asia to come to her as she ran with his fist pulled back. Asia showed her zero fighting experience by shouting out an amateur battle cry when she threw an amazingly _sloppy_ punch. Ravel just caught the fist with her hand and pulled her own fist back and slugged Asia in the face. Asia didn't know what hit her when the sound of her nose crunching was heard, and blood escaped her nose as tears started to automatically gather at her eyes. Ravel yanked Asia towards her again and pulled her fist back again, before Asia's worl was pain when Ravel punched her in the middle of the chest so hard that she was knocked from her feet and sent rolling on the ground coughing.\n\n'So... powerful!' Were Asia's very first thoughts on the matter as pain erupted from her nose and chest from both hits. Tears were falling from her eyes just at the fact that she had been slugged in the nose, and she had the wind knocked out of her when Ravel kicked her in the rips so hard that a crack was hard and she was sent flying through the air with blood coming from her mouth as well as nose before she hit the ground and shouted out in agony at the beating she was getting.\n\n\"You don't stand a chance against me human, so save face and give up before I melt your face off.\" Ravel threatened, before Asia coughed up blood into her hand and started to slowly stand up despite the pain that she was in. Her Twilight Healing appeared on her right hand, while she placed her dragon hands against her chest. Ravel watched with wide eyes as Asia's hands started to glow green as a the damage to her nose fixed itself right away, and the popping sound showed that her rips were fixed as well from the damage that had been inflicted to them.\n\n_Boost_\n\n\"I will endure any pain for the one I love. Nothing you can do to me will hurt me more than losing him.\" Asia stated truthfully as she started to run at Ravel again, only this time ravel had her eyes widened when Asia ran at her at the same amount of speed as a Low-Class newly reincarnated devil, showing that she had already exceeded the limits of a normal human by dfoing this... boost thing twice. Her speed was still slow to Ravel, but it was the increase in speed that was so surprising to her. She still caught Asia's next punch with just the same amount of ease as the last one, even if there was a lot more force behind this punch. Ravel pulled Asia in close, before she knee'd the woman in the gut and knocked the wind from her lungs again, before Asia took a bad punch to the jaw that busted the skin on her chin wide open with blood pouring from her chin. Asia didn't have the time to recover before Ravel stomped on her foot and broke that next, before she gave Asia a headbutt to the forehead with such force that Asia was nearly knocked out with that one blow. She was lucky to be awake when she hit the ground again, and blood was pouring out of her forehead and chin from the bleeding breaks in her skin.\n\n\"Nothing you do can change the difference in skill... you have zero experience fighting. I am stronger, faster, and I was trained in my families style of fighting. I am an immortal bird, and you are a lowly human that is in over her head.\" Ravel gloated to the pained Asia, before Asia placed her hands on her head and foot and the same green glow from earlier healed her in half of the time that it had taken the other time healing. The Boosted Gear increased everything about Asia, including the strength of her other abilities... that included the healing strength of the Twilight Healing since it was part of her body. Asia put her hands on the ground, before she kicked off on the ground and set off in a dead run towards Ravel.\n\n_Boost_\n\n'Faster... and stronger.' Ravel thought with narrowed eyes when she moved out of the way as Asia's fist sailed passed her head, and she knee's Asia in the gut as she was passing by. She summoned fire around her fist, before she punched Asia in the side of the head and sent her several dozen meters away from her. She was surprised when Asia stood up right away and started to run at her again with determination in her eyes, and she placed her human hand on her burnt head and the damage to her body quickly healed. Ravel looked at her fist for a moment when she remembered how hard Asia's head seemed to become between each boost call. She jumped out of the way easily when Asia started to chase after her with fists drawn back.\n\n\"Ddraig-san, I need more power!\" Asia called out with a certain urgency in her voice, before Ddraig remained completely silent inside her. She threw two punches towards Ravel, and the Phenex girl moved out of the way of both punches, before she returned fire with two punches of her own that struck true and smashed into Asia's eye and shoulder with each hit. Asia placed her human hadn over her eye, before she threw a punch at Ravel as hard as she could and almost hit her target if it weren;t for the fact that Ravel dodged by the skin of her teeth and jumped up in the air before she summoned her flaming wings and sent Asia flying with fire following after her when the ground exploded in flames.\n\n\"No matter how much power you get, I am a better fighter than you. Naruto doesn't need a weakling by his side. We are going to be the new power couple of our generation.\" Ravel bragged as she sent a large stream of flame towards the downed Asia with the full intent of roasting the girl alive. The flames struck true, because moments later the smell of burnt grass... grass? Ravel looked at the spot where Asia had been when she had started her bout of flames, before she saw that Asia wasn't there. She looked around and saw a flash of blonde move behind one of the large Bishop statues in the battle field. She narrowed her eyes at how Asia was running away at a good speed, before she heard something that she was starting to hate.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n\"Oh hell no, this _farce_ has gone on long enough!\" Ravel shouted as she pointed her hand right at the Bishop statue and sent a powerful ball of flames at the statue and completely destroyed the entire thing in an explosion of flames that engulfed everything around the statue. Her rage powering her flames with more demonic power than normal, making her already enhances magic even more powerful.\n\n\"It isn't a farce!\"\n\n\"What!?\" Ravel shouted in shock, before a red metal fist slammed into the top of her head and forced her neck to jerk down as she was made to look right at the ground. She heard the sound of Asia's feet touching the ground, before flames erupted from the back of her head when the damage done to her was completely fixed. Her head shot up, and she looked towards Asia as the girl started to run away faster than ever before. Ravel sent a large fireball towards Asia, but she was annoyed that Asia was able to run out of the range of her fireball before she hide behind the statue of a giant Knight piece. Ravel flapped her wings and took to the sky before she flew towards where she had last seen Asia, something that took her a few second to do.\n\nAsia started to run around the Knight statue as the wind whipped her hair behind her at the speeds she was reaching on her own instead of from when she was being carried by a supernatural being. She avoided every fireball that was sent at her, since they were all too slow to truly catch her as she was at this moment. She was forced from her feet and sent skidding across the ground as a gust of wind hit her, but she scampered from the ground and narrowing avoided getting burned up by another stream of fire that was being made to follow after her. She was having more trouble avoiding those than she was the slower, but stronger, fireballs.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nAsia's body was flooded with more power as her speed increased by double, making her zip across the grass with her blonde hair almost making her seem like a yellow blur when she ran around Ravel's attacks. She yelled in shock when she tripped over her own two feet and started to skid across the ground, before she rolled around across the ground with some small amount of pain in her chest from her breasts smacking against the ground.\n\n\"You die now!\" Ravel shouted from the sky as she sent a massive barrage as many fireballs towards the now fallen Asia as she could. She sent as many powerful but small exploding fireballs towards the ground as she blew up everything that moved under her. She heard a pained shout, and she started to increase the number of fireballs she was sending until she was sure that Asia was going to be dead or near dead from the damage. She stopped sending fireballs at the ground when a cloud of dust started to form around the area, and her eyes looked towards the ground trying to find Asia before she could pull anything like boosting again.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nAsia came bursting from the dust as she soared through the air... way far off from where Ravel was. The Phenex sweat dropped at the fact that Asia had completely missed her target without even meaning to, and was now falling towards the ground while waving her arms and shouting as she reentered the dust cloud down bellow.\n\n\"Idiot... she is a clumsy idiot. Naruto would have been able to track me in the air by the sound of my wings flapping.\" Ravel muttered to herself, before she saw Asia running out of the dust using the ground instead of the air. Ravel clinked her teeth in annoyance when she started to figure out Asia's power.\n\nThat boost call meant that she doubled her natural abilities. Not just strength and speed, but she was also doubling her durability so go with it. The mnore she doubles, the closer she came to closing the gap between the two of them. Ravel thought about it for a second, and to test a theory she just waited and started to count down in her head how much time she thought Asia would have left.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n'So she has to wait between 10 and 15 seconds before her power grows... useful. I need to defeat her before she can do it again.' Ravel thought as she flew towards the ground as quicky after Asia as she could, knowing that the number of times that the word boost had been called out equalled 6. That would mean that if she was right, then Asia's power doubles every time... that would place Asia at 64 times her usual limits on strength. With each boost Asia's power was increasing by more and more, before soon it wouldn't matter if she wasn't a good fighter. The bruiet force would be enough to actually close the distance between them. She quickly caught up with Asia, and reaching out she grabbed the back of the girl's hair and yanked back so that Asia tumbled to the ground.\n\nRavel landed on top of Asia, before she pulled her fist back and lit it on fire before she rained down punch after punch on Asia's head without any mercy given. Ravel narrowed her eyes when she saw only light burns appearing on Asia from the blows. Raising both of her hands together, she increased the potency of the flames and slammed her hands into Asia's head hard enough to crack the ground under it. Not lightening up, she started to nail Asia over and over again now that her head was weakened.\n\n'I can't scream... Naruto would accept the pain and push passed it.' Asia thought as she winced over and over again with each hit of her head.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n_EXPLOSION!_\n\nRavel's eyes widened at the new call, before pain erupted in her gut when Asia landed a point blank blow that actually hurt her for a few moments before she was forced to release her. Asia kicked her off of her, before she stood up and started to run towards Ravel while panting from a slight case of physical exhaustion. This new power flooding her body was far behind the usual doubling of her abilities, and she was able to now gain the slight advantage as she managed to punch Ravel in the face again and again in the dear hopes that she could knock the girl out with sheer force to the head.\n\n\"I'm sorry for doing this, please know I don't want to hurt YOU!?\" Asia stated, before she yelled in shock when her wrists were grabbed by Ravel with her head sprouting flames from all the damage she was trying to heal quickly. All that was seen of her face was her snarl and her left eye glaring up at Asia, before the rest of her face was healed and her head returned to normal.\n\n\"Well I want to hurt YOU!\" Ravel shouted back as she flipped the two of them over, before she used her flaming hand to slap Asia across the face with a red hand print appearing on her cheek. Grabbing the sides of Asia's head, Ravel slammed their heads together with her head healing right away from the damage she took from her headbutt.\n\n_Reset._\n\nAsia's eyes widened when she felt all of the power inside her just vanish as she returned to her starting stats at the very beginning of the match. Ravel punched Asia in the face, and the girl was surprised when Asia's nose broke as more blood covered the lower half of her face from the crushed nose. Earlier Asia's defence had increased to the point that she was about equal to that of Naruto's skin defence, and now she was back to her normal human abilities. Ravel smirked and grabbed Asia's hair before pulling her up so that their faces were inches apart.\n\n\"So, the explode traded all of your boosting for explosive power... but when that power is over you return to your normal self... such a pathetic ability. If you don't defeat your opponent in time, you are almost promised to lose.\" Ravel stated with a smirk when Asia moaned in pain, her eyes freely allowing tears to flow down her face with the blood coming from her nose.\n\n_Partner, show her our power. Use what you have to your advantage._\n\n\"Use... what I have?\" Asia moaned out loud, while Ravel looked at her with a smirk before her hand was lit on fire again. She pulled Asia towards her and slowly pulled her face towards the flames, and heat licking at her skin and making her wince, before she moved her hand towards her skirt pocket. Pulling out a bottle, Ravel didn't even have another moment of time to wonder about that before she was splashed in the face with water. Her eyes widened, before she grabbed her face and jumped away from Asia while screaming death at Asia with her face and palms being burned by one of the things all devils fears.\n\nHoly Water.\n\nAsia was a nun, so of course she carried around Holy Water and wore her cross wherever she went.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n\"Ahhh! You damn nun, I am going to roast you alive and then turn you into shit you are when I feed you to my pets!\" Ravel yelled with her agony warping her mind with a combination of anger and pain maing her more rash. Her hands and face were killing her, and the flames that kept erupting from her hands showed that she wasn't healing from getting hit with the water that was used by a real nun. Asia took this as her chance to heal herself as she placed her hands on her face and made sure that she could still heal her face, and then when a few seconds passed she was completely healed, but her energy and stamina was further drained.\n\n_Partner, you are holding back. You are a pacifist by nature, so muster up all of your anger and direct it at your opponent. Gain the desire to hurt her._\n\nAsia gasped when she heard Ddraig tell her to get angry, but if he knew her then he would know that getting angry and wanting to really hurt somebody was against her beliefs.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nAsia decided to gain some distance between herself and the furious Ravel before she got the chance to fully heal, so ducking behind the nearest Queen statue she held her dragon arm in front of her face and for a moment saw her own blood covered face from the beating she had been taking today.\n\n\"Why do you want me to get angry Ddarig-san?\" Asia asked a little bit nervously.\n\n_Balance Breaker, the Forbidden Move that all Sacred Gears are activated when the user has a hiugh enough emotion, or when experience a change of heart or spirit. For a peace lover like you, getting angry and gaining the desire to hurt somebody will be enough to allow you activate your Balance Breaker. _\n\n\"Do I need it to win?\" Asia asked Ddraig, and the gauntlet was silent for a moment.\n\n_No, with your cross and Holy Water with myself and your Twilight Healing you can win, but the Balance Breaker will eb the quickest way. You have been using uour Twilight Healing for years, so you have high magical reserves... your body can hold the Balance Breaker long enough for you to win easily. As you are, your body can only handle about 9 or 10 more Boosts total before your body gives out._\n\n\"How long will magic magic keep the Balance Breaker going?\" Asia asked in an unsure tone of voice, before there was a large explosion and the sound of Ravel shouting for her to come out was heard. Asia gulped, knowing that she was doomed if she went out their with only 4 times her normal power.\n\n_If you were at full power, I would say you could get at most 18 minutes with the Balance Breaker, but as you are maybe you could get 3 minutes._\n\n\"Can you transfer your power to my Holy Water?\" Asia asked lowly so that she wasn't heard by the rampaging Ravel blwoing everything up. Her responce was for Ddraig's gem to glow, and the hand with the Holy Water boosted up with the water glowing a green color. She felt her power drop back down to her usual level as all of the power she had was placed into the Holy Water.\n\n_Boost_\n\nAsia peeked around the corner, before she jolted when she saw Ravel looking at her with burns on the girl's face. Travel pointed her hand at Asia without talking, and flames erupted from her palm and shot ayt Asia. Asia ran out of the way of the flames as fast as she could, but the back of her dess caught on fire and she was forced to roll on the ground for a few seconds... and by luck she dodged another bout of flames shot at her with the intent of burning her down to her bones. She looked at the damage to her clothes, before she saw that the back of her thighs were showing now. Running away from Ravel to buy as much time as she could, she knew thayt Ravel would catch up to her quickly. Asia started to pant lightly as her physical stamina was drained from her from her use of the Boosted Gear, but placing her hand on the back of her thigh she started to heal the little burns on her body slowing her down.\n\n_Boost_\n\n\"No you aren't! I won't let you buy anymore time!\" Ravel shouted when she appeared in front of Asia and bitch slapped the girl hard enough to send her flying far enough so that her back slammed into the stone of the Queen statue. Ravel held her hand out as white sparks started to form at the palm of her hand, before those sparks burst into white flames that were so hot that even from her spot dozens and dozens of meters away Asia could feel the heat from super condensed flames. \"This is it, I am killing you right now human! I won't be made a fool of like this anymore. Nova Burner!\" Ravel shouted out as she held her wrist with her free hand and started to finish up her attack for safe use.\n\n_Boost_\n\n'Gotta heal myself and dodge.' Asia thought as she bent her arm back so that her human hanbd was touching her back, and moments later her back was healed from most of the damage that she had taken from slamming her back into the stone.\n\n_Partner, watch out!_\n\nThe next thing Asia knew was complete pain when Ravel appeared in front of her and imapled her through the chest with her flaming arm. Asia spat out blood, not spat, no Asia was vomiting blood in large amount down onto Ravel's arm when the girl leaned forward and whispered into her ear.\n\n\"I told you I wouldn't show any mercy, you are to dangerous to let live. This Sacred Gear is a Longinus, and you are getting better at using it through out the entire battle. I can't risk you winning, so just die.\" Ravel whispered as the Queen statue behind Asia exploded from just touching the Nova Burner. Asia was gasping for air as Ravel took her hand out of Asia's chest and let the girl fall the the gorund while holding onto her right breast where there was a caterized hole going through one side and out of the other, with no blood escaping the wound, making it even more painful than just being impaled. She started to puke up more blood onto the ground, before she started to get a bit dizzy.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n'I... can't lose here.' Asia thought as she tried to move her right arm, but found that she couldn't even make her finger twitch on that side. So falling onto her back, she watched as Ravel started to walk away with her back turned to her. Using her dragon hand, she moved the Twilight Healing connected to the gauntlet over the hole in her chest, before she started to heal the wound the best she could. She thanked the fact that the wound was completely caterized, because if not she would have bled out by this point. The wound started to seal itself up as perfectly healed skin made it's presence known to the world, and even her breast itself started to heal up until it was back to her normal size and shape. The Nova Burner had destroyed the lower part of her right breast as well, so having that back felt nice.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nStanding up with major pain from the aftershocks of the attack, she started to have trouble standing from all the bloodloss from the previous attacks and other cases of her spilling her own blood. Ravel wasn't even looking at her, and she was walking back towards the castle with a prim and proper look to her.\n\n_Boost!_\n\nRavel was going to tell everyone that Naruto belonged to her now... she was going to take Naruto away from her. She was going to make... her boyfriend marry her when he didn't want to marry her! Naruto was going to be force to marry this girl because of the fact that Asia was afraid to hurt somebody... but violence was never the answer to any problems. How could she just hurt somebody, even an enemy? It was against her nature to hurt others, and she didn't want to fight against Ravel. For this entire match she hadn't been trying to kill Ravel like Ravel was trying to kill her. She felt power flooding her body as she hit her 6th boost of power again, before she stared at Ravel, who finally noticed the power increasing behind her.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n\"No way... you survived the Nova Burner!? How?! Only the tears of my family should be able to heal the damage done by that move, so how could your little dragon arm heal that... another Sacred Gear... you have two Sacred Gears!\" Ravel shouted in anger when she finally noticed that this entire time Asia had been using two Sacred Gears at the same time to make herself seem more powerful. Ravel didn't get another chance to say anything, because Asia ran at Ravel with her new full speed and slammed her forehead into Ravel's... only for Ravel to start screaming again when blood started to shoot out of her forehead. Liquid could be seen coming from Asia's head, showing that she had coated her head and hands with the enhances Holy Water.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't let you have Naruto-kun!\" Asia shouted with with a sincere sadness in her tone at causing somebody else sadness, before she punched Ravel in the jaw with her left fist. The very same one that was covered in red metal armor and enhances Holy Water. Ravel went flying, before she smashed not into, but through one of the stone statues and walled into the stone wall surrounded the flame covering area. The wall craters and large cracks appeared on it, and sticking against the wall was a knocked out Ravel with her head hanging down towards the ground.\n\nWell, she had not only been hit with Holy Water multiple times, but she had also wasted so much power in her rage as well as getting punched in the jaw with enhances Holy Water that was covering a metal gauntlet... not to mention that the punch itself was 256 times Asia's normal strength. Asia had been able to boost 8 times, so after the intitial boost she had been able to double her power and attacking ability with boost after that.\n\n2 - 4 - 8 - 16 - 32 - 64 - 128 - 256\n\nAsia started to wobble on her feet, before the ground around them started to vanish as the two fo them were being teleported back to the castle now that the winner had been picked. The next thing Asia knew was that she was wrapped up in a pair of arms and with a scent she was familiar with appearing when she took a smell of the air. She started to fade in an out, but she felt something press up against her lips and the very last thing she saw before passing out was Naruto kissing her with tears running down his cheeks at seeing her covered in so much of her own blood.\n\n\"I... won.\" Were Asia's lat words, before all she knew was darkness.\n\n\"Thank you Asia... so much.\" Naruto said back to her when a group of nobles started to take Ravel back to her room so that she could sleep off the her injuries and get treated by her parents.\n\nIn the fight between the Phoenix and the Dragon for the Tiger's heart.\n\nThe Dragon won.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**The Boosted Gear is a Longinus Level Sacred Gear, one of the 12 Strongest Sacred Gears to ever exist. Combine that with a Holy Water and Twilight Healing, and you got a badass combination.**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t42. Chapter 42 Warning - S\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Warning: Sexual Content A.K.A. LEMON!**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'I am so conflicted about this.' Koneko thought as she walked towards the room that Asia was using in their apartment. Asia was completely healed from all her leftover bruises that she had missed during the fight, and really she didn't have many physical injuries on her by the end of the fight. She was just covered in a lot of blood, and even if it were her own blood she had take care of the injuries herself. Koneko had been watching the entire fight with her brother, and she had seen the genuine hurt on his face when Asia got hurt. She had also seen him almost lose it when Asia was impaled through the chest, something that just didn't happen as much with Naruto. He was an amazimngly calm person about a lot of things, so seeing him almost break down when he saw Asia nearly die killed her a little inside.\n\nThat was why she was going to let go of her anger at Asia for stealing her brother from her, and taking his attention. Asia now had the right in Koneko's eyesa to court her brother after actually fighting for him, even if she got her ass handed to her for most of the fight. She had stuck in there and gained enough power to knock Ravel out, something that even Koneko couldn't do no matter how hard she fought. That showed that Asia was strong enough to stand by her brother's side... even if she was starting to doubt if Asia would ever be willing to fight somebody if Naruto wasn't on the line. The girl really seemed to hate fighting with a passion, which was good, because a nun that liked to fight holding both the Boosted Gear and Twilight Healing would be a real problem for whoever her opponent was. The Boosted Gear was one of the most powerful of the Longinus, Sacred Gears with the power to kill a god. That kind of power in the hands of a holy woman was scary, not to mention she could heal almost any wound done to her with her Twilight Healing.\n\nAsia had the potential to be one of the most powerful people alive if she ever started to train herself.\n\nShe opened the door to Asia's room, and walking in she noticed that her brother was already there next to Asia, with his head on the side of the bed with light snores coming from his mouth. Meaning that he must have fallen asleep waiting for her to wake up, and Asia sent her a small look with her finger on her lips showing that she didn't want to wake Naruto up. Koneko nodded and started to come into the room a bit more quietly than she had planned to, so sitting down at the edge of the bed she looked up towards the ceiling with a small frown on her face. Koneko sighed, before she looked towards Asia before raising an eyebrow when she noticed that the Boosted Gear was still activated on Asia's arm. She wondered what Asia was preparing for if she already had it out, and she sent that kind of curious glace twards Asia.\n\n\"Your Sacred Gear is active.\" Koneko whispered lightly, but still loud enough for Asia to hear her clearly. Asia sent her own arm a slightly sad look as she raised it up towards her chest level and just made her fingers move around. The red scaled fingers that were originally hers, and the green gem that contained the power of a dragon. She had traded her arm away for the power to help Naruto, and while it made the power of the gear stronger she could never really get her arm back to what it once was. She would always have this arm, but she wasn't surprised that Koneko didn't know about this yet. Right now both Rias and Akeno were informed and trying to think of ways to allow her to at least hide the Sacred Gear and gain her human hand back.\n\nThey figured out so far that the reason that her arm was always in the transformed state was because there was the fact that the dragon's power was constantly building up inside her arm and keeping the gauntlet maintained without needing to be truly active.\n\n\"Rias-san and Akeno-san said that unless the dragon's power can be drained from the arm, then it can't go back to normal.\" Asia commented with a light sigh. Rias had also mentioned that even if the dragon's power was scattered, it would still build up again and eventually need to be scattered again. That would mean that while it might be possible to make her arm look human again, her arm would always be this in reality. Her arm would always try and turn back into the Boosted Gear, so she would need to get the power scattered from the arm a few times a week or even day just to make the arm take a more normal look to it. That wasn't to say she regret doing this, because if she had to she would do it again without hesitation, but she felt weird having such a strange arm.\n\n\"I see... and you did this for Otouto?\" Koneko questioned with an idle, but seemingly neutral, tone that didn't say what her intentions for the question were. She was honestly curious to know what could drive a person to trade their own arm away for somebody that they have barely known for a month. Asia hadn't known Naruto for very long, but she was already willing to go against her morals and fight for him showed that her feelings for him were just as real as the feelings that Ravel had gotten for him over years preparing and spying. Even Koneko could admit that Ravel had truly been in love with her brother, but her brother didn't the feelings at the time so she was against a forced marraige.\n\n\"I couldn't let him keep beung everyone's pillar, when he didn't have support of his own. I wanted to become his pillar for when he was down... trading an arm wasn't that big of a price. I would do it again if I had to.\" Asia answered softly as she layed her non-dragon hand on top of Naruto's head. Even if she had been the one fighting, the one that had faced the most stress this entire time was indeed Naruto. He had been emotionally stressed for the entire thing, and he had to atch the girl he was falling for nearly die multiple times. She may have been physically hurt, but his heart was more hurt than her body was. Asia knew this, and she was proud opf herself for being able to save him in the end. Now they could both heal from their mental wounds together, because even she had some mental stress. She had fought somebody and hurt them, that went against her nature as a person. Naruto stirred under her head, before he started to open his eyes and get up slowly with a wide stretch of his limbs.\n\n\"Mmmmm! Morning nya.\" Naruto said with a smile on is face, and he then noticed his sister in the same room as him and Asia before he sent her a smile as well. \"Morning Onee-chan nya.\" Naruto greeted with the same smile as always, his mood having drastically improved now that he wasn't being forced to marry somebody he didn't love.\n\n\"Morning Otouto... what was that Uzumaki business?\" Koneko asked with a raised eyebrow, bringing up the fact that Ophis the Dragon-God seemed to know him by that name. Naruto looked just as confused as she was for a few moments, before he seemed to have some sort of answer ready when he opened his mouth.\n\n\"I don't really know, but the name really rings a bell with me nya.\" Naruto stated with a thoughtful look on his face. He was telling the truth when he said that the name seemed very familiar to him... like that was part of something he had been missing for a long time now. He wasn't sure why, but he really liked the name... Naruto Uzumaki... that seemed to roll of the tongue much better than Naruto Toujou, the name Rias had branded him with. With a thoughtful expression on his face he considered the name in his head more and more. Maelstrom Whirlpool... yeah, that sounded pretty cool. Even Fishcake Whirpool sounded cooler than Fishcake Castle like his current name was. Maelstrom Castle was nice, but it didn't have the same ring to it as Maelstrom Whirlpool.\n\n\"... I believe you. I will tell Buchou that you don't know how Ophis knows you... try not to have too much fun.\" Koneko said with a small smile on her face as she got up and started to walk out of the room. She didn't care about Asia's confused look, while Naruto smiled lightly at Koneko fully accepting Asia as Naruto's love interest. That was just her way of telling him that she approved of Asia. She was also telling him something else.\n\nKoneko was telling him that now was his chance to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh with Asia... he hoped. If she was talking about something else, and then came back to him and Asia in the middle of doing the deed then he would be so embarrassed. That was why as soon as Koneko was gone Naruto smiled wider with a slight excited look to his face, before he turned towards Asia and hopped onto the bed so that he was on top of her legs and staring at her in the face.\n\n\"You know... you won the duel for my hand in marraige nya.\" Naruto said with a large smile on his face as he pressed his head against Asia's. She smiled in return, before the two of them began a slow kiss. Nothing big at this point, just a kiss where Naruto and Asia's lips met in a light union. Naruto moved his hands to the back of her head and pressed a little bit harder into the kiss, shoving his feelings into the action with a glad passion.\n\n'This feels... good... great.' Asia thought as she kissed back with as much passion as a girl with no kissing experience could. Naruto wanted to laugh at how awkward she seemed with the kiss, not in the cruel way, but it was funny just how strange this much be to Asia. Her kiss was soft, but she was pressing her lips against him to try and deepen it without actually deepening the kiss. His kiss was slightly awkward as well, but Kuroka had always told him about as much of her kissing knowledge as she could. He had been given a detailed explaination on how to kiss a girl, so while he didn't have any true experience, he had a check list of what was good and not good to do. That was why when he stopped kissing her so that she could breath, he looked at her with a small smile. She was blushing lightly, but the smile on her face still showed true. She moaned slightly when Naruto leaned down and started to kiss on her neck slightly, peppering her soft skin with kisses so light that you would think a butterfly was walking over her skin. Her arms wrapped around his body without a thought about it, before he nipped at her neck lightly and caused her to jolt a little at the surprise nip. His teeth lightly grazing her, before he kissed the spot that he nipped at gently, getting her to shiver when lightning ran down her spine and she seized up a little.\n\nNaruto lightly pushed his body against Asia's and forced her to lay down on the bed again so that he could lay down on top of her and continue his kissing from a better position. Naruto stuck his tongue out just like when he marked her as his, before he licked at the light red spots that his nipping had made. He didn't care if he was going to leave hickies on Asia after this was over, every hickie was just another mark that showed that they were a couple. They were a couple alone in an apartment together, and most of all... they were set to be married because of Asia beating Ravel. What they were doing wasn't just teenage smut, but a real expression of love between future husband and wife... it was most likely the reason that Asia wasn't making an attempt to stop him. She may be ignorant of the world, but she knew what sex actually was, even if she was oblivious to perversion itself. The fact she was clueless abotu what actually made sex fun was more fun for him, they could learn about the wonders of sex first hand.\n\nAsia was more than willing for him to do as he pleased he she moved her head to the side to allow him more room to work on her. Naruto moved a little lower, and her scooted his lower half back against Asia so that their crotched were pressed together and he was laying flat on her with his face pressed into her shoulder. Naruto tsk'd that the pesky clothes of her pajamas getting in the way of her white skin, before he sat up and moved his hands towrds the buttons on her top. She looked away from him in response, but she nodded slightly to show that she would allow him to remove her clothes. Talking wasn't needed for the two fot hem to know what the other wanted, the complete trust between them showed even though they hadn't been together long enough for most adults to think they were in anything more than a state of lust for each other. With the first button, her smooth collarbone started to show and a small amount of skin leading down to her chest.\n\nWith the first button undone, Naruto started to follow through with the rest of his fiance's buttons before every single button on the top was undone, and the clothes were just waiting to be taken off so that the soft flesh underneath could be expoded to the world. With a swip of his hand, the sides of the top were completely moved out of the way so that Asia's chest and stomach were on proud display. Asia covered her chets the second it happened out of instinct, with her hands pressing into her own bossom Naruto couldn't help but chuckle lightly. She was just so cute when it came to how shy she could be, but how bold she could be at other times.\n\n\"Don't worry Asia-chan, you are going to be alone... your body is really beautiful, so don't be shy nya.\" Naruto encouraged her to remove her hands from her chest as he placed his hands at the oversized shirt he was wearing as his own pajama shirt the last night so that he could watch over Asia. Removing his own shirt, Asia smiled at him stripping for her as well when he showed his tanned skin. She had to admire his body, just as he admired her body. She slowly took her hands off, and her chest bounced back into place with her pink nipples now in full view for Naruto to see and lavish with attention when the time came. She placed one of her free hands on his stomach and marvelled at how toned it was, and she pressed against it to learn that his body was both rock hard and slightly soft at the very same time. Her hand moved up as she explored his lean body, she was actually more attracted to him for the fact that he didn't have abs like somebody this well muscled should have. She could see the muscle definition, and she could tell that it was powerful, but he was also built to be flexible. His body was short, so abs would look kind of weird on him anyway when he was only 15 years old.\n\nNaruto on the other hand just let her feel him up as his hand moved to her shoulder and twirled one of her stray strands of hair with his finger lightly and tenderly. Letting her hair go, Naruto felt her hand leave his body when he leaned back down and started to kiss her neck again, only now his right hand went towards her left breast and started to lightly press against the well endowed girl's chest. Asia didn't say it out loud, but her moan showed that she was pleased with his gentle touches. Naruto was trying to make this as gentle as possible, because this was not going to be just sex. This was going to be him and Asia making love, nice and gentle love making. They were expressing their tender feelings with their bodies, so being tender was something that should be done.\n\nHis hand seemingly sank into her soft breasts, and Naruto stopped kissing her when he felt Asia started to feel self-conscious with his Empathetic abilities. Naruto smiled lightly before he crawled up her body and moved his mouth against her ear and bit down on it lightly much to her bodies enjoyment when she twitched under him.\n\n\"Don't worry Asia, I like your chest way more than Rias' chest or Akeno's juggs. They are to big, but you are just right. Your chest sin't too big, or too small, and it is slightly bigger than the average girl. Even if your chest was small, or too big, I would love it all the same... because it is your chest nya.\" Naruto whispered with hot breath touching the inside of her ear and making her squirm lightly with a growing blush. Asia started to bite her lips when they started to itch a bit more some more attention, and Naruto noticed this was didn't comment over it before he pressed his lips to hers again. He noticed that Asia was breathing a little heavier than before, and she was starting to sweat lightly with her own arousal over the situation become known to Naruto as he stopped kissing her and moved down so that his face was against her over breast. Naruto used his now free hand to press against the underside of her right breast and moved it around so that her nipple was closer to his lips while bringing her the pleasure of having both of her breasts played with.\n\n_Don't ever twist a girl's nipples, only sexual idiots do that Otouto nya. It isn't hot, unless the girl is into pain. Unless she asked for it, never do it nya._\n\n'Thank god Onee-sama gave me these lessons when I was younger.' Naruto thought when he forced himself to stop from twisting when he had his fingers around her left nipple. Instead, Naruto started to lightly rub her nipple with his thumb and pointer finger. Naruto let his mouth kiss her pink nipple, before he started to suck on it... her back arched the second he did this and she moaned much louder than she ever had before. Naruto blinked a few times, before he smiled with her nipple in his mouth when he figured out one of Asia's major turn ones for sex. He had learned from Kuroka that every girl reacted to things different, some didn't get as much pleasure from the same thing as another girl, while others reacted a lot more than others.\n\nAsia had sensative nipples, and it would seem that her right right breast was a little more sensative to pleasure than her left one... oh wait, this was also the breast she had to grow back because of the hole Ravel made for her in her chest during the fight. Maybe growing back her boob made it a bit more tender, and sexually stimulating than the other one because this one was still recently regrown. Naruto didn't know for sure, but he did know that she was getting off on him sucking on her boob. She grabbed the back of his head and forced it deeper to his breast as if proving this point, so Naruto got back to work happily as he teased and lightly rubbed his teeth against the nipple without really biting her. He simply used the texture and hardness of his teeth to stimulate her even further before sucking on her again and flicking her nipple with his tongue.\n\n_For a woman's first time, it is always about her. This is really special to her, so lavish her with attention. It REALLY gets her motor running nya._\n\nNaruto finally stopped sucking on her nipple, before he began to nip around the breast without touching the nipple so that he could please as much of her as he could. The hand playing and squeezing her other breast flicked her nipple lightly, before he moved it down towards her stomach and started to give her a deep rub with the palm of his hand resting around her belly. Asia started to shake from all of the sexual stimulation that she had never gotten before in her life, she hadn't even masterbated before. Not once had the innocent Asia played with herself, so to he this was all new. She knew that the breasts could be pleasurable, she wasn't wearing a bra right now because of how sensative her chest was after being healed up.\n\nNaruto let go of her and he took her normal hand into his hand, before he made sure she was watching him with her bright green eyes. He took on of her fingers into his mouth, and she blushed heavily when she saw his tongue dart out and touch parts of her hand that weren't his mouth. Seeing no real sexual reaction from it, he took her hand out of his mouth and nodded to himself lightly.\n\nThey couldn't all be winners. Not every idea he had to please Asia could be a good one, or at least work like he wanted it too. He knew they were both inexperienced, so there was no way to tell if they were any good either. Not to mention, that Naruto hadn't fully matured yet so this was even newer to him when it came to his body being physically ready. He had known about the how, but without being able to follow through until rather recently... as in he had only been able to get sexually active if he wanted too starting last year.\n\nNaruto shook his head of those kinds of thought, and started to live in the present and he tossed the covers from Asia's body and revealed her clothes lower half. She blushed when she saw what he was going to do, before she covered her crotch even though it was already covered. Naruto sighed, before he smiled at how she was still deciding if she wanted to do this or not. Naruto smiled even further when Asia took her hands off her crotch and placed her hands at the stretchy waistbands of her bottom and lifted her hips in the air so that she could slide the bottoms of her pajamas away from her lower body. Naruto almost licked his lips when he saw that she was wearing bright pink panties with a red bow on the front of them, because now it was like she was a present to be opened up and enjoyed.\n\n\"I'm a bit nervous... please be gentle with me.\" Asia requested with a shy look towards the bulge in his boxers. Naruto nodded with a smile, knowing that she was a virgin, and because of that this was going to hurt when he ripped through her virgin barrier. That was why Naruto was going to be as gentle as possible with her... for almost cracked up when the idea of using his Transformation ability to prank Asia came to his mind. In his own mind, he had just imagined himself giving Asia a little scare by using his Transform to give himself an unrealistic penis. He would have loved to see the look of shock on her face when he pulled down his pants and showed off a 6, 7, or even the rare 8 inch that the more well endowed men seemed to have these days. It would be funny to see her stutter before transforming himself down to his natural size again... of course, now that he thought about it he might have some fun with her by using transform during sex to change the size of his penic while he was still inside of her to slowly expand and give her more pleasure... slowly so that he didn't hurt her.\n\n\"Of course Asia-chan, I would never dream of hurting you nya... but this is your first time. It will hurt a bit, so are you sure about this?\" Naruto asked to make completely sure, and he shoved his idea to the back of his mind. This was about making love with his fiance, not bragging about fucking her with some unreal dick that just wouldn't be right on somebody his shape and size. Maybe one day the two of them could experiment, but not today. Anyway, it wasn't like the length of a penis even mattered as much in sex. The width of the penis was more importan to a woman's pleasure, because it felt better for her to have her vagina's walls stretched than it did to have hit her womb. That one was said to actually hurt her, and not really feel good unless you were gentle about touching it.\n\nMost of a woman's nerves for sex were centered near the opening and the first inch or so. That would mean that even a short cock would feel good to her, and a long one would feel the exact same as the short one. True, it would feel a little better if she was wet enough, but it was all about learning what the other liked. Not every girl wanted big dicks, in fact, MOST of them wanted more realistic ones. For a virgin like Asia, she wouldn't even know the difference between the two... heck, she would be fine with whatever Naruto had because the two of them were going to be married one day. They loved each other, and during sex love and trust were the most important things needed to reach an orgasm.\n\n\"I'm sure Naruto-kun, I want this... I really do.\" Asia said more to herself at the end to give herself the courage, and she looked down at her panties in humiliation when she saw that she had literally soaked them all the way through by this point. Naruto nodded and laced his hands at the sides of her panties, before he slowly removed them and let him go down her legs before tossing them to the other side of the room. Naruto finally got to see his prize at it's best, and with an accepting look he grinned at how wet she was. Her pussy lips were slightly swollen from all of the teasing to her body he had done, and she was flushed red from a mini-orgasm she had earlier without really noticing. Nothing big enough to cause a scream of pleasure, maybe around the same level as an orgasm gotten from foreplay.\n\n\"Then just relax, don't tense up or this will hurt a lot more than it should.\" Naruto said as he stoop up and got onto his feet so that he could re move his own boxers and let his cock spring free with a sigh of relief... that had actually been starting to hurt keeping it covered up the entire time so far. Asia blushed and covered her eyes from the sight of his cock... and while not the biggest dick around Naruto could boast about being well endowed for a guy that wasn't done growing. He was proud of it, and it wasn't like he was very small. He was just a little smaller than the average adult human, which was something that pointed to him being well endowed when he finished growing... or when he wanted to just say screw it an give himself a bigger cock for bragging rights. He could literally change any aspect about his body he wanted, so giving himself a bigger cock was a snap for him. He just didn't want to without having a real reason. He was proud of the 4 and a half inches of penic sticking up proudly from her groin.\n\nThat, and his body was small, a giant penis would look stupid on him.\n\n\"It's okay Asia, I promide that it doesn't hurt as much as you think. Onee-sama told me she girl's in their teens that had already started puberty don't get hurt as much during their first time. I will be as gentle as I can nya.\" Naruto said as he got back on top of her and positioned both of them so that she wouldn't get hurt nearly as much. Naruto placed her hand at her vagina and sent her a small non-verbal signal to keep her pussy lips open for him to go into with his length. She nodded and kept herself open, and if not for his positioning Naruto would have seen just how pink the inside of her body was to match the color of her slightly red nipples from his earlier attention. Naruto leaned his whole body forward and the head of his penic was met with resistance, a a soft and very wet resistance. Naruto felt himself actually have trouble getting it to go in with how he would just... slip out. He groaned in annoyance before hsi own hand went down to grab his cock and direct to with a steady hand to Asia's womanhood.\n\nShe tensed... Naruto noticed this, and stopped when just the head of his penis was inside of her body. She was shivering at the unfelt pleasure coursing through her like lightning. She was both tense and loose at the same time when her body almost melted like jelly when he probed her some more to try and get her to loosen up and see that it was safe for her. She nodded lightly and tried to think of the most relaxing thoughts that would get her more comfy with having her hymen ripped when she lost her virginity. Thoughts of her and Naruto in the future with a young son with her blonde hair, and his yellow eyes appeared in her mind. In her own mind she was a bit more mature, and she had a small bump in the stomach of her robes showing that she was pregnant with another child even in her imagination. The two of them were watching their son play around with two blonde cat ears and a cat tail coming out of his head, before she smiled in the real world. The next thing she used to relax her was the image of Naruto's smile... no, she opened her eyes and looked at him smiling down at her in the real world. Her imagination could nevr comnpare to the real thing, and even the imagination of what their future could be was nothing compared to that smile of his that was filled with love and desire for her.\n\nShe relaxed, so wasting no time Naruto pushed forward with a small fraction of his bodies physcial ability... he promised he wouldn't hurt her. He had super strength and durability, so if he wasn't careful he could really hurt her with his body.\n\n\"Ah! Ow ow ow, that stings a bit.\" Asia said with a moan, and not one of pleasure when she felt the stinging in her lower body from getting pierced. Naruto himself winced when he felt her blood on his body, knowing that it was him that hurt her and shed this blood from her body. Of course, when compared to what she went through in the fight this was NOTHING. Asia quickly got used to the small amount of pain... because getting a hand shoved through yours chest hurt a hell of a lot more than getting a penis in your vagina. She could already start to feel the pain fading away and giving way to a good amount of pleasure as her unused insides were stretched for the first time in her life.\n\n\"You better?\" Naruto asked, knowing that communication was important in sex. That, and she was tight... REALLY tight. The inside of Asia's vagine was something that far surpassed his own hand. Asia was warm, and she the folds inside of her were massaging his cock with their tight and moist feel. He had to admit, that if he wasn't controlling himself he would have cum early inside her just from entering. Though, because he was relaxed he was able to hold back his own natural response to being satisfied.\n\n\"Yeah... you can go now. It doesn't hurt... in fact... I like this. I think this feels REALLY-!?\" Asia said when Naruto pulled out slightly, before he sank into her folds again. She didn't even get to finish her sentence before she saw stars fill her vision when the most powerful jolt of pleasure she had ever felt filled her to the brim. Naruto on the other hand grunted lightly and made his move to start teasing Asia's breast with his mouth while his hands went to her hips and started to grind the two of them together in an attempt to time his thrusts into her with the grinding motion.\n\nHe just wanted her to cum first, because being a virgin himself, he didn't know his own sexual limits. If she came first, then he would be able to allow himself to cum as well. He could already tell that with the few thrusts he had managed to time just right with his grinding and nipple sucking that Asia was being pushed... or at least he hoped that he was timing his thrusts right. He couldn't exactly judge sexual reaction very well without experience, BUT what Naruto could tell was that Asia was feeling happy. His contact with her showed him that she was feeling more happy than he had ever felt her feel.\n\n\"Asia-chan... how close are you... to cumming nya?\" Naruto asked with a bit of stress to his voice from the effort of trying not to bite down on her nipple and ruin everything he had worked for by causing her pain and making him start all over. He could already feel her started to tense up around his cock as more fluid splashed againsgt their thighs from their activities.\n\n\"To doing... what?\" Asia asked when she heard the new term, before she shivered when another amazing jolt of pleasure filled her and she felt a knot begin to form in her lower gut. She used her hands, while being careful with her left hand, and grabbed Naruto's head and pulled him up for a rather sloppy kiss that was the first one she started since this thing began. The reaosn she wanted to kiss now was because she could feel moaned start to come from her throat, and she wanted to share the pleasure with Naruto. Naruto fo course had to take his hands from her wiats and placed them on the bed to steady himself before he quickly started to push in and out of her with a ferver.\n\n'She is cumming, what a relief!' Naruto thought with a thought of relief Asia tightened up to an almost painful level as a small amount of fluid splashed against his leg with more force than before. With that done, he allowed himself to cum as well with a sigh of joy when he emptied himself out inside of Asia. Naruto finished coming about a second later as he rolled off of Asia and layed next to her with both of them sweating a little bit, Asia more than him. Naruto himself gave his now soft cock a pat for a job well done when he looked at Asia and saw that she was trying to get her head on straight after her first major orgasm. Naruto felt his pride go up when he saw a small trickle of his cum coming from her vagina and hitting the bed. The two of them were slightly out of breath, and Asia rolled so that her hand was on his chest as she looked at him with satsifaction in her eyes.\n\n\"We need to do that again sometime.\" Asia whispered to him with a graceful smile on her face, and he nodded in agreement. That was something amazing, and they would gain more and more experience together and increase both of their sexual stamina... fighting stamina doesn't exactly go into the same thing as sexual stamina so now Naruto and Asia both would need to start training their sex skills with each other. Now that they had sex, they were going to want to have it again when they had the chance to do it without anyone catching them.\n\nThey had JUST lost their virginity after all, they didn't need to be getting into kinky stuff before Asia was ready for it.\n\nNaruto sighed in relief and the two of them drifted off to sleep together.\n\nThey could deal with everyone tomorrow, because tonight they were going to enjoy each others company.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Plenty Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t43. Chapter 43 when the cats are away\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nYuuto Kiba was a proud Knight of hte Gremory. He was the current possessor of the Sword Birth Sacred Gear, and had a great amount of skill wielding his swords. He was one of the few people that could be considered a real sword master in Rias' peerage, and he was the one male that was almost as close to Naruto and Rias as Gasper. He possessed speed that made him the second fastest person in Rias' peerage right after Naruto, but as the most powerful member of the peerage he didn't expect for Naruto to be slower than he was. He would admit that he thought of himself as handsome... not right now though.\n\nIt was a simple job really, kill the Stray Devil that had killed his master and return to Rias with proof that he had killed the devil that had killed his master and gone insane. It was something that he had done a few times before with Naruto or Koneko, sometimes even Akeno when she was feeling like it. He had never gone to fight a Stray Devil on his own, and the last few he had fought were so weak that he hadn't even needed his friends help to defeat the Stray Devil. It was a simple kill and report mission that was suppose to end with him coming back to Rias with the honor of a kill that didn't involve him needing any help, even if he had been the last person to enter the peerage after Gasper... before the Pawns came along that is.\n\nYet, right now Yuuto was running away from a shadow that was chasing him through the woods surrounding the city. Yuuto was currently holding his shoulder in pain as he ran away with blood seeping through his uniform. He ducked behind a tree as quickly as he could as the shadow passed by him with large footsteps being heard growing softer as the creature that had once been a devil tried to find him. Yuuto winced as he took his hand from her bleeding shoulder, before he grabbed something white sticking out of his shoulder and yanked on it hard enough to completely rip the seven inch long... fang out of his shoulder with a grunt of pain. He quickly ripped the sleeve of his uniform off and started to use it as a make-shift bandage to stop the bleeding from going any further. This was suppose to be an easy mission, locate the Stray Devil and kill it... but he hadn't even seen it coming before he got a fang through the shoulder. He had been able to run away, but when he started to use his swords to try and slow down the creature he had learned that the monster had some sort of hard shell protecting it from magical attacks and cutting damage from swords.\n\n'I coudn't even get a clear look at it... I need to call for help. This is to much for me to handle.' Yuuto thought as he pulled his phone from his pocket with his free hand, and he was about to press the button so that he could call somebody that always picked up his phone when he was called. Yuuto heard the phone connecting to the person he was trying to call, before his eyes widened when he heard the almost never used voicemail of his good friend Naruto. Looking at his phone with grit teeth, mostly from the pain in his shoulder, he started to manually dial Rias in the hopes that she would pick up and send him some help, or come herself and use her power to defeat this creature. He started to tap his foot on the ground as he forced himself to stand up and staryted to run in some direction to make it harder for the creature to find him.\n\n_Yuuto? Do you know what time it is!? You were suppose to be finished with the Stray Devil hours ago and back here. Are you in trouble?_\n\n\"A lot of trouble, please send help. I can't take this monster on without help, my swords aren't doing any good. It has a hard shell and is resistant to magic, and I have already been wounded. I can't get in contact with Naruto, and I have no clue what I am fighting against.\" Yuuto explained the situation with a very big wince when he bumped into a tree with his shoulder and let out a cry of pain with blood getting on the tree that he bumped into. Yuuto jumped up into the tree and hid behind one of the larger coveed areas filled with leaves just as the shadow started to move passed him and onto to another area with a loud hissing sound following him.\n\n_Trouble huh? I did just get a report, apparently the Stray Devil Halgor has the Sacred Gear Animal Blessing. It is a Sacred Gear that allows the user to take animals into their body and fuse with them. Where are you? I can't sense you anywhere in the city._\n\n\"Halgor's fang poisoned me, and my magic is being suppressed. I am in the Northern woods near the mountains. I was able to get this far before it caught up with me again. Yeah, I am a sitting duck right now. I will try to lure it as far away from the city as I can, but I need backup Asap.\" Yuuto whispered out urgently when he felt the poison in his body make his body throb again. Yeah, he should have made sure to bring some sort of backup before now, but he wanted to get stronger so instead of bringing Koneko along he decided to try and do it alone so that he could grow stronger. If he didn't push himself, then he would be growing weaker than the thing he was trying to destroy. He needed to keep growing stronger and stronger.\n\n_Damnit, okay, I will be there with Gasper and Akeno as soon as I can. Try not to get hurt anymore until then. Koneko was already tracking you, so hopefully she will find you and help you out._\n\n\"Something wrong, you sound annoyed by something else?\" Yuuto asked in an attempt to think of a plan to get himself out of danger and land a finishing blow on this creature sooner.\n\n_Another Stray Devil has appeared and Blaze is taking Kalawarner, Murayama, and Katase with him to go take care of it. Akeno just tried to call Naruto, and he isn't picking up. We think something strange is happening-bzzzzzzzt_\n\n\"Damnit, this isn't good.\" Yuuto muttered to himself as he jumped out of the tree when the shadow of creature crashed into the tree and sent it flying before it started to chase after the running Yuuto again. Said blond looked like he would rather be anywhere but here, and he had a good reason when he finally had a good view of the creature standing way more than a head over him.\n\nHalgor was a giant spider-like creature that was mostly black in color, and the spider section of his body included the eight legs and the hard spider shell with blood red fur standing out in some places on the shell like the legs and the bottom of the spider body. This part of the body was easily eleven feet tall with at the end of each spider leg was something he would rather not have seen, because at the end of each leg were large human-like hands with talons on them for fingernails. The same black armor covered the hands, on on top of each hand was the red symbol of a shark head. Instead of a spider head though like one would expect, there was a very long armor plated neck that was snake in nature, but at the end of the easily 13 foot long snake neck was the large head of a human looking black armor platet head. The head was bald, and it had eight eyes and a very wide mouth with rows and rows of human teeth. The jaws were unhinged so wide that the mouth was open in an unreal fashion.\n\n\"Food! Stronger! Food! Stronger! FOOD!\" The demented ex-devil shouted out as he charged towards Yuuto again and he looked fully intent on making Yuuto his next meal. Yuuto summoned a sword, before he winced in pain at the effort it took for him to even use enough magic for him to summon one sword. Yuuto jumped out of the way and tried to slash out one of the eyes of the spider-like creature that was once Halgor, before one of the strange hands smacked him right out of the air and into a tree with a large cut appearing on Yuuto's chest from the talon.\n\n\"Crap... double crap.\" Yuuto said a second time when he noticed that his sword was under the fast creature's body. Halgor was once a Knight, so it only made sense that he kept his Knight speed and had the ability to match Yuuto in a contect of speed and ability to react. He could run after his sword and get eaten, or he could run in the other direction and stall for time... running it is. He could always make more swords when his magic wasn't being supressed, so running away was his best option at the moment.\n\n\"Food, food, food!\" Halgor shouted towards Yuuto as he chased after the smaller creature. Yuuto rolled under a bush for a brief moment, before he started to roll behind a tree where he stood himself up and began to run away from Halgor so that he was heading towards the sword he dropped. Grabbing the sword even as he was running, Yuuto saw the Halgor was still running in the other direction... showing that his eyesight had take a major hit when he abused his Sacred Gear and went so insane that he completely fused with other animals.\n\n\"Who the hell is yelling 'food' over and over again!?\" A voice called out from the woods not very far away, and Yuuto was about to shout at them to run away before a very large figure walked through the woods with an even larger boulder being carried over her head. Yuuto sweat dropped when he saw what was perhaps the biggest woman he had ever known, before he sweat dropped even more when he saw that a thin for her height woman was holding a boulder over her head withg a single head. That red eye and blonde hair though could only belond to one person that had that physical strength without being a devil.\n\nKyokan, the human that was part Giant and Cyclops.\n\n'Finally, somebody that can help me.' Yuuto thought in relief at seeing the super strong woman walking towards him with a confused look on her face.\n\n\"A girl goes on a training trip for a few weeks, and suddenly shit hits the fan. Normally these stray devil things are dealt with by you devils or Blaze... wow that is one fugly ucker... I know what I said.\" Kyokan said when Yuuto looked like he was going to correct her for saying fugly ucker instead of ugly fucker. She knew what she said, and she wasn't one to say cursewords unless she felt like saying them... and she didn't feel like saying them right now. Yuuto was still sighing in relief that a person with brute force came out of nowhere.\n\n\"... Big food?\" Halgor stated in a questioning tone, before Kyokan's singular eye twitched at being called big from somebody other the Naruto, who made a lot of people look big in comparison.\n\n\"You mind?\" Kyokan hinted as she pointed to the stray devil with her thumb, and Yuuto collapsed on his ass with a nod of his head.\n\n\"Go ahead, I am just going to rest for a moment.\" Yuuto said as he used his good hand to keep his body propped up, and Kyokan nodded and threw her boulder so hard that Halgor had to jumped into the air to avoid getting his by the oversized stone. Yuuto sweat dropped at the easily Rook level strength this mostly human girl possessed in her body. Kyokan cracked her neck, before she started to crack her knuckled and looked at the devil with her red eye glowing brightly in the moon light. Halgor clicked and hissed towards Kyokan and started to run at her quickly, before Kyokan just back handed the first hand that was going to collide with her so hard that it veered off course and slammed into the dirt, huge cracks all over the black armor covering the spider's armor. Halgor opened his mouth and tried to swallow her whole from above, but she grabbed a fang from his top row of teeth and lower row to hold him away from her with steady eyes. Kyokan shivered in disgust when slobber landed all over her body, before she gasped.\n\nHer clothes that were hit by the saliva were starting to get disolved.\n\n\"Oh HELL no you did NOT just ruin these clothes!? Do you know how hard it is to shop in my size!?\" Kyokan shouted in an almost comical rage as she yanked the creature's head to the side and forced the monster to roll over on his back. Halgor recoiled and squirmed around with his legs up in the air, before they all dislocated and the handed pressed against the ground and made the large bodied ex-man jump into the airt and spin around before landing back on it's feet. Kyokan was sweating lightly at the groos display, before she looked at Yuuto while pointing towards Halgor with a shaking finger. \"That was gross... did you know it could do that?\" Kyokan asked as she used her non-pointing hand and overed her left breast to keep her nipple from being seen.\n\n\"I did not... and I wish I had not seen that.\" Yuuto agreed with a pale face at the gross display of something that nobody wanted to see a spider do. Kyokan grabbed Yuuto in less than a second and jumped out of the way when five clawed and armored hands swiped at them qith a great amount of speed to them. Kyokan winced when a large scratch appeared on her arm when one of the arms moved in front of her, showing that this creature was much faster than she was, but the stratch wasn't very deep. \"Be careful, this thing leaks poison that cancels magic power.\" Yuuto warned the girl with a concerned look, before she looked at him like he was stupid.\n\n\"I don't fight with magic, not to mention that-\" Kyokan started, before they both noticed when the entire creature started to morph and mutate as it grew bigger. The head of the creature became more spider-like, and the neck shrank down until it was no longer seen. Even the hands at the end of the legs started to mutate as the creature grew larger. The fingers started to shrink before they vanished into the hands and were replaced with one huge claw coming out of each leg with green... acid coming out of each of them if the disolving grass meant anything. \"... and now I am going to have a nightmare tonight, that crap was freaky.\" Kyokan admit without shame, while Yuuto stood up on his own again when the HUGE spider stared at them all from it's new height at easily 30 feet tall.\n\n\"... I wish I hadn't seen that.\" Yuuto agreed with her as the giant spider creature started to... growl down at them with it's wide human mouth. Halgor swung a mighty leg towards them, and Yuuto was about to yell at Kyokan to run away before Koneko burst from the trees and kicked the leg away from them. Koneko landed on the ground in front of the two of them, and turning to see Kyokan's reaction he sweat dropped when he saw her blushing lightly when she looked at the cute little girl, the same reaction that she had when looking at Naruto apparently.\n\n\"Yuuto... you idiot.\" Koneko stated when she looked at the giant spider with a raised eyebrow, something like this should have been as easy as cake to deal with for a blade user like Yuuto.\n\n\"It is resistant to blades and magic...\" Yuuto deadpaned when he realized that she was talking about the fact that she was refering to the fact that he went after a Stray Devil himself. He palmed his face, before he sighed and nodded. He fully expected Rias to get a little mad at him for doing this, but he had to wonder where Naruto was. He was about to ask Koneko, before one of the lightning fast strikes from the creatures legs knocked Koneko clear through the air as she knocked into several trees and made them fall over onto her, completely covering Koneko in a bundle of trees. \"... and you are to slow to do anything either. Just great.\" Yuuto said with a palm to his face, before Koneko burst out of the trees and landed on her feet... the only visible injury on her body being the fact that her skirt had been ripped away by some of the trees and her top being scratched up.\n\n\"Bear panties... so cute.\" Kyokan said with a dreamy smile on her face. She couldn't pull on bear panties because of her size making them look strange on her, but they looked amazing on Koneko.\n\n\"Shut it perv-skirt.\" Koneko said with a twitching eyebrow at how her outfit was ruined... AGAIN! It was like every single time she fought against a Stray Devil her clothes got ruined beyond being repaired. She went through so many pairs of clothes just by fighting strays that her closet was filled with the exact same outfit. For once she would like to kill a stray devil and not have to be teleported home because she was almost naked.\n\n\"FOOD!\" Halgor shouted out, before the next thing the spider knew what pain when Koneko jumped towards the creature as hard as she could, before she kicked the monster in the middle of the body... before the creature exploded and she came bursting from the other side with a disgusted look on her face when she saw that she was covered in the blue guts of the creature she had just killed without mercy.\n\n\"Is it wrong to be more scared of a loli than it is to be scared of a giant spider?\" Kyokan asked with a shaky finger towards the pissed off Koneko, before she noticed the Yuuto was nodding and making sure to look away from Kyokan... who was now almost completely naked from her clothes melting off. Kyokan's eye widened, before she covered herself up and started to run away as fast as she could out of the forest.\n\n\"Gross to the max.\" Koneko said as she started to try and get the ooze off of her body. Seriously, why was it always her that got covered in slime or had her clothes ripped off of her body!? Did somebody have something against her and wearing her clothes?! Koneko sighed, before she picked Yuuto over and placed him over her shoulder, before she started to carry him on the slow way all the way back towards the club room. Yuuto would need to get his shoulder treated, and then he would be lectured for not calling for help sooner by Rias no doubt.\n\nShe wondered what Naruto was doing right now.\n\nOn second thought, it would be better if she didn't know.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t44. Chapter 44 Ravel's Determination\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Sex will be a rather rare thing, but it will be mentioned in passing. Not every chapter will have it, but the story won't be without it either. **_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'I can't believe I let my temper and arrogance get to me. Ruval always taught me to never underestimate my opponents, and I treated the nun like a lesser being.' Ravel thought as she started to grip her fist in frustration over the fact that she had let her anger get the better of her and cost her the match. If she had just kept a calm head, then she would have been able to use her brain in the battle and outsmart the girl. Ravel knew that she had made a mistake of starting the match with anger, and not planning ahead like she usually did when she was confronted with a fight. Normally she would have tried to end the nun as quickly and painfully as possible, and give her no chance to counter. She had made the mistake of playing with her opponent though, and she should have considered the fact that a Nun would have a cross and Holy Water. She may not have used the cross against her directly, but the entire match Ravel didn't feel like she was at full power when she got too close to the girl that had stolen what was rightfully hers.\n\nThere were other factors she only recently learned about that contibuted to her own defeat.\n\nThe first was that the nun was the possessor of the Unique level Sacred Gear called the Twilight Healing, which granted the user to heal wounds almost of par with the Phenex ability to regenerate from damage. If she had just burnt Asia to a crisp as soon as possible, then she wouldn't have been able to heal herself before being defeated. She shouldn't have given the girl the chance to get healed period, but she did and that was her very first fatal error in the battle. She gave the opponent time to get better and make a plan of their own.\n\nThe second mistake she made was thinking that the girl didn't have the magic reserves to last very long, or the physical endurance. She should have known better than to just assume that the enemy couldn't use magic, or at least didn't have sizable magical reserves. She had to confirm this with one of the servants with sensing abilities, but she had learned that the nun had a way larger than average magical power for a human. The girl had reserves that would naturally put her around a Dame Rank, the first Middle-Class rank or female devils. Most humans had very tiny, if not non-existant reserves of magic, meaning that her mistake was slightly understandable. The girl was also in good physical condition, meaning that she had lived a very active lifestyle, so her physical stamina wasn't something to laugh at either. Ravel had much more stamina, but this Asia girl had more than enough to use the third mistake that Ravel had made.\n\nThe third mistake, the fact that she hadn't realized that the girl had been in possession of the Boosted Gear. She hadn't immediantly recongnized it during the fight, but she should have. The longer you fight somebody with that Sacred Gear, the more powerful they become. The ability to double your power every ten seconds was a formidable ability for anyone with the magical energy or physical energy to fuel it long enough for it to make a big impact. Not all was known about the Boosted Gear, other than the fact that the Welsh Dragon was sealed inside of it so that it granted it's power to the user... power than can kill a god if used correctly and with enough training. For a normal human, using the Boosted Gear even a few times would be more than they could handle.\n\nAsia wasn't a normal human though, from what her brother's familiar had heard this Asia girl had spent her entire life using and perfecting her use of the Twilight Healing so that she could heal the most damage with the least amount of energy needed. The girl's control over her energy was evenj greater than Ravel's cojntrol over her own power, which made this girl a natural at using her magical power as a way to fuel both her Sacred Gear's at the same time in ways that most wouldn't think of. That would mean that she could use her Sacred Gear's to an amazing degree out on instinct alone with her perfect magic control, and if the girl was ever taught about how to use actual magic she would become an even more powerful force to be messed with. She could already use the Longinus level Sacred Gear like she had been doing it her whole life, showing that she had a natural understanding on how to use a Sacred Gear... that or she had a very high affinity for Dragon's and other things related to Dragon's.\n\nHer fourth mistake was possible her most important for her to learn from was the fact that she had gone into the fight angry. She had been furious at this girl for ruining what should have been the greatest day of her life, and that had affected her ability to think and plan clearly from the very beginning. She should have been able to think of a plan and kill Asia without any trouble, even if the girl had a Longinus, but she had been angry and only wanted to cause as much pain as possible before slowly killing the girl. She had dragged the fight on when she could have just used a fireball from the very beginning to roast the girl, but she didn't do that, she allowed the girl to keep on gaining power as the fight went on.\n\nHer final mistake, assuming that she had won when she had pierced the girl through the chest with her Nova Burner, and attack that consumed a lot of her own power to use. She should have hit Asia in the head with a fireball to make sure that the girl was dead, but she turned her back on the foe and made an ass of herself because of her arrogance in believing that her ultimate close-range attack couldn't be beaten by a human, even one with healing powers. She had underestimated the healing skill the girl had, and the fact that she could endure a lot of pain... of course, she would have to make sure to train even harder than before so that she could get back at Asia.\n\nOf course, just because she lost, did NOT mean that she had any plans to allow HER Naruto-kun to stay with a human. She had planned for years how to get him, so just because her first plan failed didn't mean that she wasn't going to use one of her back-up plans to make sure that she got him. She wasn't some weak willed fool that would give up such a fine piece of man just because she lost a single fight against an opponent that she should have beaten. Ravel Phenex was going to just have to try and try until she succeeded, and then when she did she would rub this Asia girl's nose in it that she still married Naruto in the end. It didn't matter if Naruto was already married or not, almost every male in her family had a harem, so she _could_ share, but with who she shared was another story completely.\n\nThough, now she could add another goal to her list of things she wanted to do.\n\n_1. Marry Naruto_  \n_2. Beat Asia in a fight_  \n_3. Get traded to her mother_  \n_4. Become a member of Naruto's peerage when he gains his Evil Piece set through a trade_  \n_5. Gain her own Evil Piece set._  \n_6. Convince Naruto to start his own House and gain the Ultimate Rank_\n\nShe had it alled planned out, so with a grin Ravel stood up from her bed and went over to the mirror in her room and started to look at her face to make sure that she had healed from the Holy Water without so much as a trace of the burn that she had gotten. Ravel smiled when she saw her flawless features were once again... flawless. Now all she needed to do is get Naruto to fall in love with her and she would be able to have children that were absolutely flawless. She cracked her neck slightly, before she started to chuckle darkly.\n\n\"Naruto-kun... you will be mine. You better watch your back Nun, because I will be back.\" Ravel stated with an evil chuckle.\n\n_**-With Naruto and Asia-**_\n\n\"Achoo!\" Naruto sneezed as his body tensed and he ended up losing control of himself and cumming inside Asia seconds before she herself came. Asia rolled off from Naruto with sweat dripping from her face, before she grabbed a marker from the drawer next to her side of the bed and used a dry erase board on the drawer to make a mark. She smiled lightly even thoughs he looked amazingly winded from the large amount of sex the two had been having since they woke back up from their first time. Asia saw that Naruto himself was panting like crazy from trying to keep up with the large amount of sex... this was a combination of their ideas.\n\nAsia had wanted to go another round because she had been told this was a physical show of love between a man and a woman, so she wanted to feel that love more while they had the chance. Naruto had decided to make it a little game though, each time they had sex they would compare their own sexual stamina's against each other and keep score with dry erase boards and markers. The one that came first would be the loser of that round and was forced to be on bottom the next time they had sex, while the winner would be the dominant one during sex and decide if they wanted to go another round or not. This was a little way to make it so that it was both fun, and a form of endurance training for the two of them.\n\nNaruto was silently cursing at the fact that somebody had been talking about him, making him sneeze and lose his focus and the game. Naruto pouted when he looked at the scores, before he became determined to gain the lead again.\n\n\"How about... we take... a break?\" Asia suggested between pants, while Naruto nodded with a wince. He couldn't even go another round if he wanted to, he was completely tapped out of sperm and the desire to have sex at the moment. Naruto looked at his own scoreboard again with a twitching eye, knowing that it would be a few weeks before he got the time to have sex with Asia again. The only reason he was able to even go more than one round with Asia right now was because Koneko was taking care of his business with Rias at the moment. He had a feeling that she wasn't going to be doing that again anytime soon, so he wanted to savour Asia while he had the time too.\n\n\"Yeah, I think I have some missed calls nya.\" Naruto said as he got out of the bed and moved over to the dresser where his phone was, before he tapped a button and sweat dropped when he realized that he had missed calls from both Yuuto and Akeno. Deciding that he would deal with them tomorrow, when he wasn't completely exhausted, he went back to the bed with Asia and smiled as he closed the distance between them and started to cuddle with her. Asia was the kind of person that liked to be in close, she was very much a lover of cuddling right after sex. Not that he was against it.\n\n\"We aren't going to be able to do this for awhile are we?\" Asia asked when she managed to regain her breath, but she still looked exhausted. Naruto nodded with a grimace at how she was right on the money, it would be at least a week or two before they got the chance to be intimate again.\n\n\"I might not have the time, but sex isn't everything.\" Naruto said with a slight shrug, even though he was pretty annoyed with himself for costing himself the lead. Asia smiled and sank into his embrace with a content sigh, knowing that today was a safe day was the biggest reason why she wanted to get all the sex out of her system. So that she could go awhile without feeling the need to have it now that she had a taste of the good stuff. The two were already making plans to move Asia into Naruto's room with him, and get Naruto a larger bed to fit the two of them together.\n\n\"The game is a little fun though... so I guess I get to be on top again next time.\" Asia said with a small smile when she looked over to her scoreboard and saw the number 3 on it the name Asia right above it. Then she looked over at Naruto's board and saw the number 2 on it under his name. They were pretty much even when it came to how long they could last, and normally the margin between them ranged between a few seconds before the other came, with Naruto lasting a full minute on his second victory before he completed.\n\n\"Yeah yeah, you got lucky. I am going to win next time and even the score. So, when do you want to start your training?\" Naruto asked with a small questioning tone at the fact that sia would need to start training so that she could defend herself now that it was known that she had the Boosted Gear. She might not like it, but people were going to target her now. Asia admitted that she would defend herself if she was attacked, but that didn't mean she would have to hurt others. She was more of a healing type than an offence type, while Naruto knew it was more about finding what she was willing to fight for. Now that she had the Boosted Gear, both her support, healing, and offencive skills were going to go through the roof, so Naruto wanted to make sure she was well enough trained so that she could do better than she did against Ravel should she ever fight somebody else after one of their heads. Asia had won against Ravel against all odds, and Naruto seriously doubt that she could do it again if Ravel was fighting with a level head. That was why she NEEDED to learn self-defence so that she could defend herself long enough to escape or boost enough to go on the offence.\n\n\"I don't want to fight again, but training sounds... nice?\" Asia said after a moment, and Naruto sat up with a smile on his face and nodded to her.\n\n\"It is really fun. When you train you get stronger, and even if you don't want to fight you can work out whatever is frustrating you with hard training. I have been able to work out all my problems for years by training. Whenever Rias or somebody annoyed me, or I was just angry at nothing I would train until I dropped.\" Naruto explained with a smile on his face, because it was his training that had kept him sane all these years. He could put up with a lot of stuff because he would just train out his issues, something that made him feel much better in the end than just bottling them up until they exploded.\n\nAsia just smiled and nodded as she listened to Naruto go on and on about the methods of training, from physical training all the way to training in magic and the other mystical arts like magic. Asia had to admit that learning magic sounded like it would be fun for her to try. She would have to talk to somebody else about it though, because Naruto had already admit to her that he sucked at using magic. He was more of the Youjutsu kind of person, and you needed to actually be a Youkai to learn how to do Youjutsu. She would be able to learn the same magic as Devils though, because humans have been learning how to do Devil magic for centuries. She smiled at the idea of becoming a Magician.\n\n'Akeno is going to have a field day with all of the Princess and Knight jokes... damnit Onee-sama, you just had to make that kind of joke with Akeno in the room... oh well. It isn't like I wasn't alreadu used to being called a Queen, so Akeno making Princess jokes won't be too bad.' Naruto thought to himself as he mentally prepared himself for tomorrow when he would have to do back to the rest of the club. He was sure that Akeno would make plenty of jokes about Asia being Naruto's knight, and him being her princess. That didn't really bother him that much, his title was Queen after all, and in a way Asia was his Knight.\n\n\"I am glad that I met you Naruto-kun.\" Asia said out on nowhere, while Naruto blinked in confusion when she knocked him from his thoughts.\n\n\"I'm glad I met you too Asia-chan.\" Naruto stated right back at her truthfully, and she nodded happily when he responded to her like she wanted him to.\n\nShe couldn't imagine herself anywhere but at his side at this point.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**The Excalibur Sword ARC starts next chapter.**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t45. Chapter 45 Prolouge to Excalibur Arc\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\nA red magic circle appeared in the middle of a room, and second laters red dust came out of the circle and collected together as Naruto himself took shape from the circle. With his hands in his pockets, Naruto looked to who summoned him with a raised eyebrow to see that it was one of the people from the group that had brought Asia to the wedding to crash it and free him from the agreement.\n\nArthur Pendragon, one of the descendents of the first Arthur Pendragon.\n\n'This was not what I expected to happen when I was summoned.' Naruto thought with a twitching eyebrow, before he heard the sound of a blade being plunged into the ground. Naruto jumped in shock when he saw that Arthur had stuck his own sword into the ground and was looking at Naruto with an expectant look on his face. Naruto looked down at the sword in the ground and saw that it was styled like an older European sword with a golden handle and a shining silver blade. In the guard of the sword was a red gem with a black magic circle incripted on the inside of it. The outlines of the silver part of the blade had gold lining them, and overall the sword just gave off any amazingly 'Holy' aura to it.\n\n\"Naruto Uzumaki, the chosen of Ophis the Dragon-God of Infinity.\" Arthur stated with a look towards Naruto, while Naruto himself gulped lightly when he noticed the ruined state of the place he had been summoned. It would seem that he had been summoned to the middle of the very same Church that he had been in when he slayed Raynare. Naruto looked at Arthur with steel in his eyes, before he summoned two bubbles in his hands. Blue flames started to appear on the inside of the bubbles, before Arthur held his hand up to stop Naruto from going on with a small peace gesture. \"Naruto Uzumaki, I mean no harm. I only seak to have a request of mine sated, and by summoning you I both fufill that request and further the goals of my group.\" Arthur stated, and with a wave of his hand he pointed towards the sword stuck in the ground.\n\n\"Goals... I have to admit that you have this cat curious nya.\" Naruto stated as he deformed his own bubbles safely and stood up in a slightly relaxed stance. He would hear this guy out for the time being, but one hostile action would set Naruto off.\n\n\"I have summoned you so that you will become my opponent.\" Arthur started out while moving his glasses up his nose. He looked at Naruto with eyes that almost gleamed with the lust for battle, before Naruto's eyes narrowed. \"Of course, you aren't ready yet. This Request is a three part request before I battle against you. First, I want you to draw and swing this sword. This is the Strongest Excalibur Fragment, Excalibur Ruler, so if you can draw it even as a devil and swing it then you will have completed the first part.\" Arthur stated with an airy wave at the fact that he was giving away the strongest fragment of the broken Excalibur sword. Just because somebody was a devil, doesn't mean that they are unable to wield an Excalibur level sword with a Holy attribute. Only natural born devils would be destroyed when they tried to use a Holy sword of this level. A fake Devil like Naruto should be able to use this sword, so long as he had the right qualities that the sword needed before being wielded.\n\n\"What about the second and third part?\" Naruto asked with crossed arms as he sent a wary glance towards the fragment. Arthur frowned lightly for a moment, before he gestured to the sword first.\n\n\"If you can't draw the sword, then the second and third parts won't matter now will they. If you can draw the sword then I will inform you of the second and third part, but if you can't then you fail and I will take my leave.\" Arthur said almost insistantly, while Naruto looked at the sword stuck in the ground with narrowed eyes. Somebody didn't just give away a sword of that power with no reason, but if Naruto could draw this sword then it was pretty much as good as his apparently.\n\n\"Humor me, if I draw the sword what do I have to do after that nya?\" Naruto asked while rolling his eyes, Arthur rubbed the bridge of his nose, before he saw that Naruto wasn't going to relent.\n\n\"Okay. If you manage to draw the sword, then the second part of the agreement will be for you to restore this Church to it's former glory. The third part will be the hardest though, because you will need to reforge the original Excalibur using all seven Fragments.\" Arthur explained with a small amount of annoyance at how sceptical Naruto was over the fact he was giving him a sword if he could draw it. How hard was it to believe that Arthur wanted somebody to wield the true Excalibur against him so that he could have a worthy foe? This not only managed to complete his personal goal, but Ophis herself was interested in setting forth challenges that would make Naruto grow stronger and stronger. Ophis stated that at the height of Naruto's power in his first life he had the raw ability, guts, and battle skills to go up against the Great Red and win. The man had pretty much slain a Primordial God and sealed it inside him, as well as slaying two people that were able to defeat a Primordial as well. His power had grown so great that he just couldn't take it anymore and his owjn power killed his human body, so Ophis retrieved the pieces of his soul over long periods of time and pieced him back together so that he could be given a non-human body that could one day contain the power that Naruto had achieved.\n\nOphis wanted Naruto to reach a higher state of power than his last life, so she gave him a chance with a body that could take the power without exploding.\n\nWhile Arthur found it hard to believe that anyone could have that power, Ophis wasn't a person to lie or make jokes, so he believed her.\n\n\"So... I just have to draw this sword... then restore the Church... and then reforge the Seven Excalibur Fragments back into the Original Excalibur. Okay then, lets get started nya.\" Naruto said with a crack of neck as he started to walk towards the sword despite how suspicious he was over the offer. Here he was, literally being given a request that would give him one of the four most powerful weapojns forged by the God of the Bible. He would have to be a fool to say no to getting such a cool weapon for himself, and rebuilding the Church was something he had already palnned to do for Asia as a wedding gift. She was sad over the state of the Church, so he would have fixed it for her as a nice surprise.\n\n'Here is the big test.' Arthur thought neutrally as he watched Naruto placed his right palm on the handle of the fragment sword... when nothing bad happened to Naruto Arthur looked even more interested than his neutral show of face before. Naruto yanked on the sword once, and once was all it took for the sword to come out of the ground like the ground was just butter.\n\n\"That was... easy nya.\" Naruto stated with a twitching eyebrow at how simple it was to get the sword, before he looked towards Arthur to gloat... only to find that Arthur was no longer there anymore. Naruto laughed awkwardly to himself, before he scratched the back of his head at the fact that his contracter had vanished when he wasn't paying attention. He stopped scratching his head and looked around the Church to see all the damage that he would have to repair, before he nodded when he figured that all that would have to be done is get new flooring, repair the benches, and fix the cross at the end of the Church and it would be as good at new. He almost laughed at the irony of him being the person to fix up a Church, before he nodded to himself and set himself up into work mode. Deciding what to do first was easy for Naruto, so clapping his hands together he started to gather some of his Yokai into his hands for a Youjutsu.\n\nNaruto opened his hands and multiple bubbles started to shoot out of his hands and started to wrap themselves around the benches and around the cross at the end of the Church near the altar.\n\n\"Okay, so this won't be to hard... the floor will be a problem though.\" Naruto said as he channeled his large reserves into all of the bubbles in the room. Glowing orange dust started to come from the inside of the bubbles and enter the objects that they were surrounding. These were his bubbles that Naruto used to restore things, they couldn't be used on living matter, but against average things like benches they could be used to bring them back to top condition by using his Yokai as the base to make the objects seemingly regrow their lost or damaged parts, or even fix scratches and dents in things. Naruto watched as the parts of the benches were starting to get fixed up, before the cross finished itself and was back to it's complete state.\n\nThat caused a rather large wince from Naruto, who was standing mere feet away from said large cross.\n\nHe ignored the pain though as he got back to restoring the rest of the Church... he didn't know why Arthur wanted the Church restored, but he figured that it much be a pretty important part of reforging the original Excalibur.\n\nNaruto's head snapped down when a large piece of wood came from the ceiling and smashed into the top of his skull. Looking up in annoyance, Naruto was able to see that the rafters were pretty much falling apart as well. Naruto whipped out his phone and dialed Rias' number, and seconds later she picked up her phone.\n\n_Naruto? Trouble?_\n\n\"No trouble, but I may be back to the clubroom late. The Request will take a bit more time than I thought it might.\" Naruto told her simply, knowing that she would get suspicious if he came back late without warning her beforehand. It wouldn't do goof for him if anyone found out that he was reparing a Church, or that he was doing it by the request with the reward being Excalibur. Naruto walked around and tested the floor, with a few creaks as he walked he noticed that the floor was in pretty good condition other than the fact that there were a few cracks in the ground from various things he most likely didn't want to know about.\n\n_Oh, is that all. Thanks for telling me then. I will see you when you get back-boooooo_\n\n\"She hung up...\" Naruto commented dryly, before he looked around the Church and pouted when he saw that he was actually going to be here for a good amount of time before he finished up the most important parts for the night. He would most likely have to return tomorrow with supplies so that he could get the rafters and floor finished... good thing Naruto was pretty good at repairing things. All it would take was one call to Sirzechs and getting the supplies without Rias knowing would be a simple matter. He could pay Sirzechs back later once he finished up, but he was 100 percent sure that Rias wouldn't be happy with him if he fixed up a Church.\n\nHe would also have to keep his new sword a secret for now, at least until he felt Yuuto wouldn't attack or demand that he let him destroy the sword for his petty revenge. Really, Naruto understood why Yuuto blamed the swords for his problem, but they were just swords. Instruments with no will of their own, so if anything Yuuto should blame the people resposible for his troubles. It wasn't like the swords chose to exist, they were created by god, the reforged by man.\n\nNaruto looked at the Excalibur Ruler, before he sighed.\n\nThis was going to be a LOT of work.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\nList of Excalibur Swords and Wielders  \nExcalbur Ruler - Naruto  \nExcalibur Destruction - Xenovia  \nExcalibur Mimic - Irina  \nExcalibur Blessing - (Next Chapter)  \nExcalibur Nightmare - Freed  \nExcalibur Rapidly - Freed  \nExcalibur Transparency - Freed\n\n\n\t46. Chapter 46 The Trio\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Wow, for an abandoned Church this place is pretty neat.\" A young girl in her middle teen years stated as she looked on in amazement a small group of three girls entered the very same Church that a certain white haired boy was fixing up. None of the girls even noticed Naruto hanging from the rafters as he ate his lunch and looked down at them with a curious glance. Naruto was eating his lunch slowly since he didn't have anywhere to be, and Rias wasn't giving him any work now that he had a longer Request to finish. So he was able to enjoy the peace and quiet of working on repairing a Church with nobody bothering him.\n\nUntil now.\n\nRight now Naruto was looking at them with a keen eye, observing them to try and see if they were here for anything suspicious or not. It wasn't every day that three rather attractive girls went to a Church that was no longer in use, and even more so for girls that were so strangely dressed as the three under him at the moment in time. Naruto was currently trying to assess each girl and figure out their threat levels, and he was pretty sure that he had them each figured out at this point.\n\nThe first girl, the one that had been talking, but the second weakest of the bunch. This girl had long light brown hair done up in twin tails at the sides of her head, and they were held up with bright blue scrunchies that attracted attention in contrast to her hair, and her bangs were slightly parted at the right side of her face. Her eyes were a bright violet color, almost matching Akeno's actually. Her skin was a pale peach color, a little lighter than Asia's, and she wore the strangest clothes that Naruto had ever seen in his entire life... that weren't made for sex that is. She wore LITERALLY what was a black skin-tight unitard that didn't hide a single part of her body, only covering it. Her thighs were showing, and about an inch down each thigh were straps to keep her unittard from going up and giving her a wedgie... which it could. She wore thigh-high black latex stockings, and for shoes she wore black boots. Both of which had straps to keep them in place, and even her arms had long black gloves on them that covered most of her arm, leaving only a little of the skin on her arm showing... and she had a strange golden rope around her left arm. She was also around 5 feet 5 inches tall.\n\nThis girl was obviously built for speed and nothing else, with the only thing slowing her down being her rather large chest.\n\nThe second girl stuck out the most of the three because she gave off the aura of the leader, and she seemed to be the strongest of them. WIth one hand she was carrying a large bandaged sword that even grown men would have trouble handling with two hands, and he would guess that it weighed a good 100 or even 200 pounds, yet she had it lifted up with a single hand. Her hair was a very strange blue color and only went down to her chin in length, but was messier than the first girl's with a green stand in her bangs. Naruto stared down at her eyes for a moment when he saw that they were almost the same shade of dark yellow as his. The only modification to her uniform, which was the same as the other girl's, was that her unitard has short sleeves, so she was showing less skin, and she had no fingers on her long gloves. Like Asia, this girl wore a silver crucifix on her chest, right between large chest... which was the largest of the three, and a lot larger than most devils he had seen. She was the same height as her partner.\n\nThis girl was built for speed, and power... a lot of power. Naruto could feel her power, and it honestly impressed him how much hidden power this girl contained. Not magical power like with Asia either, but pure physical power hidden within a womanly body. It was like strength was brimming underneath her fair skin, and she was only a human. Her body also told him that she wasn't a style sword user, but instead the kind of sword user that abused the hell out of her power instead of using her technique.\n\nThe third girl... the weakest physically, but her magical reserves were the largest of them. No, she also seemed to have something else special about her reserves... something he had seen several times before. Sacred Gear. This girl had a Sacred Gear inside of her, but it wasn't one made for battle judging by how she felt. This girl wore the same uniform as the first, showing that maybe the second girl's uniform was different because she was the leader. The only difference was the small crystal bell that this girl had attached to the neck of her uniform. This girl had pale lavender eyes with an even paler lavender for the color of her pupils, and her very light blond hair fell down well passed her waist. She even had the end of it tied with a bow, and unlike the other girl's her bangs were neat and straight instead of uneven. The sides of her bangs went down to frame her face, coming a little passed her chin. She seemed a little shorter than the other girl's, and her chest was about a large C-cup.\n\nThis girl was not build for speed or power, and the sword attacked to a strap on her back gave off the same kind of magical feeling as the girl did. This girl was a support fighter that used some sort of magic, in combination with her sword, to boost her allies abilities. She also gave off the same aura as somebody that had some form of training when it came to sealing away demons, meaning that she was some form of Exorcist.\n\nThe speed fighter, the heavy hitting tank, and the long distance support.\n\nThey were a well balanced team that covered each others weaknesses.\n\n\"Neat isn't the word I would use, but living here will be easier if it isn't broken and covered in dust.\" The third girl stated with her arms crossed under her chest, showing that she hadn't noticed the devil in the Church... of course, just because they couldn't notice him didn't mean the same couldn't be said for Naruto as he looked down at the unique additions to their uniforms and weapons. The first girl's golden rope around her arm, and the other two's swords gave off the same Holy feeling as Naruto's new Excalibur Ruler. Naruto was starting to sweat drop when he realized the finding the other Excalibur Fragments might be a lot easier than he had thought. The blue haired girl stayed silent the entire time as she glanced around the room with a suspicious look of her own, showing that she had some sort of sixth sense that told her when somebody was around. She obviously couldn't actually sense him, but she showed a great spacial awareness of a battle trained warrior.\n\n'Excalibur Destruction... the pale eye one has Excalibur Blessing... and the only Excalibur fragment with transformation abilities is Excalibur Mimic. Why would three girls with Excalibur swords come to Kuoh?' Naruto wondered in his head as he looked down at them again, but with a more critical instead of interested eye. He was concerned about the fact that three women that were affiliated with the Church were intruding into devil territory without a care in the world. He was annoyed that he would have to do his duty as a devil and keep them under watch, and try to find out there goals. He would have heard from Rias if they had asked to be here, and had been granted her permission for entering her personal territory. This city literally belonged to the Gremory family, and was currently under Rias' control thanks to her father just letting her have it.\n\nMost girls get a car, or money for their 16th birthday... Rias got a city.\n\nShe was just that rich.\n\n\"Irina, Shion... do not forget that we are here to find the stolen Excalibur fragments then retrieve them. Comfort doesn't matter right now, and we will be out of here as soon as the mission is over. With three of the Excalibur Fragments stolen, and one missing, our Excaliburs are the only things that can defeat the stolen fragments.\" The blue haired girl stated to the two known as Irina and Shion, and while Irina pouted slightly at being told off, Shion just scowled slightly at being reminded of their mission. She would have just prefered to stay at the Church and wait for her chosen one to come and take her away, not being sent on mission after mission to country after country for the Church.\n\n\"Don't remind me of the mission Xenovia, I know full well what we are here to do. Retrieve the Excalibur Fragments if we can, destroy them all if we can't. Simple, and easy to remember. Only an idiot, or Irina, could forget something like that.\" Shion stated with a smirk when Irina nodded with her in an excited way... before she glared at Shion for calling her stupid with her words. It took her a few moments, but she had caught the underlining meaning behind the words. Naruto sighed for a moment, knowing that he should reveal himself soon in a way that didn't make himself look suspicious.\n\n...\n\n\"Hey girl's, will one of you mind handing me some nails. A guy can't restore the Church if he doesn't have nails.\" Naruto randomly commented from above while holding up his hammer to show that he was working on fixing the rafters. All three girl's jumped up out of shock, before Shion and Irina blushed in embarrassment when they saw that they had been caught off guard and that they had been scared by the boy above them. Naruto rolled his eyes, before he noticed that the one known as Xenovia was looking at himn with critical eyes.\n\n\"Sure thing, here you go!\" Irina shouted up at him as she grabbed the entire box of nails and tossed it up to him with a smile on her face. In her eyes, if this guy was working on restoring the Church then she wouldn't suspect him in the slightest. Not to mention the fact that Naruto just had the kind of presence that either annoyed you, or made you want to be his friend. He could even turn enemies into friends if he wanted to, but sometimes he just didn't want to waste his breath on some people.\n\n\"Aren't you a little too young to be using a hammer and nails to fix a Church?\" Shion asked with a small amount of snark to her voice, and Naruto's eye twitched.\n\n\"Well aren't you a ray of sunshine, and here I was about to do you a favor from one Excalibur fragment holder to another and help you find the stolen fragments, but I guess that is out of the window.\" Naruto stated with a realistic looking huff, making sure to reveal enough to get them to trust him. Xenovia stepped forward with narrowed eyes as she looked up towards him, before she remembered that he had been here long enough to hear them talking about there mission. She calmed down when she realized that it was them that informed this boy of their mission, so of course he would know about it.\n\n\"... Wait, did you just say you have an Excalibur fragment? That is impossible, of the seven Excalibur fragments, three were stolen, and we have the last three. How do you have one of them when the only one missing has been lost for centuries?\" Xenovia demanded with narrrowed eyes, before Naruto hopped down from the rafters and landed on the ground in front of the girls. With a grin, Naruto walked towards one of the restored benches and picked reach towards the seats. The girls each looked surprised when Naruto pulled none other than the Excalibur Ruler from the bench with a look on his face that said one thing, one thing that made Xenovia twitch in annoyance. He was basically telling her that she was wrong, and he was right.\n\nEach of the girls was given a very vivid explaination on what the missing swords looked like, and what the Excalibur Ruler was suppose to look like. This was not one of the swords that was suppose to have been stolen, it was the very same sword that had gone missing right after being forged.\n\n\"Holy Lord in Heaven, the lost Excalibur!?\" Irina shouted with a shocked look towards the sword, while Shion was looking away at having thought another Excalibur user was a weakling based on physical looks alone. Xenovia coughed into her hand from her own shock, before she nodded and looked at him. She was about to talk to him, before he held his hand out to stop her before she could even start.\n\n\"No, I am not giving it to you. I will help you get the other ones though.\" Naruto stated with authority in his tone, and he pointed Excalibur Ruler at them to show them that he meant business. Xenovia didn't mind one bit, before she nodded.\n\n\"I wasn't going to say that actually. This blade is rightfully yours if you are the wielder, and I have no authority to remove it from you. The other blades were stolen though, and it is our mission to get them back. Excalibur Ruler is not apart of that mission.\" Xenovia said with a lightly twitching ey at how Naruto was still sending them the look that told them that they couldn't take the blade from him even if they wanted to. They really couldn't, well, they would be a threat if they worked together, but not apart. He would destroy them if they didn't work together to try and take him down, because with the power of Destruction, the diversity or Mimic, and the support abilities and anti-devil abilities of Blessing they were real threat. One cut from a Holy sword against devils could be very draining on them, and Holy swords could negate even a Queen's defence.\n\n\"So who are you anyway, you know our names, but we don't know yours?\" Shion asked with narrowed eyes at the whiskered teen. Naruto winced for a moment when his palm jolted with pain when Shion spoke to him, before he stabbed Ruler into the ground in front of him and crossed his arms.\n\n\"I'm Toujou Naruto... Naruto Toujou.\" Naruto corrected himself before the girls thought his first name was Toujou. Sometimes it got confusing for others when he made the mistake of saying his last name first, and then his first name.\n\n\"So, why are you fixing up the Church?\" Irina asked with a small smile on her face, before her question went completely unanswered when all three girls groaned when they felt their stomachs start to act up and both Xenovia and Shion glared right at a sheepish Irina. They hadn't had any food to eat since Irina had wasted all of their money on buying a way overpriced painting, before she found out the painting was a fake and cut it up in a fit of rage to the point that they couldn't fix it and return it for a refund. They had no money for food, and their last meal was paid for by them doing street preforming with their swords, and even that money had only bought them one meal.\n\n\"Hungry?\" Naruto asked with a small smile, while Shion started to glare at him with a slight amount of embarrassment. He could see why it was embarrassing for her, most women didn't like to admit that had actual human needs like others. If a man was hungry, then that was something that made a man a man, but if a woman was hungry then she was some kind of pig that ate a lot, or a girl that starved herself. It wasn't something that Naruto agreed with, but it was how human society was run these days.\n\n\"Very, do you know where we can get a cheep meal?\" Irina asked shyly, while Naruto chuckled and nodded.\n\n\"If you are all hungry, I will pay for the meal.\" Naruto offered with a smile, before he felt a chill go down his spine when he realized that he had somehow turned into a person that couldn't resist helping his natural enemies. The VERY next thing Naruto knew was that his face was being pressed into Irina's breasts as she hugged him with almost comical tears in her eyes at how she would be able to eat a meal and not have to be the one to pay for it.\n\n\"Thank you, thank you. It must be God's divine planning that had us meeting, this is fate set force in motion by the merciful hands of the good Lord's grace!\" Irina shouted at the top of her lungs as she started to rub Naruto into her bossom with an almost erotic feel to her aura. Naruto looked up at her face to see that she was practically glowing, and even with his face in between her boobs he still managed to look at both Shion and Xenovia shaking their heads in humiliation.\n\n\"Does she do this often?\" Naruto couldn't resist the urge to ask as the most devote of the Christians in the room went off and began to ramble about God and his blessings.\n\n\"Very much so, if you learn to tune her out you can save your sanity.\" Shion blunty put it as she crosssed her arms, her face now set in a frown at how they were being mocked in some way by how Naruto was shaking his eyebrow at them.\n\n\"Once she gets going, she has trouble stopping. How old are you anyway?\" Xenovia asked after a moment, and Naruto chuckled.\n\n\"15, but I have a lot of experience fighting devils.\" Naruto said, refering to how he trained among devils and killed stray devils all the time. Technically, what he said was true, so even though he meant somethinhg else by it didn't mean that he couldn't trick these girls and see what kind of people they were. It would be best to observe them from right next to them, gain their trust and then see if they were a threat to his friends.\n\nAll six other Fragments he was looking for were in this very city, three were in front of him, and these three were going to help him find the other three. His luck when it came to finding things was unbelievable\n\nGrrrrrrrrrrr.\n\nBut first, they would eat lunch.\n\n**Chapter End!  \nRemember the Poll, Shion is the LAST Naruto character that will appear in this story. **  \n**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure **  \n**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please**\n\n\n\t47. Chapter 47 The Start of Training\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"You... are... evil.\" Issei said as he gave Naruto the most evil glare he could, sweat pouring down his face as he crawled on the ground towards the finish line. Today Naruto had started Issei on his training, and true to his word he was going to make this both enjoyable and hell for Issei at the same time. Naruto was going to reward Issei on the days he did good, and punish him on the days that he didn't meet the goals that Naruto set in front of him. Right now of course Naruto was sitting on top of Issei's back while reading a book, well not really a book per say, but more of the fact that he was reading a magazine about how ot improve your skills with a sword. Basic moves and other related things, nothing to advanced, but something a little more than swing and cut.\n\n\"Demon, evil is in the job description nya. Now get back to work.\" Naruto ordered as he turned a page in his magazine without using any change in tone to say if he were annoyed with Issei or not. The boy had been complaining about the training a few minutes into the training when Naruto was making the boy do pull-ups... while trying not to get burned by the fire that Naruto had set under the bar. If Issei failed, then he would be getting burnt by the flames, so he had to use his armns to stay up in the air as long as possible. That was a good way to test how long Issei could hold out on his upper body strength. Then, Naruto had moved onto lower body strength and endurance, and testing this was controlled by Naruto forcing Issei to use his legs to hold up a pieace of wood in the air that had Naruto sitting on it... while moving the board up and down for as long as he could.\n\nNaruto didn't weigh much, but when you had to hold him in the air for thirty minutes you could get tired pretty quickly.\n\nFinally, Naruto was testing how far Issei was willing to go. Naruto was literally having Issei run ten miles while on all fours and with Naruto sitting right on his back so that he could make it harder, and moniter the results of the training.\n\n\"I would rather a girl be sitting there.\" Issei muttered under his breath, before Naruto whapped him upside the head for being a pervert while training. Issei looked up at Naruto with tears in his eyes from the stinging pain that was erupting from his head, before he saw Naruto looking down at him with disappointment.\n\n\"Idiot, you need to learn to train without needing perversion. That way you can unleash your full power without perversion nya. I have done these tests for every person in the peerage, and Rias herself. Put up with it.\" Naruto said with an annoyed look for real this time. He hated when people didn't stop complaining about stupid things like having a guy sit on your back to help you grow stronger. Of course, Naruto had never had a person sit on his back for training because they couldn't balance on him properly... the advantages of being small. People couldn't sit on you because their butts were wider than your back. So what if he couldn't reach the top shelf, he was hard to hit in a fight and people had trouble sitting on him and staying there.\n\n\"Why did you do it for the others?\" Issei asked curiously as he crossed the finish line, before he collapsed on his chest with even more sweat dripping from his face onto the ground. Naruto reached into his pocket and pulled out a few pieces of paper, before he placed them on the ground in front of Issei. The brown haired boy looked at the papers with a confused expression, before he saw names and numbers on them.\n\n_Name - Strength - Durability - Speed - Stamina - Magic Power_  \n_Rias Gremory - 3/10 - 4/10 - 4/10 - 6/10 - 7/10_  \n_Akeno Himejima - 7/10 - 5/10 - 2/10 - 7/10 - 5/10_  \n_Koneko Toujou - 6/10 - 7/10 - 3/10 - 8/10 - 3/10_  \n_Yuuto Kiba - 3/10 - 2/10 - 6/10 - 5/10 - 4/10_  \n_Gasper Vladi - 4/10 - 4/10 - 4/10 - 4/10 - 9/10_  \n_Murayama - 2/10 - 1/10 - 2/10 - 4/10 - 2/10_  \n_Katase - 1/10 - 2/10 - 1/10 - 3/10 - 3/10_  \n_Blaze Bolding - 2/10 - 3/10 - 6/10 - 6/10 - 3/10_  \n_Kalawarner - 3/10 - 3/10 - 4/10 - 2/10 - 6/10_  \n_Naruto Toujou - 7/10 - 6/10 - 6/10 - 10/10 - 10/10_  \n_Issei Hyoudou - 1/10 - 1/10 - 1/10 - 1/10 - 2/10_\n\n\"These are my stat cards I use to see how strong my allies are. Of course, these don't take SKILL or brain power into account nya. These are just physical and magical limits at the moment. How somebody uses these limits are up to them, and special abilities like Rias' Power of Destruction aren't added in that either nya.\" Naruto stated as he used a finger to start drawing in the dirt. The truth was that physically, Rias was among one of the weaker members of the group. Her natural limitations for physical power were more than covered by her amazing levels of magical power and skill, as well as her Power of Destruction, making her the second most powerful person in the group after Naruto himself. Rias was naturally attuned to using her magic for battle, and she had next to no skill at using her body in a fight. It just wasn't something she was good at, she tried and tried, but she had very little skill at hand to hand. It was her natural devil body that placed her above her own Pawns, who were barely stronger than humans in most cases without promoting.\n\n\"... Am I really that weak?\" Issei said as he pointed at his card with a depressed look on his face, and he wanted to start crying when Naruto nodded his head. Issei had never trained a day in his life before becoming a part of Rias' peerage, while all the others trained their asses off for varius reasons. Issei then looked at Gasper, before he grew even more depressed... before he blinked when he remembered that Gasper was a Bishop, yet all his stats seemed to be higher than what was average. Issei actually noticed that the average score for somebody without a piece enhancement was around two or three, while Gasper had an scores at mostly four. \"Why is Gasper so much stronger than me, the guy is so tiny... no offence.\" Issei questioned, before he apalogized when he realized that Naruto was even smaller than Gasper in the size department.\n\n\"None taken. I am small, I know that and accept it nya. Unlike you and, Yuuto, Murayama, Katase, Blaze, and Akeno, Gasper was a Dhampire before he became Rias' Bishop. Dhampires are Half-Vampires, and already have pretty good bodies to begin with. Not to mention that the piece that was used on Gasper was a strange one called a Mutation Piece, a piece that is mutated and worth multiple pieces nya. He got a small boost to everything, but his main boost was to his magic reserves.\" Naruto stated as he pointed to the stat that Gasper could claim was second to only Naruto's in the group. Gasper was the most well rounded of the group after Naruto physcially as well, but the boy's weakness was the fact that he hated figthing and getting close to new people. That held him back in a fight to the point that he was weaker than Rias, when Gasper should be stronger than she was. Rias was actually pretty weak if you took away her Power of Destruction, but because she had that she had the advantage over others.\n\n\"Aren't Akeno and Koneko both Rooks, so why are there stats different?\" Issei asked when he looked at the strength and durability of Koneko and Akeno. Naruto nodded at the question, before he took the cards from him.\n\n\"The boosts gained from the pieces aren't equal nya. Rias gained Akeno after becoming stronger with her magic, so the strength boost that Akeno got was stronger as well. Onee-chan on the other hand, had a naturally higher defence than Akeno before being turned, so while she didn't get as much strength, she got more defence. Just because two people are Knights, Rooks, or Bishops doesn't mean they will have the same speed or power nya.\" Naruto explained with a nod to himself. Grayfia was leagues more powerful than he was, and they were both Queens. She could out punch him, take his hits easily, and the only thing he beat her in was that fact that his natural reserves in magic and yokai were higher than hers.\n\n\"Is it possible to be more powerful than a ten?\" Issei asked another pretty smart question, and Naruto nodded to that as well.\n\n\"Yeah, the 10 in the stats can be surpassed, but then the limit stat changes from 10 to 15. The high number is only what your true limit is, and the lower number is how close you are to reaching that limit. I am closer to reaching my limit than the others, but that just means that my 10 will soon become a 15 and I will have a new limit to get to nya. Not only that, but because of my body type, my strength and speed are more compact, meaning that even if I am a 6 on speed, my size makes me around a 7 when compared to Yuuto nya.\" Naruto went into the explaination a bit deeper. He was proud of the stat system he had thought of for his allies, so that everyone could know how close they were to surpassing their limits.\n\nExample: If Naruto ever got to strength 11/10, then the stats would change to 11/15 to show that he had surpassed his old limits and had new ones. If he ever got to 16/15 then it would change again so that it was now 16/20 and so on and so on.\n\nAll of these stats were also just Base Stats, meaning that any other enhancements like Senjutsu and other things weren't being counted in the stats. That meant that using magic and other things could increae your strength, even if your base stat was only five, you could imitate a 7 or even 8 if you were creative enough with your magic. Ravel shot fire from her body in random spots to make her hits harder, and her speed higher than what it naturally was. Naruto was great at redirecting his Ki to various spots to his body to give him short bursts of strength, and the more energy he sent the stronger the boost in power, but the more dangerous it was for him to keep it going for long. Yuuto's speed was actually lowered though by his heavier swords, so this also worked in reverse.\n\nExample: If Yuuto summoned a sword that was too heavy for him, then his 6/10 would go down to a 2/10 easily, negating his abilities as a Knight.\n\nBasically, the first number was what your stat was, and the second number was what you limit was before you surpassed that limit.\n\n\"So how strong do you think I will have to be before I get a harem?\" Issei asked in a whisper as he looked around the area, before Nareuto crossed his arms and closed his eyes and thought about it for a second.\n\n\"Lets see, your only Battle Spell is the Dress Break, and that strips people... I would say that all of your stats would need to be a 2 before you were even ready for battle in real life. Right now you are still at the level of a newbie devil, the lowest of the low with no unnatural enhancements. If you want a harem though, I would say get all your stats to a four... of course, even raising your stat by one can be pretty tough.\" Naruto said with a nod, knowing just how hard it was to raise stats the old fashion way. It may sound like a game, but it wasn't. Unless you had tricks up your sleeve, then you needed blood, sweat, and tears to get stronger. Rias was born with her strength, and the others either trained before becoming devils, or were given their strength. It was actually harder for those with higher base stats to increase those stats through training, and the stronger you got the harder it got to get stronger unless you had an unnatural rate of growth.\n\n\"Gasper can form a harem!?\" Issei shouted in shock, before Naruto shrugged lightly.\n\n\"Well yeah, if he wanted to... if anyone knew what Gasper liked. Gasper is a perfect trap, so it is hard to find a girl that wants him as a boy, or a boy that would stay with him after finding out about his penis nya.\" Naruto said without a care. Gasper would always have trouble finding somebody to be with in a romantic sense, only somebody that didn't care about sex and knew Gasper as a person would be able to handle the guy.\n\n\"So I have to get as strong as Gasper to get a harem, you are sure about this?\" Issei questioned again as he grabbed the front of Naruto's shirt and pulled him so close to him that Naruto could smell his breath. Naruto's eye twitched, before he noticed the sparkle in Issei's eyes at now having a goal to reach for.\n\n\"Yeah, get as strong as Gasper and we will work on getting your harem nya.\" Naruto said with a twitching eye, being momented away from biting Issei to get him to let go. Lucky for Issei he seemed to realize that he was close to getting bitten, and let go of Naruto with a nervous look on his face.\n\n\"So... have you ever thought of getting a harem Naruto?\" Issei asked seemingly out of nowhere, before Naruto tilted his head in confusion.\n\n\"Not really, I don't really have a reason to form a harem. The only other girl besides Asia that likes me is Ravel, and you can kind of see why I don't want to be with her. I don't need a harem of babes to keep me happy nya. I'm not against it, but I am happy with what I have nya.\" Naruto answered simply, while Issei looked at the younger boy in surprise for being one of the relativally few men that hadn't at least dreamed of having more than one girlfriend. Most had at least imagined it before, even if only in passing. To see a person that just didn't care was surprising, and almost impossible to a pervert like Issei.\n\n\"Wow... you don't know what you are missing out on, but don't worry. When I become the Harem King I will be sure to send some of the ladies your way as a thanks for making me strong!\" Issei bragged with his soul fired up, and his body filled with energy at the very thought of gaining his own harem. Naruto chuckled a little as he scratched his cheek at how Issei really did regain his energy through perversion, this guy was a hot girl's worst nightmare as an opponent. Naruto stood up and gave Issei a pat on the back for dreaming big, and Issei was willing to put in the work to get that dream as well, something that Naruto respected. He prefered people like Issei that had a goal, and needed to work to achieve that goal. To actually have to undergo trials instead of everything just falling into his lap because he had a Sacred Gear, or because he was born with strength. Issei was a weak loser that had his Sacred Gear ripped from him, beginnings didn't get lower than that, which made it even more impressive if Issei actually became a High-Class Devil and got his harem.\n\nNaruto looked up at the sun, before he nodded to himself and made to leave. He was going to go meet up with the girls he met yesterday, because they said that had to meet somebody today.\n\nHe wondered who they had to met with.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t48. Chapter 48 Fool\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'Crap crap crap crap.' Naruto thought while silently sweating when he noticed something very wrong with the current image around him that was taking place. Right now Naruto was making sure that he was wearing one of the girl's cloaks properly so that everyone in the room couldn't see his face, and when Xenovia had asked why he needed to keep his face hidden from the devils Naruto had told them that he didn't want his face connected with Excalibur Ruler. It was too soon for him to reveal to his friends that he was able to wield holy swords, something that he himself had just learned. He hadn't even told Asia about this fact just yet, mostly because he didn't want to worry her. Right now though, he wished he could be anywhere else when he saw that evil look that Yuuto was sending at the small group of four. Naruto knew that Yuuto hated the Excalibur swords with a burning passion, so being in the same room as four of them at the same time must be murder on the boy's nerves.\n\n\"The atmosphere in here is kind of tense.\" Akeno commented lightly as she sat some tea down on the table, and Naruto almost reached out to take a cup by instinct. Naruto was sure that his hand twitching had caught somebodies attention, and he was right. His own sister was sending him a suspicious look, before she smelled the air when she noticed a _very_ familiar scent around the wielder of Excalibur Ruler. She closed her eyes, before the next time she opened them Naruto gulped lightly when he saw that her eyes were glowing with the urge to seemingly rip Naruto to shreds... it would seem that Koneko had made a mistake with her sense of smell. Naruto wanted to chuckle at how out of practice Koneko's nose was when it came to understanding scent. He could see it plainly written on her face that she didn't understand correctly why Naruto's smell was coming from Naruto.\n\nShe saw a guy holding a sword, that had her brother's scent on him, and no way to know if her brother was okay or not, but at the same time there was no smell of blood showing that her brother was perfectly fine as well. That would mean that she had no idea where her brother was, but she couldn't exactly trust any answer that she got out of the robed man without arising attention to the fact that her brother was missing. Then fingers would start to be pointed, and blame would be placed... Naruto could reveal himself now and save the trouble... but where would be the fun in that. He wanted to see this prank through to the end, and then see everyone's faces when they realized who he was.\n\n\"As it should be between a meeting of mortal enemies, and for it not the treaty I would have all of your heads.\" Shion stated with a dark look towards Rias, even more so the woman's hair. That bloody red color that she hated, and Rias noticed that Shion was glaring at her with such burning hatred in her eyes that even for a human she was releasing an amazing amount of killing intent without being completely insane. For a girl of her strength, this amount of killing intent was unheard of.\n\n\"Do you have a problem with me Exorcist-san?\" Rias asked with narrowed eyes of her own, before Shion stood up and placed her hand on the hilt of her sword. Yuuto looked ready to jump the girl, before Xenovia grabbed Shion by her hair and yanked her back down to the couch painfully. Naruto himself had been about ready to say screw it and beat the hell out of Shion for making a hostile move towards Rias.\n\n\"I am sorry for her actions. Her family has a great hatred for the Gremory.\" Xenovia stated with a small inclination of her head, before Rias looked at Shion in confusion. It was obvious that she had no idea why such a person that hated her family existed, they had always been one of the most kind families to humans, even before Devils became more civilized and stopped stealing people's souls.\n\n\"The reason may I ask? Please sate my curiousity before you inform me of the reason you are in my city.\" Rias requested in a tone that demanded that her question be answered, and Shion looked more than happy to give the woman the explaination that she wanted.\n\n\"You Gremory sluts, don't you dare stop me Xenovia!\" Shion yelled at Xenovia before she could be stopped, and all the of devils in the room looked like they were about to attack Shion for the blatant insult directed at Rias and her family. Rias herself looked like she was a few moments away from blowing her top at the disrespect her family was getting. Shion turned her hate filled eyes back to Rias, before they narrowed again. \"If I had known that I would be dealing with a Gremory, then I wouldn't have come. Your damn brother defilled the resting place of the greatest human to ever walk this Earth, a man that slayed a Primordial God. Ever sense, my family has been trying for centuries to reclaim what has been stolen, but he refuses every time.\" Shion stated, before she felt a hand grip her shoulder tightly, so tightly that cracks could be heard coming from her shoulder as she winced in pain.\n\n\"Go cool your head Shion, you must not blame this naive girl for what her family did. Now leave, and come back when you can be mature.\" Xenovia ordered Shion with her full authority, and knowing that she couldn't resist a direct order Shion flipped Rias off rudely, before she walked out of the room with her sword hand shaking with her sword handle being gripped hard enough that her blood was falling to the floor. Shion opened the door, before she walked out of the room and slammed the door hard enough that a loud bang forced Koneko and the disguised Naruto to flinch at the loud noise. \"I am sorry about her behavior, she has personal issues with your brother. I should have known that she would act as such... but I do not disagree with her. If I myself had the chance without affecting the stand-off between Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels, then I myself would be slaying all of you.\" Xenovia stated to Rias without any open hostility, despite the fact she just gave Rias a death threat.\n\n'Women are scary.' Gasper thought as he slowly started to tear up at the frightening new people in the room as him, before he felt Issei's hand on his shoulder in an attempt to help give the younger boy some much needed confidence.\n\n\"Xenovia! Don't call it slaying, that is so mean. All we are doing is showing them God's love and purifying them of their sins.\" Irina said with a pout at how crude Xenvoia was calling the killing of devils.\n\n\"Yeah, even if you girls tried to slay this group, you will find some trouble. There are some freaks of nature here.\" Kalawarner warned from her spot of leaning against the wall, a smirk on her face.\n\n\"I represent that comment, I know what I said.\" Blaze stated when he saw the Koneko looked like she was about to correct him. Normally a person would say resent, but Blaze was proud of the fact that he was a freak of nature, so he proudly claimed that he represented the remark.\n\n\"That's right, this brute has some tricks of his own. This entire group has a few tricks.\" Katase stated with a frown on her face, while Naruto smiled under the hood proudly at how well the group was functioning without him holding the group together.\n\n\"Yeah, you can bring an army of Holy sword users if you want, but we have something that you can't stand up against. Somebody that does his name proud, and stands above us as the goal we all strive for. He is the Maelstrom Queen of the Gremory, a force of nature that will rip asunder all those caught in his might.\" Rias bragged to the Holy Sword users, not knowing that the very person she was talking about so proudly was sitting right in front of them, and if they could see his face then they would see just how much that he was blushing over the praises that he was recieving. Naruto had always known that he was looked up to, even if he had to be looked down at. He never had any idea that even Rias respected him as a person this much, and to consider him a force of nature like his name was one of the best compliments that she could give him.\n\n\"Buchou is right, Kitten-chan would destroy you all.\" Akeno said, completely ruining the happy vibes that Naruto had been getting from how Rias was talking about him. Akeno then learned the meaning of pain when she heard a boom and was shot in the side of the head thanks to Blaze holding a gun at her. Her Rook defence kept her alive, but boy was she going to be feeling that one. Rias sighed once more at how Blaze acted when people insulted Naruto when he wasn't around, before she looked back at Xenovia, Naruto, and Irina.\n\n\"Sounds like a little cutey, but not the reason we came to the city. We are here on a mission to find and bring back three of the seven Excalibur Fragments that had been stolen.\" Irina stated with a knowing look on her face, while Naruto saw that Yuuto looked like evil was about to start pouring out of every pour in his body now that it was confirmed that all seven fragments of Excalibur were in this very city.\n\n\"Sorry if this is a newbie question, but isn't there only suppose to be ONE Excali-\" Murayama pointed out, before she was rudely interupted when Naruto jumped up from his seat and pointed at her with the tip of his sword.\n\n\"Fool! The legend of Excalibur begin in the 12th century on a cool Tuesday evening in the middle of winter, and on the Summer morning it was cracked on that very Friday and shattered on the same Sunday evening.\" Naruto couldn't resist the perfect opening for a little humor, and he made sure to talk in a slightly deeper voice. Rias' jaw was on the floor, and her cheeks bulged when she covered her mouth and started to shake like crazy when she heard somebody make that reference during an important meeting. Tears were leaking from her eyes at how hard she was trying to keep herself from laughing, before Katase stepped forward.\n\n\"Okay, be seriou-\" Katase started as well, before she had the sword tip pointed in her face.\n\n\"Fool!... I begin my mornings with a cup of tea at a coffee house in the afternoons.\" Naruto stated as Katase moved the sword from her face with a twitching eyebrow at being interupted as well. Rias was slowly starting to turn red in the face when Naruto continued to annoy the hell out of everyone in the room, even if she didn't know that it was Naruto doing it.\n\n'I'm going to pee!' Rias thought as her full body was shaking from the repressed laughter at the Soul Eater reference used with an actual Excalibur sword. She was gripping her gut as hard as possible to stop herself from laughing so hard that she pee'd herself. She knew that she shouldn't be laughing right now, but to have somebody doing this with the Excalibur sword was way to much for her to handle when it came to humor.\n\n\"Ara ar-\" Akeno started next, before she found the sword pointed at her face next before she could even finish her usual ara ara like she always did before making a snide comment about something.\n\n\"Fool... okay, I am done now.\" Naruto stated as he sat back down with his sword sitting across his lap, and his face still covered. Naruto saw Rias curled up into a ball trying to keep herself from laughing, and he smirked lightly at how he made the room a lot less tense with his constant interuptions.\n\nEven YUUTO looked confused by what had happened, instead of angry at the fact that he was in the same room as the Excalibur fragments.\n\n'Damnit Otouto, of all the stupid things.' Koneko thought while shaking her head, now knowing without a doubt that the person underneath the cloak was indeed Naruto. Only her little brother would be stupid enough to hide amongst the enemy with a Holy sword in his possession while mocking Rias when she had no idea who he was at the time. Rias was sure in for a great surprise when she learned that she had said all those nice things about Naruto while he was in the same room as her. Really, she knew for a fact that Naruto got that kind of behavior from all the time their sister would prank Sirzechs and get away with it by using Naruto as a cute shield to turn Sirzechs' annoyance into his desire for a younger brother of his own. Naruto tormented Rias in similar ways as Kuroka tormented the current Lucifer, and from the stories they had heard the same way that their mother had tormented people in general.\n\n'What the hell? How is this idiot a user of Excalibur?' Yuuto thought for a brief moment, and it was his own fortune that he didn't say those thoughts out loud.\n\n\"Anyway! We aren't here for your permission, nor do we care what you do. All we want is for you to keep your noses out of our business, and let us handle the retrieval of swords of God.\" Xenovia said with a look towards the cloaked Naruto, who held his hands up in surrender in a way showing that he would be a good boy. He wondered where Asia was for a brief moment, before he decided that he would believe in her ability to defend herself or call him if she needed him. Rias looked like she was still having trouble breathing right without the threat of busting a gut laughing, while Akeno gave a small smile.\n\n\"Oh don't worry, if you should meet gruesome ends then we won't lift a finger to help you all.\" Akeno commented slyly, knowing that she was basically telling them that if they landed up a creak without a paddle they were pretty much fucked. Naruto's face twitched when he realized that most of the others weren't the most helpful of people when there wasn't an idiot in the group willing to help others. Now that he realized this, he knew that he was going to have to work on everyones ability to desire to help others.\n\n\"Well, I am out. I have better things to do.\" Blaze stated after a moment as he left the room with a sigh, while Kalawarner followed after him like she always did. Naruto watched them leave, and he wasn't 100 percent sure, but he was pretty sure that the two of them had something going on between them. The two seemed to have bonded since they killed each other, and for two war mongers killing each other was like the same thing as a confession.\n\n\"Yeah, this has gotten pretty boring.\" Kalawarner agreed with the mixed eyed boy, before they completely left the room filled with sweat dropping people.\n\n\"I am sorry about him, he is one of my more disrespectful members. I would like to say that his opinions do not relfect my own.\" Rias said when she finally calmed herself down. Naruto shrugged at how she pretty much described Blaze to a T, he never really listened to anyway that hadn't gotten his respect in battle. Rias didn't have that respect, so he would refuse to listen to any order she gave unless he agreed with it as well. Blaze would rather die than follow somebody he didn't respect, something that Naruto respected about the teen.\n\n\"It matters not, but we have overstayed out welcome. See you later Issei-kun!\" Irina said as she waved to Issei as the two girls and one boy stood up and started to walk out of the room, while Naruto looked back at them. He wondered how Irina and Issei knew each other... he would have to ask one of them later. He would admit that he doubt they became friends recently with him being a devil, and her being a follower of the Church. That would hint that them being friends before he became a devil, well he would find out later anyway. Just when the girls left, Naruto turned back around and looked back at the group.\n\n\"Yeah, see you later Yuuto... you better destroy the Excaliburs before I get to them, or you will never have the chance to destroy them for your revenge again.\" Naruto hinted to his own identity, before he walked out of the room. He knew for a fact that he had shocked more than a few people into confusion, the most shocked being Yuuto. Naruto ran towards the girls, before he jumped into the air and wrapped his legs around Xenovia's waist and hung on it a way that made it look like there was only one big person under the cloak instead of two people.\n\n\"So, who do you think this Maelstrom Queen of the Gremory is?\" Irina asked to thin air, before all she got were blank looks as Shion joined the group with a slightly more level look to her.\n\n\"Sorry about my anger earlier, but I am ready to get the job done now.\" Shion said with a small bow to them, and she sighed when she got no responce in return, meaning that either they had forgiven her, or they were in deep thought about something at the moment. The way they looked she would guess that they were each in deep thought about something she hadn't been informed of yet. They all turned when they heard the door open quickly as Yuuto and the other devils rushed into the hallway. Yuuto stood in front of the group as he looked towards Naruto and Xenovia.\n\n\"You... I want to fight you.\" Yuuto said as he pointed to what he thought was the only male human of the group, before Naruto hopped from Xenovia and stood in front of Yuuto with a hidden grin on his face.\n\n\"Sounds fun, I'm in.\" Naruto said, knowing that Yuuto was going to be in for a big surprise. He could feel the killing intent coming from Yuuto, and he had to admit that he had wanted an excuse to fight against Yuuto like this for awhile now. Yuuto never fought with his full power against Naruto before, and Naruto's natural combat instinct did NOT like it when his opponent held back against him just because they were friends. This would be the greatest way to insure that Yuuto didn't hold back against him, as well as knock some sense into Yuuto that hating the wielders of Holy Swords would do nothing.\n\nThis was going to be fun... for Naruto.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t49. Chapter 49 Broken Sword\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Short Chapter, busy with Father's Day. **_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Show me your head.\" Yuuto demanded when everyone stood behind the building the club building, and his tone suggested that he was angry at Naruto at this moment. Naruto didn't show it, but he was smirking under the cloak. He was sure that Yuuto was going to be learning a big lesson by the end of this fight, and Yuuto would without a doubt be a changed man once this fight was finished. If he was going to change for the better or the worse was completely up to Yuuto though, but Naruto hoped that it was for the better.\n\n\"Sorry, but I don't show that to guys. If you were a girl, then you might get a view of the goods.\" Naruto stated mockingly as he reached to his crotch and gave it a pat, before Yuuto twitched and swords of various apparences sprang out of the ground around Yuuto like magic. The boy grabbed two of the swords, before Naruto decided to mock Yuuto a little more seriously. \"Ah, the Sword Birth, no wonder you hate Excalibur. It was the Sword Birth user that excaped the Holy Sword Project all those years ago, oh yeah, you were laying dead in the snow before the red head over there found you.\" Naruto said with a frown on his face, evejn if he made his tone slightly mocking. He was just getting Yuuto as nagry as possible before the duel started.\n\n\"This is just a match Yuuto, no killing.\" Rias ordered her servant, before he sent her a dangerous glance, but nodded anyway. He would avoid killing blows because of her orders, but he glared at the shorter figure holding the Excalibur Ruler over his shoulder like it was nothing of big importance.\n\n\"Now that is no fun, if he doesn't come at me with the intent to kill, he won't even land a hit on me. So try and kill me Yuuto-chan, because I want to see what the surviver of the Holy Sword Project can do.\" Naruto said, knowing that if he kept pushing it then Yuuto would snap. Yuuto snapping would be the biggest part of the plan to get rid of Yuuto's need for revenge. Yuuto already looked like he was going to ignore Rias and try his damned hardest to kill Naruto, and that was what he needed to be feeling for this lesson to take full affect. Naruto could see Yuuto glaring at both the sword and Naruto, before the swords he was holding burst into flame and the other froze solid.\n\n\"This is what I can do!\" Yuuto said as he vanished from in front of Naruto and appeared behind him with both swords posed to cut through Naruto's shoulders. Naruto didn't need a sword style to be able to use a sword to block both blades, simple because with his speed and reflexes he would be more than able to react in time to anything that Yuuto was able to do in his angry state. That was why it was a simple matter for the flexible Naruto to use the sword to protect his back from both blades with one move, before he forced Yuuto into the air with both of his swords broken when Naruto moved his sword back to his front. Naruto looked over to the crowd to see them all impressed at the fact that a 'human' was able to use a sword to force back Yuuto and break his swords, while also being able to react to the enhanced speed of the Knight.\n\n\"If that is all, then I'm not impressed. You will never be able to destroy the Excalibur swords Yuuto-chan... so you are fast.\" Naruto commented like he didn't know about Yuuto's speed when the boy appeared in front of Naruto with a sword already in his hand again in mid swing. Naruto swung Excalibur Ruler and busted through the sword again, with metal fragments scattering all around them as the demonic sword was broken to nothing. Yuuto firmly placed his foot against the ground, before a sword shot out of the ground and landed in his other hand. Yuuto spun around and used his impressive speed once more to change direction sightly so that he was attacking from Naruto's unarmed side, before Naruto armed that side by tossing the Excalibur to his left hand and swinging it so that he once more destroyed Yuuto's sword before it could touch him. Only this time, Yuuto continued to spin so that it begame clear that he was holding a dagger in his teeth, but Naruto stabbed Excalibur Ruler into the ground just before the dagger could stab Naruto's hand.\n\nThen, Naruto pimp slapped Yuuto clear across his face and sent the boy flying and crashing into a tree painfully. Cat reflexes were truly an amazing thing, they made even an newbie with a sword something dangerous. Naruto's speed and reflexes, not to mention strength, more than made up for his lack of actual sword style.\n\n\"The hell just happened!?\" Issei shouted from the group watching when he watched Yuuto continue to just vanish, before somehow Naruto swung his arm and pimp slapped Yuuto. To Issei, he hadn't been able to see Yuuto move the entire time, so it was like Naruto was just swinging his sword at nothing with shards of metal crashing around every time he swung the sword. Then Yuuto appeared out of nowhere with a big red mark of his cheek and a bleeding lip from when Naruto's hand smacked the sense out of him.\n\n\"I kept the pimp hand strong, and made your Knight my bitch. Come on Yuuto-chan, why don't you stop using Sword Birth and start to use Blade Blacksmith. I know you also have that Sacred Gear inside you, so why don't you start using Holy and Demonic Swords together n...\" Naruto started, before he interupted himself when he almost gave himself away with his verbal tic. Naruto covered his mouth with his free hand, because he was sure that he had been good about not saying for awhile now.\n\n\"How do you know all of this!?\" Yuuto shouted in a fury at how it was revealed that he had a second Sacred Gear that created Holy swords like his Sword Birth created Demonic Swords. He hated having a Sacred Gear that made Holy swords, so he never used it. He was sure that only Rias was fully aware of the fact he had a second Sacred Gear, or at least she had heard from the only person that he had ever told. Yet, there was no way that Naruto would ever tell this joker that he had the Blade Blacksmith, it just wasn't possible.\n\n\"I know everything about you Yuuto-chan, even that you need to move passed all of your friends deaths. They died, they are dead, and seaking revenge against a SWORD won't bring them back, because guess what... they have passed away. You know this, but you have to have something to blame. Man up and accept their deaths Yuuto-chan.\" Naruto said with his arms crossed, and Excalibur Ruler still stabbed into the ground in front of him. Yuuto was staring at Naruto in utter shock, his face morphed into an expression not fitting for somebody as handsome as he was... before his face became ugly with rage. Such rage that his demonic power was slightly visible around him, before Naruto placed his finger on the handle of the Excalibur fragment.\n\n\"I will kill you! Excalibur should never have existed, and I am doing the world a favor by destroying it and getting revenge!\" Yuuto shouted as the largest sword with a demonically spiked edge burst from the ground and into both of his hands. Naruto smirked under the cloak, before he used his free hand and mocked Yuuto with the 'come on' motion. He knew for a fact that Yuuto would have made the mistake of trading speed for power, something that went against his style, and now that he had he was assured his swift defeat. Yuuto started to run towards Naruto MUCH slower than he had before, but Naruto still made zero moves to stop him at all. Yuuto was mere feet away from Naruto, before Naruto's voice rang out through the entire field.\n\n\"Kneel before me.\" Was the simple command that Naruto gave out, and like a stone in the water Yuuto dropped to his knees with his sword stabbed into the ground next to him. Yuuto looked up in shock at his body not obeying his commands anymore, before he saw out of the sides of his eyes that the others were in the exact same situation as he was. Yuuto glared up at Naruto with all his rage in his eyes, before Naruto took his sword from the ground and pointed it at Yuuto. \"One command... one command is all I would need to wipe your brain of revenge. You don't have nearly enough guts to resist, and your willpower is weakened by your desire for revenge. I can make you kill your friends, and I could make them just sit there and die... is your revenge worth you LIVING friend's lives?\" Naruto questioned with a hard look on his face, even under the cloak he was sure that his hard stare penetrated Yuuto to his core when he looked over at his friends in horror.\n\n\"That is enough!\" Xenovia shouted towards Naruto, with she herself standing thanks to her already knowing about Excalibur Ruler's power and having a iron will of her own that let her refuse the command. Not to mention that she had the protection of her own Excalibur Desctruction to thank for helping her resist the command.\n\n\"Heh, I guess I got carried away. You can stand now.\" Naruto said with a wave of his hand when everyone on the ground felt their ability to move around return to them. Naruto saw Yuuto looking at the ground in shock, before Naruto pointed his sword at Yuuto and gave a new order. \"Stand and listen to my words... good.\" Naruto said when Yuuto stood against his will, but this was the best way for Yuuto to learn his lesson. The boy was looking at Naruto blankly, his eyes showing that something in him had been broken. Naruto knew that Yuuto would have to piece himself back together from having his very beliefs and goals for the future crashed around him by Naruto forcing him to see that his actions will bring pain to others. \"Yuuto, if you continue on this path, then you will be hurting all of your friends. You might even have to lose them to complete your goal.\" Naruto stated as he looked over towards his friends and sister to see that Koneko had her hand out in front of the group to keep them from going any closer to the boys.\n\n\"I will... I can't... I won't.\" Yuuto couldn't even finish a complete though with how much was being dumped on him at once.\n\n\"Are your living friends lives worth less to you than getting revenge for dead people? What use do the dead have for revenge, will it comfort them to know you are destroying yourself when nothing will change for them? This duel is done, try again when you know who you are going to be Yuuto.\" Naruto said as he turned around and started to walk away now that he had broken Yuuto's views, but the next part would be completely up to Yuuto. If Yuuto became a better person, or if he became even more obsessed with his revenge.\n\n\"Do you know him?\" Xenovia asked as the group of four started to walk away, and Naruto noded slightly when he saw that they were out of sight of the others after awhile of walking. Taking the hoad of Xenovia's cloak off of him, Naruto smiled widely.\n\n\"Yeah, Yuuto and I go way back nya. Stories for another time though.\" Naruto said with a wave of his hand, knowing that Xenovia was slightly suspicious, but she would still believe him because of his status as a user of Holy Swords. She looked at Excalibur Ruler, now having 100 percent proof that was indeed the sword that had been missing. Before now, it could have been possible that the sword was a fake, but seeing him control people against their will proved that it was the strongest of the Excalibur swords.\n\n\"Lets just find the other fragments, the second I am out of this city the better.\" Shion stated with an angry look returning to her face. Naruto raised an eyebrow, before he shrugged it off. He didn't really care why she was angry, so long as she didn't actually try anything against Rias. Naruto kicking Yuuto's ass aside, he wouldn't let anyone hurt his friends if he could help it.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t50. Chapter 50 Four of Seven\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Is this really needed nya?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow when he came out of the changing room in the Church dressed in official battle atire provided for him by the three girls. Naruto was looking directly at them, and he was sure that Shion was going to bust a gut any second now. Irina had stars in her eyes at how Naruto was dressed up, and how cute it made him seem. Xenovia was looking Naruto over with a critical eye, trying to find any faults with the clothes, or with his reaction to the clothes. Apparently, from what he had been told, if Naruto was to really help them by wielding his Excalibur Ruler then he would have to dress the part. She didn't give other reasons, but Naruto knew from the small amount of time he spent with her that Xenovia was not one for jokes.\n\nThat was why he was wearing a slightly modified version of their own Church battle uniforms, and by slightly modified he meant that his was actually just one of Xenovia's older ones that she couldn't wear anymore thanks to her chest, but she caried around anyway just in case they came across somebody young with the ability to use a Holy sword. Now he too was clad the tight black clothes that clung to his skin so tightly that he couldn't even tell how he got this on in the first place, before he remembered that it was able to stretch a little so that the wearer could put it on.\n\n\"Yes, our uniforms are made to cut down on air resistance and provide us with protection from minor forms of magic. They must be tight or else who knows what might try crawling into the uniform.\" Irina explained for her leader, while Naruto looked at his clothes with a raised eyebrow. He hadn't known about the resistance to magic, even if it was a minor resistance it would come in handy should he ever get into a fight with a long distance magic user. He could laready tank most spells, but being able to move faster and with more flexibility would only make him that much more deadly. He could see why the Church had their Holy Sword users wearing these. These helped cut down the advantages that devils and fallen angels had over them, as well as provide a decent distraction against perverted opponents.\n\n\"It actually looks good on you.\" Shion commented neutrally, and Naruto nodded lightly as he looked himself over. People didn't usually notice because they only saw girls wearing these, but these clothes were pretty gender neutral. People of both genders could wear them as long as they were slightly modified to fit each gender. Naruto's was modified so that instead of the long socks the girls had, Naruto had boots connect to his shorter socks that only went about two inches above the boots. Naruto's gloves were also shorter than the girls, being only long enough to go up to his elbows instead of up his entire arm.\n\n\"More importantly, is shows that you are one of us. It also has spells woven into it that will help control and conceal your aura from being sensed by any devils in the area. Of course, these are also our thank you for fixing up the Church and paying for our meals.\" Xenovia said with her hand going to her stomach when she remembered how good the meal was. Irina and Shion also had dreamy smiles when they remembered food that wasn't bland in taste, or burnt by Xenovia. Shion covered her mouth when she felt the urge to throw up at the mere memory of the last time that she ate Xenovia's god aweful cooking. Xenovia didn't cook with flavor in mind, instead she cooked with nutrients and health in mind, while packing every meal with enough nutrients to last three meals.\n\n\"I don't know, I think he should take the pants off.\" Irina said with a slight frown on her face when she saw Naruto wearing his black Kuoh Academy uniform pants.\n\n\"These thing is pressing against my crotch as well you know, and I would rather NOT advertise my crotch. Not to mention that if Pedobear comes and see a Shota or Loliu in skin-tight close it will lose it's shit and try to capture me nya.\" Naruto stated firmly, knowing that he would keep wearing this pants. It wasn't like they didn't go with the unitard, and Naruto was being semi-truthful when he said that he would rather not advertise his crotch. Unlike the girls, no matter what they wore their breasts were on display, and they had something to gain from that. Naruto's crotch being on display gained him nothing at all, so he saw no reason for that to be displayed. He also had another reason... sometimes when Naruto got into a fight he got a little hard from his blood pumping during a fight, so some looser clothes were better. Tight clothes while being slightly hard did not go together.\n\n\"I have no idea how to respond to that, nor do I get the reference.\" Xenovia said with dull eyes at how weird Naruto's sentence was to her. Shion smacked her forehead at how oblivious to modern trends and other such things Xenovia was. The girl had no common sense, and she didn't have a whole lot of skills when it came to things that most people would find natural. She had been raised in the Church most of her life, so Xenovia was very sheltered.\n\n\"Pedobear is a bear that preys on people with young looking bodies, either children or teens with younger looking bodies. Keep up with the times Xenovia, sheesh. Seriously, almost everyone knows abou the Pedobear.\" Shion complained with a frown on her face, while Xenovia raised an eyebrow at how testy Shion seemed lately.\n\n\"My lack of modern day know how aside, how are we going to go about finding the stolen Excalibur fragments?\" Xenovia asked the group with a face that stayed about the same, but with her eyebrows furrowed lightly to show that she herself didn't have an idea on what to do. Naruto thought about it for a moment, before an idea started to take form in his head.\n\n\"What do you think Shion? What is your Clear Future telling you?\" Irina asked Shion, while Naruto raised an eyebrow at how they were asking Shion about the future. Shion looked towards Naruto and saw that slight confusion.\n\n\"I have a Sacred Gear that allows me to see the future... but I can only use it once a week to look at what I want to see, but I pass out a few minutes after I use it.\" Shion said as she picked up the crystal bell from her uniform, and Naruto sensed her channel a small amount of magic into the bell... before he heard the most beautiful sound of the bell ringing. The bell even glowed blue as it rang, before Naruto witheld a gasp at how her eyes started to change so that they were an amazing glowing and changing lavender color. Shion's face went blank for a moment, before she collapsed backwards into Irina's arms. She was starting to sweat lightly, and Naruto felt her large amount of her power drop. The bell stopped ringing, and for saw that she was looking at him in shock for a moment.\n\n\"What did you see, quickly before you pass out.\" Irina demanded quickly, knowing that Shion was going to pass out any moment now. Shion started to breath deeply, before she looked at the ground.\n\n\"The True Excalibur will be reborn, and the clashing of the Infinite Orange Sun and Black Moon of Dreams will shake this city. I saw blood and death, two humans will die, a fallen angel, and a devil... you are among the dead Naruto.\" Shion stated with a grim and tired look towards Naruto, while he rubbed the back of his head slightly. Irina gasped lightly, before she looked at Naruto like he was already among the dead. Shion passed out before she could say anymore though, and Naruto couldn't help but look at the only person that had the answers without needing to be asked.\n\n\"Shion's Sacred Gear gives her flashes of God's plan for the future, but to see into the future she must also see the deaths of those around her in that future. She MUST see death to see the future, and her visions are never wrong. She has predicted the future and deaths of over 400 people without fail.\" Xenovia stated neutrally, not having been around Naruto long enough for the news of his future death to really affect her. She was sad that they would be losing a fine young man to wield the strongest Excalibur, and she was sure that Naruto was a good person, but she had no idea how he died because she couldn't see the future.\n\n\"Well, I'm not dying anytime soon nya. I am more worried about the first and second parts of what she said.\" Naruto stated in reference to the True Excalibur being reborn, and the sun and moon comment she made. Naruto scratched his chin, before a plan fully worked it's way into his head that would insure that he would be the person in possession of the Excalibur in it's fullest form. Naruto smirked lightly, before he removed the smirk from his face. Over 400 predicted deaths was a pretty impressive record, so he had to admit to being slightly fearful that he would be dying soon, but he was the kind of man that would spit in the face of death.\n\n\"Wow, to you this must just be another of God's trials to face, I respect that.\" Irina said with respect in her voice, while Xenovia nodded lightly in agreement. It wasn't every day that somebody brushed off their own death like it was nothing, so that was why she picked up the dropped Excalibur Blessing and tossed it to Naruto with a very small smile on her face. So small in fact that most people wouldn't even know it.\n\n\"Then here, if you want to survive you will need as much help as you can get. You have massive reserves and Excalibur Ruler, so that sword will be great for you. Shion was never much of a swordswomen, so she won't mind very much. She won't wake up for awhile anyway, so it will jst be you and me for awhile... Irina.\" Xenovia hinted, and the twin tailed girl nodded and took the robe from her arm before she gave it to Xenovia with a small smile of her own while Xenovia forced Excalibur Mimic into taking the shape of a light grey European sword. It was just the basic sword, but the edges of the sword were lined purple.\n\n\"Got it, I'll watch over Shion while she is out. I hope you don't die.\" Irina said to the two of them, while Naruto nodded lightly as well. He was going to make sure that nobody died, but at the same time he was going to make sure that he also got his hands on the Excalibur when it reformed... however it reformed that is. He still didn't have the answer to how that happened, but he needed to make sure that the sword was restored to it's former glory. Naruto sweat dropped when he realized that they would either get the swords and reforge them, or the swords would be stolen and then reforged. It would be one or the other, and as the two of thejm walked out of the Church Naruto couldn't help but sigh in annoyance at how they weren't going to be able to do this without putting some brains into it.\n\n\"So, I think I have you figured out.\" Xenovia finally stated neutrally, and with a frown on her face when she turned to look at Naruto when they were out of the Church and far enough away so that even if Irina left the Church she wouldn't hear what they were talking about. Naruto rose an eyebrow at her, before he started to sweat very lightly when he figured out what she was refering to. He hoped that she wasn't talking about his devil status, because if she was then he had no idea why she hadn't brought it up before now. He noticed the look on her face, and he could tell that she had been putting some deep thought into this.\n\n\"You think you do huh?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow when he regained his confidence in the situation. Obviously he didn't have a problem, because if Xenovia was going to treat him like an enemy then she wouldn't have let him have the Excalibur Blessing so easily. She would actually be against it.\n\n\"Not just you, but this entire situation... I have known something was off about you from the moment I met you. I just never got the chance to talk to you alone and hash this out. You are short, but you are able to match and surpass the speed of the Knight of a Devil's peerage. You seemed to not want to have your face shown to the devils, but had no problems with fighting one and risking your face getting seen... showing that you know how they fight and were sure of your victory without being seen. Not to mention that your massive reserves are suppressed the second you enter a Church... you are a Devil.\" Xenovia said with her arms crossed under her large chest, and she was giving Naruto a look that said that she wasn't taking an excuses for his actions. She knew for a fact by this point, but she wanted to figure some other things out.\n\n\"Yet you haven't attacked me, nor have you tried to take my Excalibur... you even gave me Excalibur Blessing nya.\" Naruto said right back to her, and she nodded to him and her face became serious.\n\n\"I was curious, a devil was wielding a Holy Sword, and you are doing it without the need for an item or Sacred Gear giving you the ability to use them. You can enter the Church without bringing punishment on you, and you have no problems with us who slay devils. You were fixing up the Church as well.\" Xenovia pointed out even more of the strange things she had noticed about Naruto. Naruto raised an eyebrow at her, before she nodded and decided to keep on going with what she had noticed so far. \"God should have had you destroyed for just holding onto a fragment of the holy sword, and you should be dead for entering the Church... that doesn't add up. You were either once a human with a talent for Holy Swords, or God is dead and the balance between Holy and Unholy is out of order.\" Xenovia conluded with a face that showed she would rather the answer to why Naruto could use a Holy sword be the first, and not the second one.\n\nFrankly, if a Primordial God could be killed by a human like in the stories she had heard from Shion, then it only made sense that other God's could die as well.\n\nIt would also make sense as to why Holy Sword users needed to be created with stones like Irina had to have placed into her, and not just have people being given God's blessing.\n\n\"Sorry, but I was, and still am, a Nekoshou before being turned into a part-Devil by Rias... we can't tell anyone about this, can we?\" Naruto asked with a frown when he reached the same conclusion that Xenovia did about the Biblical God being dead... or at least in a state of non-being. There were some kinds of beings that died, before they reformed after a certain amount of time had passed since thier deaths. It was impossible to say what it was in this case, while Xenovia nodded to Naruto.\n\n\"Yes, this is a secret that shouldn't be known. If this were to become public knowledge, then the order that is being maintained by the stand-off would be broken and war would break out once more. Christians would be crushed and chaos would reign among humans, the devils would respond with violence, as would the Fallen Angels. The Angels might not even know about this, or if they do they have been keeping it a secret as well.\" Xenovia said after a few moments of thought, before she sighed. This would mean that she would have to leave the Church so that she wouldn't risk letting the secret loose on accident... no, just by her knowing this secret she would nbe labled as a heretic and banished from the Church. She knew this for fact, because the needs of the many would almost always weigh more than her needs as a person.\n\n\"Damn, this is annoying nya... I have little doubt my Onee-sama knew about this. She seems to know about everything nya. Yeah, this will have to be a secret between us... but do you still plan to retrieve the Excalibur Fragments nya?\" Naruto asked curiously, and Xenovia nodded slightly, but unsurely.\n\n\"Yes, but not for the same reason as before. Is Shion has predicted that the Excalibur will become one sword again, then I don't think that such a sword should stay at the Church... it would be too much of a risk. It would draw too much attention to it, and others would try to steal it. It needs to be in a place where it will be safe, with somebody that can watch over it and actually use it to make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\" Xenovia said with a signifigant look towards Naruto, while his eyes widened and he pointed to himself in shock when he figured out who she was refering to.\n\n\"Wait, we haven't known each other long, and you are willing to trust me with the True Excalibur nya!?\" Naruto questioned in shock, while she nodded with a light smirk on her face.\n\n\"Yes, honestly, you seem to be the perfect person to let keep the sword. You help others, even if it will bring trouble to you. You helped me and my allies, you helped somebody that could hate you for doing it, and even after figuring you out you haven't silenced me to keep your secret. You are also strong, very strong in fact Maelstrom Queen of the Gremory. I have always been a good judge of character, and you are the kind of person that makes other want to become better people... a leader among leaders.\" Xenovia said as she stabbed Excalibur Mimic into the ground and took a step back from it with a smile on her face as she gestured to it with one hand.\n\n\"We haven't known each other long nya.\" Naruto pointed out again, before Xenovia nodded and looked him dead in the eye.\n\n\"I don't know why either, but you have this aura around you... an aura that makes me want to place my faith in you. If anyone should wield Excalibur, it should be somebody that can protect the sword without needing the sword.\" Xenovia stated as she gestured to the blade stabbed into the ground again, before Naruto nodded and stepped forward to take the blade out of the ground. Like with Excalibur Ruler, the sword jerked out of the stone without any trouble. Naruto didn't know why, but he was touched by Xenovia's words. If she said that she was just going to give him these swords, then he was going to believe her.\n\n\"Thank you Xenovia, from now on you are one of my friends. If you ever need me, then you can count on my help.\" Naruto stated back to her as he transformed Excalibur Mimic into the rope form from earlier and tied it around his arm. Xenovia coughed into her hand, before Naruto noticed that she seemed to be looking at him with a look of expectation on her face.\n\n\"As it well seems, I already need to ask for help. As the leader of my team, I would be punished for not only allowing a devil into the Church, but also learning of God's death and giving the Excalibur to a devil... I do not think I will be able to return to the Church... I need a place to live.\" Xenovia reasoned with Naruto, and he couldn't help but chuckle nervously at that. Naruto couldn't help but chuckle at how he seemed to be a magnet for nuns and other followers of God. Did he have some kind of unique scent to him that made the nuns want to be around him or something, because it seemed like that.\n\n\"Yeah, if you need a place to stay, then you can stay with me. A free room just opened up anyway.\" Naruto said, knowing that Asia was currently moving into his room so a free room was indeed going to open up. Of course, this was going to affect his sex life with Asia, because now he would have to make sure both Koneko AND Xenovia were out of the apartment before he could even up that damn score. Naruto was okay with being behind Asia in the score, but he would be damned if the reason he was behind her was that he sneezed and lost control. That was a low blow, but he was sure that he would be able to even it up again without being interupted.\n\n\"I see, then thank you very much.\" Xenovia commented back to her, and she would be handing him Excalibur Destruction as well, but he only had two hands to carry swords with so she couldn't really hand him a sword that didn't have the power to change shape into a rope to tie around the arm. Honestly, she was also placing her faith in him to survive Shion fortelling his death, because if he died then she would have all the swords. If he survived though, he was proving that he could defy fate, and by extension show that he wasn't like those that weren't worthy to use one of the four great Holy Swords.\n\nShe herself was the wielder of the legendary Durandal, another of the four great holy swords. She was happy with her own sword, so she had no such need for Excalibur, nor did she had the desire to take wasn't rightfully hers. She did believe that the sword belonged to Naruto though, because he was not only the only person she felt she could put her faith in to use it wisely, but he was also the holder of the strongest of the Excalibur fragments. He simply had the most claim to the completed version of the sword.\n\n\"So, any idea how to find the fragments nya?\" Naruto asked with a his brow furrowed in frustration, before Naruto slapped himself for not thinking of it before. Naruto held his hand out into thin air, before he summoned four red magic circles out of nothing. Placing two hands on the hilts of the swords he was carrying, he placed both Excalibur Blessing and Excalibur Ruler into the Sealed Dimmension that he used to hold some of the things that he found, but Koneko didn;t want in the apartment. Naruto then grabbed the rope and turned it into the same sowrd form that Xenovia used, before he placed it into the third circle so that it vanished into his Sealed Dimmension. Xenovia got the message and took the banadges off of her larger sword, before she tossed it to him like it weighed nothing. Naruto caught the sword, before he started to sweat drop when he realized something.\n\nThis sword was taller than him, and weighed more than him.\n\nPlacing this sword into the Sealed Dimmension as well, he sighed in relief at four fragments of the Excalibur sword being in his possession. Xenovia was a smart girl, she knew that when she saw him place the sword into a sealed zone that she should have him place Destruction into one as well. That way if they were defeated, the nobody would be able to get them and reforge Excalibur without breaking into Naruto's sealed dimmension, but that was impossible without knowing the phrase, having a key to it, or being Naruto.\n\n'Hmmm, now that I won't be able to return to the Church... I wonder what I should do when this is all over. I know I will be staying in this city, but what am I going to do with myself?' Xenovia thought with a frown as the two of them started to walk together to try and pick up the signature of the holy swords. Xenovia looked towards Naruto for a moment, and she remembered the ease in which he was able to take on a Sacred Gear user. He didn't even have to try, meaning that he was both skilled and was packing a lot of raw power under his belt.\n\nA very good combination, and with his looks and potential for the future she would have to admit that he would be a fine catch.\n\nA fine catch indeed... and just like that Xenovia was pretty sure that she just found what she wanted do to with her life.\n\nA FINE catch indeed.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t51. Chapter 51 Before a Fight\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"This doesn't sit well with me, and where is Naruto?\" Rias commented while biting her thumb as she tried to think of a way out of her current situation. Last night, the very same night that she had heard from Asia that Naruto never returned home, she had been faced by one of the founding members of the group of Fallen Angels known as the Grigori. The ten winged Fallen Angel that had once led God's armies into battle against Devils, a war mongering Fallen Angel that went by the name of Kokabiel. She had been told that if she didn't bring her peerage to the school ground tonight, then Kokabiel would destroy the entire city and everyone in it without mercy. That was something that Rias couldn't allow to happen, because that would not only mean the lives of thousands innocent people being lost, but also another Great War between the three factions would be started as well.\n\n\"This is worrying, but we don't exactly have the time to search for him.\" Akeno advised Rias with a frown of her own across her face, while the others started to look around in the hopes that Naruto would just appear out of thin air like he always would when he wanted to surprise people that were looking for him. Akeno knew that Naruto was off doing something, but like Rias she had no idea just WHAT he was doing. They were all surprised when moments later the door opened to reveal Naruto coming through the door with his orange battle outfit already on his body. Koneko was the one that was the most surprised, while some of the others seemed to be less so. Rias sighed in relief at Naruto finally showing up when they needed him, while Yuuto stood up from his seat and walked over to Naruto and gave him a thankful pat on the shoulder.\n\n\"Glad to see you again bro.\" Yuuto stated with a small smile on his face, while Naruto looked at Yuuto with a raised eyebrow. He wasn't sure if this was a change for the better or not, but he was sure that something strange was going on. Looking at Rias with an expectant look on his face, she sighed before smiling at him. She was glad that Naruto was back as well, before she frowned and looked at him sterny.\n\n\"You couldn't have come back at a better time Naruto, the situation has taken a turn for the worse since you left.\" Rias stated with a light smirk on her face now that their secret weapon was back with them. She felt better going into a fight with her star player with her, and now that her star player had returned she wouldn't hesitate to face off against Kokabiel now.\n\n\"Okay, what has happened and why nya?\" Naruto asked with his arms crossed, knowing that something strange had happened in the time that he had been with Xenovia searching for the Holy swords. He was sure that he had felt the presence of two relativally strong Fallen Angels in the city, so he had wanted to make sure that Rias and the rest of them were okay. He could even sense these two Fallen Angels just above the gym area of the school at this very moment. Something was off about this, and he was sure that Rias would be more than happy to explain to him just what was going on here. She seemed like she would have told him even if he hadn't asked her to tell him.\n\n\"Things have gone to hell in a hand basket since you had left, and now Kokabiel has openly declared a challenge to us. If we don't accept his challenge, then he will destroy the entire city and everyone in it.\" Rias said with a small amount of her desire to kill the fallen angel leaking through her tone, while Naruto looked around the room so see who all was going to be going in on this fight. Naruto knew Rias, and he knew that anyone she was taking into a fight would be in this room with them so that they could get ready for the fight to start. So far the only people he could see in the room were Rias, Akeno, Koneko, and Yuuto. That was a rather small fighting force to use to go up against Kokabiel, but he could see why the others weren't being included into this fight.\n\nBlaze just wasn't ready for a fight on this level, and neither were the others that recently joined the peerage. None of them had any skill when it came to working with everyone as a team, while Rias had been training the others for years in working together. Naruto was sure that Rias had them doing something important, but he was also sure that Gasper would be of some use during the fight... never mind, Gasper was hiding in his box, meaning that he would be in the fight just like the rest of them.\n\n\"Where are the others? What do you have them doing?\" Naruto questioned, and Rias nodded grimly.\n\n\"They aren't ready for this kind of combat, so I sent everyone else to Sona to help power the barrier that will be placed around the school. The more people fueling the barrier, the stronger it will be. Asia has sent me a text with your phone, and she will be coming to the battle as well so that she can heal us if we get hurt.\" Rias explained to him all of the people that would be battling, and while Naruto didn't like his fiance getting into this fight, he would admit that it was her choice on what she wanted to do. If Asia was going to come help them by fighting or by healing, then that was her choice. He would respect that, but he would also be making sure to protect her with his life should the need arise. Naruto was sure that she would be able to survive this with all of them working together, but he couldn't help but worry about her placing herself in harms way for others. He didn't want to lose her, but he didn't want to make her feel like he was trying to control her life either.\n\nHe had never been in a relationship before, so this was all new to him.\n\n\"That sounds good and all, but when are we suppose to meet in battle nya?\" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow, before Rias looked away slightly, knowing that he wasn't going to like the answer to this question. He had come just in time, because as of this moment they only had ten more minutes of getting ready for the battle.\n\n\"We have ten minutes left before we have to meet him behind the gym.\" Yuuto said to Naruto, knowing that Rias would try and break it to him a bit more gently that he wasn't going to have much time to prepare. Naruto sweat dropped at how little time they had to prepare for the battle, even though Naruto didn't need to prepare anything now that he had all he would need with him at this moment.\n\n\"Just like a bully beating a nerd.\" Koneko commented dryly, noticing that behind the gym seemed to be the number one spot to meet somebody for a fight when at a school. That or on top of the roofs, but that seemed to be a spot for rivals to settle things against each other. Koneko stood up and fixed her dark blue boxing gloves on, and she looked at the pink cat paw designs on the top of each one to make sure that they were without flaw. She wanted her hits to hurt as much as possible, so she was going to wear these to bring the pain to anyone unlucky enough to get close to her. She already had a list of places that she would be aiming for to inflicyt the most pain, and they were the center of the body, the face, the neck, the crotch, the eyes, the crotch, the nose, the crotch... yeah, she wanted to maul somebody in the crotch. If they were male, then she would be making sure to rip something from them.\n\nNaruto and Kuroka had both always told her that if she should ever get in a fight with a male, so always go for the delicates to make things even more painful. Of course, they told her that for different reasons. Koneko was a little bit shorter than Naruto, so it was easier for her to go for crotches than it was for her to go for heads... in a way she was going for the head no matter what option she picked. Though, Naruto had told her if she ever went for HIS crotch when they sparred then he would be getting back at her in the most humiliating way possible. The last time he had humiliated her he had stuck his finger in his mouth, before he placed it in her ear in front of people.\n\n\"I take offence to that, I never went for nerds. I was Naruto-kun's exclusive bully.\" Akeno said with a teasing smile, and for a brief moment Naruto felt like hitting her. He really felt like hurting Akeno, because she had always told him that she bullied everyone as a kid. Now that he was hearing that she only bullied him, and Rias on occasion, the urge to hit her made itself known to him.\n\n\"You bullied me as well.\" Gasper complained lightly, while Naruto sighed in relief when he remembered how Akeno would tease and make fun of Gasper. He wasn't the only male that had been teased without holding back, she also teased the hell out of Gasper as well... but Gasper had some more lasting affects to the teasing. While Akeno had given Naruto a fear of pedobear, she had given Gasper a good amount of fear for new females and females in general.\n\n\"You made fun of my boobs.\" Koneko commented with a twitching eye, while Naruto raised an eyebrow at Akeno. Koneko was sensative about her small chest, and now he knew the reason why she was so self-conscious about it. Sure, she had a small chest, but no matter how much Naruto tried to tell her that she wasn't flat she just wouldn't listen to him. She seemed to think that A-cup and flat chested were the exact same thing. Of course, Koneko was almost to a B-Cup, but she seemed to be of the opinion that anything smaller than a C or D cup was considered flat chested these days... when her friends were boob monsters like Rias and Akeno it was easy to see how that was her opinion.\n\n\"You made fun of anime.\" Rias said with narrowed eyes, while Akeno giggled to herself at how she seemed to have bullied everyone in the room. The only one that didn't have a bully story to talk about was Yuuto, but that was because nothing Akeno could do would really get to him.\n\n\"Well, then I guess I will need to try some more to become your personal bully eh Naruto?\" Akeno asked with her eyes closed in a way to show that she was slightly serious about this. Naruto face palamed, before he decided that it wasn't worth it. It really wasn't. Rias looked at the clock on the wall, before sighed sighed and stood up.\n\n\"Lets head out and show Kokabiel that he shouldn't mess with the Gremory family!\" Rias said with a contagious smirk on her face, and soon everyone in the room hads matchings smirks on their faces as they got up and started to head out of the room.\n\n\"I'm going to cut him to pieces.\" Yuuto said with a small smile on his face as he stood behind Rias with a sword in his hand, before he was joined by Gasper, who had a nervous look on his face, but he seemed none the less determined to prove himself during this fight.\n\n\"His sack is going to be popped.\" Koneko stated in a monotone as she joined Gasper and Yuuto standing behind Rias, while Akeno just giggled at the sadistic method of torturing a male. SHe pitied any male that had to deal with an angry cat like Koneko, because she was sure that somebody was going to have their balls busted tonight.\n\n\"You guys are so weird nya.\" Naruto commented as he joined in, before they all started to head towards the battlefield as a group. As they were walking out nodody noticed as Naruto smirked very lightly behind them all.\n\nThis was going to be good.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the No Star (THEN) Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please! **_\n\n\n\t52. Chapter 52 True Excalibur\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**This chapter will confuse you, trust me.**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Teme...\" Naruto said when he saw the very same Fallen Angel that he had seen the night that he had killed Raynare, and this Fallen Angel was standing right next to none other than a middle aged black haired male wearing very expencive looking black and golding robes, his long black hair r parted around his long pointed ears, and his glowing red and yellow eyes staring down at the group from the sky with blood lust clear in them. Naruto actually completely ignored Kokabiel ijn favor of staring into the onix eyes of the familiar Fallen Angel.\n\n\"Dope, to think that our match would come this quickly. I have to say, I am pleased with this outcome.\" The duck haired Fallen Angel stated with a smirk on his face, while Naruto glared at the male for the insulting nickname... while completely ignoring his also insulting nickname he had used on the other male. Though, the Fallen Angel didn't seem to care about his nickname as he landed on the ground and stared at the group that was going to face him, before he glanced up at Kokabiel out of the side of his eye. Kokabiel smirked when he saw the look, before he waved his hand and neared towards the ground himself with a soft thump of his feet touching the dirt.\n\n\"You know this guy?\" Yuuto asked Naruto with a curious expression.\n\n\"Never met him before in my life, but he looks like a bastard, hence the nickname bastard.\" Naruto stated with a deadpan tone, while everyone that heard him sweat dropped at how much of an idiot Naruto could be sometimes. Even the Fallen Angel teen looked at Naruto like he was an idiot, before he smirked at him and pointed to his forehead with his thumb like he was going to introduce himself. He got most everyone's attention, while the others looked towards the golden glow that was happening behind Kokabiel and the mysterious Fallen Angel. Ris and Yuuto were the only ones paying any mind to the golden glow in the background, and what they saw... was NOT pleasant.\n\nSeven Swords... the seven Fragments of the Excalibur sword were all inside of one of the most complicated Alchemy formulas that Rias had ever layed her eyes on. All seven swords were placed in a circle fashion, and there were two people standing outside of the circle. One was a person that was covered in cloaks so that his face wasn't visible at the moment, while the other was a white haired male sitting on the ground with his priest robes getting dirt on them while he waited for whatever was happening to get finished. Rias gulped lightly as took a step back out of impulse when she went through a mental list... Ruler... Destruction... Mimic... Blessing... Rapidly... Nightmare... Transparency... all seven of the fragments were inside of the formula, meaning only one thing.\n\nThe group from the Church had failed to keep their swords safe, and now they were in the hands of the enemy.\n\n\"Never met me before... how stupid of you Dope. When you slaughtered that low class Fallen Angel I was there, you saw me. Anyway, I guess it is time for me to make my own introduction... My name is Sasuke Himejima, the first born child of Baraqiel and Shuri Himejima... the pleasure is all yours.\" The now named Sasuke Himejima greeted, and everyone looked towards Akeno with a shocked look... and were greeted with an extremely shocked look on her face when she heard the names of the parents that this boy had.\n\n\"You have an older brother!?\" Rias was the one that let out a surprised shout, while Akeno just looked at Sasuke with shock... shock that slowly gave way to anger and hatred that bloomed inside of her chest.\n\n\"No, my only family was my mother... and she is dead.\" Akeno stated with a frown on her face as she denied even having a small amount of family left in this world. Sasuke himself was chuckling, before he shook his head with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"I agree fully, we are not family... no devil scum will ever have the honor of being related to me. Even more so a weak little girl like this one.\" Sasuke said with his arrogance showing when he compared the radiant power of everyone in the field. He knew for a fact that this girl came nowhere close to the level that he would need for even a small challenge, while Akeno glared at him and charged up a bolt of lighting at her fingertips before she pointed her hand at him. Sasuke only held his hand out with closed eyes as the lightning grew near to him, and less than a second after the lightning was shot at him it came in contact with his hand.\n\n\"I refuse to be related to Fallen Angel scum as well.\" Akeno muttered with her killing intent filling the area, while those that were sensative to it like Gasper whimpered under her large desire to go on a murderous rampage. She growled even further though when the lighting started to vanish quickly, before it started to seperate into smaller bolts of lighting. The smaller bolts shrank and started to fade away into Sasuke's hand, and when the attack was over Naruto frowned when he felt a rise occur in Sasuke's energy levels.\n\n\"Akeno, don't use magic on him... he absorbs it and adds the magic to his own reserves. He is skilled with lighting, just like you Akeno... don't give me that look.\" Naruto commented without needing to see Akeno giving him a glare for comparing the two of them so quickly. Naruto had just been making a comment that this guy was skilled with lightning, skilled to the point that he had a near immunity to it.\n\n\"Kill them Sasuke, kill them an once Excalibur is reforged it will be yours.\" Kokabiel stated with a demented grin on his face, before Sasuke sent the man a bored look. Sasuke frowned for a moment, before a sick grin started to form on the boy's face. A sadistic grin from somebody that loved to inflict pain and suffering upon others, a grin that Naruto knew all to well thanks to his friendship with Akeno, and seeing her inflict as much pain as possible on Stray Devils before killing them slowly. Sasuke turned back towards the group, before he glared at Naruto for some reason. Naruto glared right back, before Sasuke's eyes started to change from onix to blood red.\n\n\"Sacred Gear: Copy Wheel Eye... I don't need YOU to tell me to kill people Kokabiel. I have had my special eye on the Nekoshou for awhile now.\" Sasuke stated as he brought out all six of his wings, wings that were as black as charcoal. He blurred out of view faster than most of the people on the field could react, but Naruto twisted on his feet quick enough so that he was able to grab Sasuke's wrist just as a blade completely made up of lightning stopped two inches away fromn Akeno's eye.\n\n\"Rias, kill him now nya.\" Naruto ordered his King quickly, and she nodded and crossed her arms as reddish black flames of power appeared in front of her. She swung her arms out, and a large ball of her power came crashing towards Sasuke with amazing speed and power. The red eyes boy just narrowed his eyes, before he glared at the Power of Destruction that neared him. Swinging his lightning blade he cut right through the attack by using his Holy Element and defeating her Unholy power with it. The ball of destruction split into two balls, and Naruto was forced to let go of Sasuke so that one of them wouldn't hit him or Akeno. \"Gasper, freeze him in his place now!\" Naruto shouted out, before he grabbed Akeno and jumped out of the way with her breasts pressed up against the side of his head when Sasuke's blade of holy lightning was swung at her again.\n\n\"O-on it! Eep!\" Gasper shouted as he closed his eyes when he saw the frightening image of Sasuke glaring at him before he could even try and use his Sacred Gear to freeze Sasuke in time. Gasper didn't even see the Holy Lightning Blade soaring in his direction before Koneko grabbed his hand and yanked him out of the way of the attack just as it sailed where he had been. She ducked under a slash headed towards her, before she got onto the ground and used a sweeping kick towards the Fallen Angel. He rather easily jumped over the slow and easily avoidable kick, and then he noticed Koneko smirking at him lightly... so lightly that only his now keen eyes were able to pick it up.\n\nHis wings went back into his body just as Yuuto came swinging his swords at them moments later, and the blond boy now passed by Sasuke without doing any kind of damage to the Fallen Angel.\n\n\"Akeno, do me nya.\" Naruto said from the air as he came soaring down at Sasuke, who was forced to stay in his place when Koneko used his hands to grab onto his ankles and physically hold him in place with her superior strength. Sasuke grit his teeth, before he saw Akeno shoot some kind of snow powder towards Naruto's fist... and Naruto's fist froze into a block of solid ice just as he let his fist crash into the top of Sasuke's skull and bust the ice open. Sasuke was stunned by the blow for half a second, before he swung his blade at Koneko's hands and MADE her let go of him long enough for him to jump far away from the ground that he had engaged in cloose combat with.\n\n\"Not so cocky now, are you Fallen Angel-san.\" Rias commented as she sent another blast of her Power of Destruction flying towards the back tracking Sasuke. The Fallen Angel frowned when he saw the completely eradicated areas that her power touched. It wasn't like the ground was scorched, more like that it was completely disintigrated just by coming in contact with her cursed power.\n\n\"So this is the Power of Destruction hailing from the Bael family... I had heard of the Gremory Heiress having this power, but I did not think she would have the skill to use it properly. This is an impresive group.\" Sasuke commented dryly as he absorbed another bolt of lighting sent at him by Akeno when he wasn't looking. He glared at her for a moment, before he briefly felt his body freeze up... he curged his power through his body and he regained perfect control once more. Looking for the source of his loss of control, he found the origin to be the small Dhampire girl... possibly cross dressing boy.\n\n_Boost!_\n\n\"Huh?\" Sasuke asked, before he jumped out of the way when a red and yellow blur rushed passed him and started going towards the group that he had just escaped. He frowned when he noticed that the blur stopped and was now standing in the middle of the group... it was the same nun that Raynare had been after... a nun with both the Boosted Gear and the Twilight Healing. If he remembered right, then this girl was also the one to defeat the Phenex girl... Asia Argento... her name was starting to become somewhat infamous in the Underworld for her victory over a Pure-Blooded Devil that hailed from the Phenex family.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late... I was Boosting myself up a little before coming here.\" Asia said as she entered the group, before she noticed that nobody was hurt yet and sighed in relief. She had been hoping to save up as much energy as possible and use it all just in case people needed healing. She had already boosted herself to her complete limit of number of times her body could handle the Boost, and with her magic boosted to such an extreme level she would be able to heal almost any wound as easily as touching it and thinking about it healing.\n\n\"Good for you, but stay back... this guy has been going for kill blows. You can't heal yourself from decapitation, and we might need you to heal us. Stay out of the fight if you can.\" Rias stated lowly so that Sasuke and the others couldn't hear her giving Asia orders. Naruto heard her, but he refused to comment on it for fear that his personal views on the matter would come out. He didn't want Asia in this battle at all, or in any battles... he just wanted her to stay safe.\n\n\"Boosted Gear and Twilight Healing, Rook Nekoshou, slut, Sword Birth, Forbidden Balor View, Gremory with the Power of Destruction, and a small Queen Nekoshou... you have your work cut out for you Sasuke. Freed! How long until the True Excalibur is finished!?\" Kokabiel asked with a smirk on his face as the white haired priest turned around and looked towards to the cloaked figure for a few moments and some muttering was heard between the two near the Excalibur blades.\n\n\"A few minutes, five minutes at the most.\" Freed said calmly, and Kokabiel raised an eyebrow at how calm the usually insane priest was acting, before he shrugged it off as the calm before the storm. Freed would be going ape shit on the devils when he had the first chance to.\n\n\"Then... fast!\" Sasuke said, before he had to fly into the air to avoid a group of powerful bubbles that exploded and destroyed everything within a twenty meter zone around the bubbles. Rocks and shards of concrete were sent flying into the air as a dust cloud was kicked up, and Naruto took the opening to run into the dust cloud. Sasuke flapped his wings and stayed in the air, before he placed his hands together and formed a bus sized Spear of Light above his head. Throwing the spear into the dust cloud, a yellow explosion rocked the ground and detroyed forty meters around the dust cloud. The dust was cleared right away, and it showed that he had missed big time... Naruto himself appeared moments later with Yuuto and Gasper being held by his arms.\n\n'When a person's views are turned upside down, those with a Sacred Gear gain something called-' Naruto started to think as he threw Yuuto towards Sasuke, while he landed on the ground with Gasper. Yuuto placed his hands together, and both white and black energy started to gather in his hands.\n\n\"Balance Breaker: Sword of the Betrayer!\" Yuuto shouted as he created a sword that had a very long blade that was a little longer than Yuuto was tall, and the blade was wider than Yuuto's head with a long black streak with red writing going down the middle of the sword. The sword was without a real guard on it, and it was giving off not only the energy of a Demonic Sword... but also the very same every of a Holy Sword. Yuuto sped right passed Sasuke and swung his sword, while Sasuke created a Sword of Light and swung it so that he blocked Yuuto's sword as he passed by. Naruto smirked when a cut appeared on Sasuke's arm as his Sword of Light broked and faded into light dust, showing that Yuuto's sword was the stronger of the two.\n\n\"Both Holy and Demonic... a Holy Demonic Sword.\" Naruto said with a smirk as he jumped and caught Yuuto, before he dragged both Gasper and Yuuto out of range as the area they were at exploded when a pissed off Sasuke destroyed the ground they had been on with a large spear of light. Naruto smirked again, before he threw Gasper towards Sasuke... with the Dhampire boy screaming in horror then entire time, while Sasuke summoned a spear of light and prepared to stap Gasper through the head. Sasuke clinked his teeth though when a stream of the Power of Destruction came roaring through, and forced him to fly out of the way or face being injured in a painful way. Gasper turned into a flock of bats and started to move around, before he quickly reformed in the middle of the group and out of harms way for the moment.\n\n\"Just like cockroaches...\" Kokabiel commented as he watched Sasuke struggle to land a good hit against the groups good teamwork. Showing that the six winged Fallen Angel had a ways to go before he could handle a group of people that fought this well together. He compared them to cockroaches simple because when you thought you were about to kill one, another three come out and distract you long enough for the one to escape. That was why Kokabiel summoned a Spear of Light of his own and took aim towards Rias, knowing that her Power of Destruction was one of the bigger threats. Throwing the spear, he watched with a sick grin as Rias didn't notice the spear until it was far to late.\n\n\"Buchou!\" Koneko shouted out as she noticed the spear of light coming from Rias' blind spot, then with her shout everyone was able to turn just in time so see Naruto grab Rias' hand and yank her out of the way as the spear of light sailed passed them and destroyed the Gym building behind when in a yellow explosion.\n\n\"Thank you Naruto, you saved my life.\" Rias commented as she and Naruto landed on their feet not far away from the crater that had once been a building.\n\n\"No problem nya, but don't let your guard down again.\" Naruto stated with a frown on his face, because he knew trhat if that attack had hit then war would be a promised outcome when Sirzechs stormed the Grigori hunting for heads. Right now, Rias' life was the most important one to protect, because her life was the one that would decide if another Great War between the three factions restarted. If Rias died, then it was pretty much all over even if they killed Kokabiel, so protecting her would take priority over their own lives.\n\n\"Speak for yourself.\" Sasuke commented as a lightning coated fist burst through Naruto's heart, and blood escaped out of Naruto's mouth as the deadly blow was landed on him. Sasuke now had everyone's attention as he threw Naruto's body to the side, and seconds later he created a large Light Spear and completely destroyed Naruto's body before anyone could try and heal the damage down to him. The crater in the ground being all that was left when the dust from the attack settled down... and without Naruto being in the crater.\n\n\"No...\" Koneko whispered with unbelieving wide eyes as she gazed into the crater, while the others looked on in shock as well. Nobody could believe that the most powerful of their group had been taken out in one move like that, while Asia collapsed to her knees with tears going down her face freely as she looked at where Naruto had been.\n\n\"One less devil to deal with, so whose next?\" Sasuke asked with a smirk on his face, before everyone... even Gasper, was glaring death at him. Not even Asia was able to resist the need to glare death at Sasuke for what he just did, while a black and red aura sprang forth around Rias as she started to talk under her breath and a red circle appear in front of her with her family crest in the middle of it.\n\n\"I'm gonna kill you...\" Everyone turned their heads when they heard Gasper's muttering as darkness started to form around his legs, and he stared at Sasuke with dead eyes. Sasuke looked at Gasper for a moment, before he saw the darkness swirl and grow in mass as it headed straight towards him... and everyone watched in shock as Sasuke's eye started to bleed as the darkness was set on fire with flames as black as night. The darkness then grew larger until it swallowed up the black flames and devoured them, while Sauske narrowed his eyes at the strange power without worrying to much over it.\n\nHe cut a bolt of lightning in half and jumped out of the way of the darkness that threatened to swallow him hole, before he kicked Yuuto away without a care... the biggest threat to him was gone now. He was easily able to track their movements and counter them or dodge them. He appeared behind Gasper moments later with a spear of light ready to impale Gasper through the head, before the boy turned his head and glared at Sasuke with darkness surging up and trying to wrap around Sasuke to consume him. Clicking his teeth again, he had to use his full flight speed to escape getting killed by the darkness.\n\n'I killed one, but they all seem to have gotten stronger!' Sasuke thought in anger as he flew higher to run away from a huge amount of Power of Destruction that roared passed him and destroyed a section of the magical barrier in the sky, before the entire barrier just completely fell apart. He glared down at the darkness and the Power of Destruction that was threatening to kill him, before he noticed lightning being mixed into the power Rias was using to enhance it even further.\n\nEveryone winced when a BRIGHT golden light filled the area, and a powerful Holy aura filled the entire field.\n\nExcalibur was complete again.\n\n\"Freed, why don't you use Excalibur to join in on the fun and slay some devils with Sasuke?\" Kokabiel asked with a wide grin on his face when the white haired priest grabbed Excalibur and started to walk towards Kokabiel with a wide smile on his own. He was completely silent as he made his move towards the devils, and just as he passed by Kokabiel... he turned on his heel and rushed forward and stabbed Kokabiel... right through the heart.\n\n'Traitor!?' Sasuke thought in shock, before Freed pulled the sword out and swung the blood off of it while the confused Kokabiel fell to his knees in shock over the fact that HE had been betrayed by his most loyal servant. He glared up at Freed weakly and saw the insane priest giving him a dark look... then he looked at the weapon that had stabbed him in the chest. He glaed at the Holy Sword being held by the white haired male, the golden blade of the sword with thin and about 4 feet long. The handle and guard of the sword was shaped like a fancy cross, with a red gem in the bottom of the handle and the middle of the guard. The edges of the blade were lined with silver, and it had an unearthly glow about it.\n\n\"Sorry, but slaying Devils isn't in my interest... nya.\" The white haired male stated with a voice that matched perfectly... with the white haired boy that had been killed not long ago. The figure of the pirest lost a lot of height, and started to get thinner as the face of the priest started to get a little more round as three whisker marks appeared on each cheek... the eyes of the man turned dark yellow with slit pupils, and the straight white hair started to stick up in a spiked up mess. The clothes around the shorter figure became amazingly loose, before they were ripped off so show that the now revealed Naruto was wearing the Church battle clothes... with black pants... under the clothes, even if the pants were unbuttoned.\n\n\"What!? I killed you... a clone!?\" Sasuke shouted in frustration, while Naruto stuck his tongue out at Sasuke before he swung the True Excalibur and beheaded Kokabiel while the man was bleeding out of his chest... he didn't have much time left in hisdm anyway after being stabbed in the heart. Kokabiel's body was turned into golden dust as he was completely destroyed, while Naruto mentally cheered for himself at his brilliant plan working.\n\n\"Yep, when me and Xenovia over there-\" Naruto said as he pointed towards Xenovia, who stripped off the MANY cloaked she had been wearing to imitate an older male figure. He then swung Excalibur again in a downwards motion, and a fifty foot wide crater appeared under the blade the second the tip of the blade hit the ground. Cracks were lined in the crater, and Naruto landed on his feet inside the crater after testing the raw power of a light swung from Excalibur. \"Well, when we were looking for the other Excalibur Fragments, we came across a old man and this Freed guy... well, I took out Freed and stole his clothes. The Xenovia and I used my Excalibur Ruler to get the old man to tell use the Formula he was going to use on the Excalibur Fragments, and give us the seal for it. Then I disguised myself as Freed and took all the Fragments here, while Xenovia disguised herself as the old man and the rest is history Nyahahahahaha!\" Naruto finished with a laugh, while Rias and the others looked at Naruto in shock at the cleverly thought out plan that would allow...\n\n...\n\n\"You were the one that kicked my ass!?\" Yuuto shouted in shock as he pointed a finger at Naruto, while Naruto chuckled sheepishly and tossed Excalibur from hand to hand.\n\n\"Yep, I kicked your ass and made you learn a lesson. I have also been disguised as a member of the Church, have repaired he Church, and have been teaming up with and feeding the Exorcists that have been looking for the Excalibur Fragments. I have had a VERY active week nya.\" Naruto chuckled out when he wasn't holding back his laughter, and when that was reigned in he looked at the shocked faces of everyone... and he almost broke out in laughter again while Xenovia walked up next to him with her arms crossed under her chest and a smirk on her face.\n\n\"Almost nobody expects to get stabbed in the back, so somebody of Kokabiel's arrogance wouldn't expect somebody loyal to him to be the one to kill him. He had his guard dropped, and that was his final mistake.\" Xenovia explained the best part of the plan, while Sasuke sighed and his Spear of Light vanished as he cancelled his power.\n\n\"Then I have no reason to stay, I will see you later Dope.\" Sasuke stated as he flew off with the moon in the sky lighting his escape, while Naruto smirked up at the flying figure.\n\n\"Yeah, you better run you chicken headed chicken nya.\" Naruto commented dryly, before he turned his face and was met face to face with Rias' chest as she wrapped him up in a fierce hug with tears falling down her face that were falling from her joy to see him alive. Naruto sighed, before he wrapped and arm around her as well and allowed her to pull him into her chest. He then gulped when he felt the stares of two girls piercing him to his very soul, so letting go of his King he looked over to see Koneko, Gasper, and Asia sending him... looks. He had no idea what the looks meant, but he was pretty sure that he was in trouble.\n\nHe... was most likely on the couch tonight.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t53. Chapter 53 Old Bosses\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n'Otouto... I wish he would stop bringing strange girls into our home.\" Koneko thought with a twitching eyebrow as she left the the grocery store with a few bags of groceries hanging from her arms. Each bag was about the same size as he head, and she was carrying five bags on each arm with no trouble at all thanks to her superior strength. Since the arrival of the nun Xenovia, their food expenses had risen yet again... with Asia she could understand and accept her living under the same roof and eating their food. Koneko had pretty much given the girl her blessing to marry Naruto, and the two of them were trying to set a date and location for the wedding. Asia was nearly part of the family, and the girl was trying to find a part-time job to help out... but because she wasn't good at Japanese she was having some major trouble actually finding a job that would take her... kind or not, when you were trying to find a job in Japan, then it was best to have a good grasp of Japanese.\n\nXenovia on the other hand, had a perfect grasp of Japanese... her problem was the fact that she had almost no sense of decency or the ability to understand what was the time and place for her to say certain things. Her mouth had already gotten her into two fights since moving in, and one of those fights happened to be with a girl that had been stalking Naruto. Naruto didn't seem to care that much about stalkers, and normally he would just trick them into leaving, but Xenovia had instigated a fight by calling the girl out of the bushes and saying that her stalking was creepy as hell.\n\nNaruto was actually out working on helping Asia find a job that would need her English speaking skills, as well as helping her learn Japanese. Of course, Xenovia was out doing something at the recently repaired Church, and Rias was settling some kind of deal that she had made with Sona in exchange for the girl's help.\n\nTripping on her own feet, Koneko swung her arms to balance herself out. Though, in response to her regaining her balance all of the bags that she had bought went flying in front of her. Koneko regained her balance, and she was about to run and catch the bags, before she saw a quick moving thin item swiftly snap all of the bags out of the air in a matter of seconds before even a single bag could hit the ground. Koneko's dark yellow eyes opened wider in surprise when she noticed that she didn't sense a single bit of a devil's, fallen angel's, youkai's, or even an angel's aura coming from the person that had caught the bags. Her eyes watched as the swift blur came a complete stop.\n\nA walking stick, that was what had caught all ten of the bags before they hit the ground. An old fashioned hand crafted walking stick, and holding onto said walking stick was an... elderly woman in her late 70's... the woman had her eyes closed and she had a gentle smile on her face as she held onto the other end of the stick with a single hand. Her face was wrinkled, and her skin had a fair bit of sag to it from the woman's advanced age. Her hair was as white as the fallen snow, and wrapped up in twin buns at the sides of her head with two chopsticks sticking out of each bun. Her skin was light color, and she had a fair amount of darker spots on her skin. Unlike the people around them, she had on an old style chinese dress in the color red, with yellow dragons going on the sides.\n\n\"Careful now child, you wouldn't want to hurt yourself carrying all of these.\" The elderly woman said as if she wasn't holding onto the entire ten bags using one arm and a stick. Konekoi's eye twitched without her knowing, mostly because she was being called weak again because of her small size.\n\n\"I will be more careful... can I have those back?\" Koneko asked as she looked at the bags hanging from the older woman's stick, before she heard the sound of the woman laughing lightly with her other hand covering her mouth in a polite show of joy.\n\n\"Hahaha, young people these days. Always in the rush to hurry, and not taking the time to enjoy youth. Why don't you walk with me young one?\" The elderly woman asked kindly, and Koneko's eyes went to the bags of groceries before she noticed that the woman had something... unique about the way she was talking. Koneko looked up, before she looked around herself lightly to see if this was some kind of trap. Then she looked towards the woman again, before she nodded... frankly, she figured that she wouldn't be getting those groceries back unless she did go with the lady. She could always get them back with a little force, but that would ruin her reputation and by extension Rias' and Naruto's reputations. When the elderly woman started to walk into the other direction with the groceries all balances perfectly on the wooden staff, Koneko followed with her eyes trained on the woman to make sure that she wasn't some kind of shape shifter in disguise... yeah, when you had a brother that could freely control his shape, size, gender, and looks in general you got into the habit of looking for any signs of a person not being used to the body they were in.\n\nUnnatural foot steps, a constant motion that would show not being used to the length of the limbs, constantly correcting grip and the muscles jumping from trying to control the twitching of the joints.\n\nNothing, this older woman was showing none of these signs, showing that she wasn't a shape shifter taking the form of a elderly lady. Unless she had a perfect ability to get used to other people's bodies like Naruto, then this was a true older woman.\n\n'This woman... she walks with grace. Every step is measured without trying, and the air around her is even more peaceful and understanding than Buchou's... even in her elder age, she has aged like a fine wine... growing more wise as her age increase.' Koenko observed the humming older woman as she and Koneko walked through the streets, looking very much like a grandmother would when walking with her grandchild. That was the problem with white hair, you always looked like you were related to almost every older person with the same skin tone as you. Older people also seemed to like taling to a young person with the same color hair as them, or they would go on about how putting die in her hair was wrong... Koneko's hair wasn't dyed, but older folks though it was. In her defence, Nekomata and Nekoshou's hair usually came in the same colors as a cats fur. The main colors you would find on a Nekoshou were white, black, and brown. It was rare for a Nekomata to have any other colors of hair, while hair color stood out as a status symbol among their race.\n\nBrown haired Nekomata were on the lower end when it came to status, and not getting as much respect as other colors. If you compared them to Devils, then Brown Haired Nekomata were very similar to Low-Class Devils in power and potential. If your hair was brown, then it was said that your potential as a Senjutsu and Youjutsu user was a lot weaker than the other colors. Brown haired were at the bottom of the scale, and their abilities with Senjutsu and Youjutsu were the weakest among their race.\n\nBlack haired Nekomata were next on that list, and they got much more respect than other Nekomata. Of course, the shade of that hair also showed where their potental for Senjutsu and Youjutsu was. The darker the shade of black, the higher you ranked. Hair that was about dark grey was normally considered to the Middle-Class for Nekomata, while pitch black like Kuroka's was considered to be High-Class with the potental to gain power equal to that of an Ultimate-Class if they were trained correctly. These were the cats that usually partnered up with a Witch, and silently controlled them while training their skills. Kuroka herself ranked around Ultimate-Class because of her power with both Senjutsu and Youjutsu.\n\nFinally, the White haired Nekomata like Naruto and Koneko were the most valued among their species. They had the highest levels of potentail for Senjutsu and Youjutsu, surpassing even the potental that Kuroka had. Of course, their status as the more powerful breed of Nekomata known as Nekoshou made their potential even greater than before. To Nekomata though, those with white hair were considered to be the same as High-Class or even Ultimate-Class. Kuroka had said that their mother had been a white haired Nekoshou, while their father had been a black haired Nekoshou. Meaning that among Nekoshou, Koneko and Naruto was at the top of the food chain and were among the most respected. They had the highest potental for mastering their Senjutsu and Youjutsu.\n\n\"Be careful, don't let yourself get distracted again.\" The elderly woman said with a soft smile on her face as she walked ahead of Koneko, who blinked with a small amount of pink on her cheeks out of the embarrassment of getting lost in thought.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Koneko asked suddenly, not wanting to be gone from home for too long when she was suppose to be the one to bring home the groceries today. She always got onto Naruto for taking forever, so she would be a hypocrite for being late as well when she knew that it was never truly Naruto's fault that he had a horrible sense of direction when walking in a city.\n\n\"Young people, it isn't about the destination child, but the trip you take to get there. I was thinking that maybe you would like the smell the flowers, or just sit in the park as feed birds... maybe even just get lost on the road of life.\" The old woman said with a matured smile, while Koneko groaned lightly when she realized that this woman wasn't going to give up on making her take her time. She followed the woman anyway as they walked into the park, and the older woman picked one of the flowers on the ground and lifted it up to her face as gave it a soft sniff. Koneko saw her place the flower in her hair, before she turned to Koneko with a smile. \"My Grandchild used to make me a crown of flowers everytime she came to visit, she was always a spirited little tyke. Got into so much trouble, and she would always play in the dirt just because she could... she was a very nice girl.\" The old woman said with a light air to her voice.\n\n\"Was?\" Koneko couldn't stop herself from asking, and the lady nodded.\n\n\"She died last year when she caught a bad illness, but even on her death bed she gave me the most gentle smile as I placed a crown of flowers on her head. Her parents died the year before, so she had been living alone... car crash. She would come over to visit as much as possible, and it was sad to see the embers of her flicker and die... but she died happy, and I guess that is all I can ask for.\" The older woman said with a gentle smile again, and Koneko couldn't see her eyes so she just assumed that the older woman had a sad look in her eyes. Koneko could understand why as well, because she just admit to her children and grandchildren dying before her. It was painful for a parent to see their children die, but she didn't seem to be moping either.\n\n\"Do you miss her?\" Koneko asked without thinking, not having her parents she had never known what it was like to talk to one about these kinds of things... it was a humbling experience for her to say the least.\n\n\"Yes, I miss her everyday. I miss her parents as well, and my husband. Of course, death isn't goodbye, just so long for now. I will be reunited with them one day, sooner or later I will see them again. Until then, I will carry their memories in my heart, and enjoy life.\" The old woman said as a small bird landed on her finger when she stretched her hand out, before she brought the bird to her face and it flew away at the sudden movement. The old lady smiled gently as she watched the bird fly away, before she laughed to herself. \"Of course, I also want young people to enjoy youth as well... we only live this life once. We have to be strong to survive, but that doesn't mean we can't just relax... and smell the flowers.\" The old woman said as she took the flower from her hair and gave it to Koneko, who took the flower and smelled it before giving it back to the older woman.\n\n\"You are very graceful...\" Koneko commented with a small amount of suspicion in her eyes, something the older lady didn't notice when she chuckled kindly at Koneko.\n\n\"Why thank you child, your words are very kind. My husband and I were martial artists in our youth, and it shows even now. It does my heart proud to see a good martail artist these days... today's fighters aren't the best around when compared to in my time... of course, I did see this young man training in the park a few weeks ago.\" The old woman said with a slight sigh at the end of her sentence, and Koneko nodded lightly. The park was a space where it wasn't odd to find the occasional person from one of the dojo's in town training their body.\n\nKoneko was forced to stop when the older woman gently placed the bags on the ground, before she turned towards Koneko with the same smile that she had when she had first came in contact with Koneko.\n\n\"Well, I have kept you long enough. Thank you for spending some time with this old relic, you can take your bags and leave if you want to.\" The old lady said just as Koneko started to reach towards the bags on the ground. Koneko snapped back when the wooden staff crashed into the ground in front of her hand, before she looked up at the old woman with an annoyed look on her face. Said old woman just looked back at her with a small smile on her face, but something was hidden deep in those wrinkles. \"Oh, and here I thought you wanted to leave. Your bags are here when you want to leave, just take them and go.\" The old woman said with the same smile... that was pissing Koneko off.\n\nKoneko ran towards the bags and prepared to use her smaller body, and Youkai/Devil speed that naturally surpassed that of a humans to get the bags. She blinked in surprise when the old lady just lightly stepped on her foot, before she used her stick to tap Koneko on the shoulder and sent her tumbling into the ground when she completely lost her balance. She looked up at the old lady in disbelief, not because the lady was strong enough to knock her over, but because she had been able to predict and counter her without using very much energy at all... most of the energy needed had been provided by Koneko with her movement.\n\nShe flipped herself up, before she ran towards the bags again and jumped over the old ladies foot when she looked like she was about to trip her. Koneko was surprised though when the old woman just used her left hand and placed it on Koneko's gut, before she placed her right palm on the back of her head and flipped Koneko through the air so that she landed on her back a few meters away from where she had been flipped. Koneko flipped back onto her feet, before she stayed low to the ground and burst towards the bags again. She was inches away from grabbing one of the bags, before the wooden staff caught Koneko by the back of her shirt and lifted her in the air, before she was sent back down to the ground on the other side of the woman. She looked up at the sky again in annoyance, before she saw the older woman looking at her with the same damn smile.\n\n\"I am surprised child, you don't seem to want these bags very much. It is nice to spend time with such a kind young girl though.\" The woman complimented with a smile. Koneko just huffed and got back to her feet, before she rushed at the older woman with the intent of knocking the wooden staff out of her hands long enough for her to grab her bags. Koneko blinked in surprise when instead of her fist knocking the staff from the older woman's hands, her own wrisyt was grabbed, and the force of her own punch was used to flip her through the air... again, before she was sent rolling against the ground as dirt covered her clothes and skin.\n\n'I am starting to hate looking up at the sky.' Koneko thought when she came to a stop, and found herself looking up at the sky once more. She quickly stood back up, before she ran at the older woman again without holding even a small fraction of her speed and strength back when she made a grab for the bags. Koneko blinked in shock though when all the older woman did was use her staff to tap the back of her knee, and Koneko herself was sent tumbling across the ground again when she lost her balance and covered herself with even more dirt as she rolled across the ground. She smacked her face against the wall around the park fountain, before she actually flipped INTO the water of the fountain with a large splash.\n\nKoneko was soaked to the bone with water as she stood up again, but she was happy her skin wasn't covered in dirt... she hated the fact that now the dirt was pretty much mud now that she was wet.\n\nBeing wet sucked as well, but not as much as the mud.\n\n\"My grandchild loved playing in the water as well, but I don't think the park water fountain is the best place for that.\" The woman said with a light chuckle, and Koneko almost lost it while she jumped out of the fountain and ran towards the old woman with his hand inches away from the bags once again. Only this time, she didn't even know what happened when she found herself looking up at the sky again.\n\nShe was getting schooled... by a human. If he found out, Naruto would never let her live it down that she was getting her ass handed to her on a silver platter by an old lady. So with new determination, she hopped to her feet and rushed the bags. Instead of running though when she got close, she started to slide across the ground for a few feet as she got close to the bags, only her her hand to be smacked away by the same wooden stick as before. She made a grab with her other hand, but that was smacked away by the other end of the staff when the woman spun her staff with her hands, a light smile on her face.\n\n-2 Hours Later-\n\n'The hell?!' Koneko thought as sweat dripped down her face and she looked at the unflawed old lady with pure disbelief coloring her features. Koneko clothes were completely covered in rips and tears, dirt as well, while her skin was drenched in sweat from her constant attempts to get her groceries back. Her hair was completley coated with a layer of dirt, making her white hair as messy as it had ever been before. She hadn't been able to grab even a SINGLE bag in the two hours she had been trying to get them away from the older woman. She hadn't even touched one of the bags, and this old woman wasn't even trying that hard.\n\nShe wasn't all that strong when compared to Koneko's strength, but she was leagues ahead of Koneko when it came to skill. If Koneko ran, then she would know just what to do to make her lose her balance and fall to the ground, or she would use Koneko's power and light weight against her and send her flying with simple moves. Koneko had her hands on her knees and she was panting like she had been training with Naruto, and frankly she would rather have been training with him. Sure, he would hit her, but it wasn't as frustrating as losing to an old human woman.\n\n\"Well, this was all fun, but an old lady shouldn't be standing to long. Not good on the joints, so I hope to find you again. If you ever need to find me, I spend a lot of time at the park.\" The old woman said as she walked away from the groceries and started to walk at her own pace to leave the park, and before she knew it the old woman was gone while Koneko was staring in shock. She went over and looked at the groceries with a bitter look... after failing to get these for hours, she didn't feel happy about getting these just because the old woman had to leave. It was like she was still losing, even though she got the bags.\n\nThis was a bitter victory... no, this was still Koneko losing. She looked in the direction that the old lady walked into, before she frowned. The old woman was a very good fighter... maybe, just maybe she would be willing to train her. Koneko had to admit, that she could learn a thing or two.\n\nShe just found herself a martial arts teacher, and she would need to talk to that old woman again.\n\nBut first she had to get the groceries home... she was so late.\n\nCrap.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t54. Chapter 54 Those that Stand on Top\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Holy crap, am I in trouble?\" Naruto asked when he saw four very powerful people just sitting down in his apartment. The second Naruto saw all four of them together, he was sure that he had done something very wrong recently. He tried to remember if he had done anything that would need for all Four of the Satans to appear in his living room, and he started to sweat when he realized that there was a list of things that he had been recently up to that could have landed him in thje dog... cat house. Of course, it hlped his mind that he was on good terms with three of these people, and two of them adored his cuteness.\n\n\"Naru-tan, Sera-tan has been dying to see you again!\" A young looking girl with lon black hair tied up in twin tails, and deep violet eyes. She had a slightly childish body, but with breasts that could rival other large breasted females. The strangest thing was the fact that she was wearing a pink magical girl outfit with black gloves, and that cut off at the midriff to show off her stomach... and in her hands was a pink magical girl wand. Yes, this girl was none other than Serafall Leviathan, who used to be the heiress of the Sitri family before she lost that title when she gained the title of Leviathan and became one of the Four Satans after the last Great War. Right now though, she was pretty much punishing Naruto by apparently trying to choke the life out of him by smooshing him into her boobs with starry eyes. \"Sona-tan told me all about the Rating Game, and you did GREAT!\" Serafall said as she hugged Naruto tighter to her body... with his body struggling to get air back into his lungs.\n\n\"Serafall, please let him go. Promoting him won't do any good if he dies, and finding more potential like him will be too much work.\" A handsome young man with an extremely laxy aura about him stated, and this tired gentlemen was none other than the ex-heir to the House of Glasya-Labolas, another of the 72 Pillar families, and this man was yet another Satan that used the title Asmodeus... his name was Falbium Asmodeus. He was in charge of the Underworld Military Affairs, even if he is one of the laziest people to ever exist... and Naruto wasn't counting that lazy kid that appeared in his dreams... what was his name? Shikamaru Nara or something like that, well, it was something in Japanese so he would have to spend time thinking on his dreams later.\n\n\"Oh just let her have her fun, Sera-tan and Naru-tan don't see each other very often.\" Sirzechs Lucifer, formally of the Gremory, stated with a small smile on his face. He still remembered how Naruto stumbled off a cliff and landed right on Serafall, and from there a great friendship was born from the fact that Serafall was instantly taken with how cute the boy was... Sirzechs literally had to hold her back when going and declaring war on the Phenex family when she heard about them making a deal with Naruto being the one to get married instead of Rias. She had frozen a large chunk of land that day, and that land was still frozen to THIS day. She had a bit of a temper on her when you knew what buttons to push, and finding out about things like that late was one of the things that pressed those buttons.\n\n\"I just want this over with, then I can get back to the lab and work on something new.\" The fourth person stated, and his mysterious aura about him made him appear even more devilish than the other Satans in the room. This was none other than Ajuka Beelzebub, the former heir of the Astaroth family, AND he was the creater of not only the Evil Piece system, but ALSO the maker of the Rating Games. When Naruto had first met this man, Ajuka had immediantly taken a vial of his blood for research reasons without even asking Naruto for his permission, frankly that was why Naruto didn't like needles at this moment. Whenever the two ever crossed paths, Ajuka would jab Naruto in the neck with a needle and take some of his blood so that he could research and try to gain a deeper understanding of the Nekoshou race... yet her never jabbed Koneko or Kuroka... total dick move on this guy's part.\n\n\"Promotion?\" Naruto asked when he finally got himself out of Serafall's breasts, with her pouting at the back of his head for not getting some more cuddle time. Naruto easily ignored the pout... his own pout far outclassed it anyway. He just didn't like to use it because it was so cute that his reputation might jnever recover from it.\n\n\"Yes, you have already stacked up an impressive number of feats. You have two dragons as familiars with one of them being the rare Sprite Dragon, and the other being a member of the Five Great Dragon Kings, a dragon with Satan Level powers. You were able to defeat multiple ex-priests, a Fallen Angel in battle without injury. You defeated a prominant member of the Phenex family in two on one combat, with you being the single party. You tricked and killed Kokabiel, who was going to start another Great War, by using your brains and the True Excalibur... which you own.\" Falbium stated without a care about what was happening. which was true, but this was an exciting thing happening. Being Promoted to a higher rank by Military acomplishments was one of the hardest and rarest ways of being promoted. Not only did you have to have an impressive list of feats, but you needed to go ahead of 3 of the 4 Satans, and one of those Satans HAD to be Falbium himself because of his control over the Military affairds. Naruto was the first devil in a LONG time to have all 4 Satans agreeing with his promotion, and having the recomendation of the Gremory, Phenex, Sitri, and Bael families. All of which are members of the 72 Pillar families, and all of themn ranked very high among the Pillar families.\n\n\"When you put it like that... but Tiamat only agreed to be my familiar because I was a cute boy.\" Naruto freely admit to one of his feats not being nearly as impressive as it sounded. Tiamat would only ever answer to his summons if he did something so cute it was humiliating, if he acted cute for her, or if his life was in real danger at the time of the summoning.\n\n\"Okay, not as impressive, but you still have a Satan level Dragon as a familiar. Of course, that still doesn't change the fact you are are going to be given a Promotion... Ajuka-kun, if you would please...\" Sirzechs said as the Beelzebub Satan stood up with a nod as he walked over towards Naruto with a box in his hands. Naruto looked confused for a few moments, before the Satan stood in front of Naruto and opened the box just below Naruto's eye level so that he could see something that made his eyes widen by a large amount. The first thing he noticed was the color red, and that there were sixteen items inside the box all inside of little cushions so that they stayed still.\n\nKing - Queen - Rook - Rook - Bishop - Bishop - Knight - Knight - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn - Pawn\n\nA set of Evil Pieces, meaning that they were promoting Naruto to a rank that stood as a High-Class devil. Naruto was going to become the King of his own Peerage, and a small smile worked over his face at the fact that he now stood as one of the Reincarnated Devils that had actually managed to become a King. Of course, he was still the Queen of Rias' peerage, but now he was ALSO a King of his own peerage. He wasn't just a Queen, he finally had a manly title instead of most of his titles focusing around Queen... or Princess in the ones that Akeno had taken to giving him.\n\n\"Naruto Toujou, from this day forward you are no longer a Baronet of the Middle-Class. On this day, you now stand at the noble rank of Margrave. Take these Evil Pieces, and become a King.\" Ajuka stated with a very light smirk on his face when Naruto took the box from him, and with a bright red glow the Red King floated in the air before it shot into Naruto's chest... the rest of the Evil Pieces started to glow as well as they reacted to the person that was now the King of that peerage. The second they finished glowing brightly, Naruto closed the box just as Serafall hugged him into her bossom once more and started to jump up and down with him crushed into her chest.\n\n\"Good for you Naru-tan, now you and Sona-tan are BOTH Kings!\" Serafall said with a loud giggle at the end of her sentence, while Naruto wished he could be somewhere else right now. He didn't mind being in between her breasts, that part of this was just fine, but he was sure that he was going to need to find the people he wanted for his peerage as soon as possible. He already knew who he wanted as his Bishop and Rook, while he and Blaze had changed their minds about him being traded. He had decided that he would rather stay with a certain somebody that was in Rias' peerage, meaning that he had actually found a romantic interest in Kalawarner like Naruto had first suspected... much to Naruto's joy, Blaze and Kalawarner actually seemed to be in a secret relationship that they were keeping secret from everyone around them. Naruto knew because Blaze had informed him, but had asked him to keep it a secret from those around him.\n\nKyokan was going to be his Rook for sure, with her Giantess/Cyclops strength already being far above that of the average Rook, she would gain an amazing amount of strength from being a Rook. Not to mention her defencive powers would be increased to montserous levels. Her problem was that she would still be as slow as ever, so even with that strength she would have trouble actually landing hits on smaller opponents or fater opponents. She was going to be the Tank of Naruto's peerage, somebody that could tank through blows like they weren't affecting her, and then when she hit you... bye bye. That was the end of the story, if she got to you then you would be wishing that you had been faster. Naruto was tempted to use BOTH of his Rooks on her just so that her abilties would be even further increased, but that temptation was rather small.\n\nKuroka... she had once been offered the place in another devils' peerage, but she had refused because she had wanted to raise Naruto and Koneko. Naruto already knew that with her skills, she would take up a total value of 6 Pawns, meaning that he could use his Queen, 6 Pawns, 2 Knights, or 2 Bishops on her. Thanks to her area of mastery he was going to go Bishop for her and increase her massive reserves even further with two Bishops. He was sure that she would make him a great Bishop, and her skills in both Youjutsu and Senjutsu would without a doubt be great.\n\nXenovia was actually waiting for him to rank up so that he could turn her into a devil under his command, but he wasn't sure if he should use a Rook or Knight for her. He was leaning towards combining the speed of the Knight with the destructive power of the Durandal, but then she would be slower than other Knights because of her large sword and style of fighting resolving around power over skill... yeah, he was most likely going to go the path of the Knight for her. He had a feeling that she would much rather be a Knight than she would be a Rook, the sound of being a Knight would appeal to her swordswoman side much more than being a Rook.\n\n\"Oh, and Naruto... your slave has almost finished her maid training under Grayfia. She just had a few more courses left before she is ready to serve you again.\" Sirzechs said in refernce to the fact that Naruto had sent Mittelt to the Underworld so that she could undergo maid training from the best maid around. Naruto nodded at the statement, because it would be nice to have a maid to clean his home while he was out doing something, or doing Asia. He would rather be doing Asia than cleaning an apartment in his free time. Yeah, he still needed to get that score evened up as soon as possible. He could live with Asia having a bit more stamina in bed, but he was naturally a person that wanted to be the winner.\n\nGrinning to himself while between Serafall's breasts, it finally hit Naruto.\n\nHe was a High-Class Devil now!\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t55. Chapter 55 Assasinating Memories\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"This was... unexpected.\" Naruto said while looking away from Kyokan, the very first member of his peerage to be turned into a Devil Hybrid like himself. When he had told her about his promotion, she had demanded that he turn her right away. She wasn't the most willing to wait for something that she wanted, and she wanted to become a member of his peerage as soon as possible. That was why he had known she would want him to contact her as soon as possible once he had his Evil Pieces, and that was what he had done. The second that he had the chance, he had come right over to her house and told her all about his promotion to High-Class. She had ben excited, very excited... and by that Naruto means that she picked him up and pulled a Serafall by pressing him into her massive cleavage. Seriously, he was afraid that he was going to die today by being choked out by large breasts. Kyokan made AKENO of all people look average chested, and unlike other people her huge breasts looked more normal on her because of her height.\n\nApparenlty, she had recently hit ANOTHER growth spurt, thankfully she didn't grow in the bust all that much. Bad for her though was that when a Cyclops hits a growth spurt, it only takes a few weeks for the growing to be finished. They grow quickly when they hit a spurt, and the amount that they grow depends on how concetrated their blood is... being a Giant and a Cyclops made her blood more concetrated than her mothers surprisingly. That would mean that her height was no long a tall 6'9, something that was far taller than any other woman he had ever met besides Kyokan's own mother. Now Kyokan stood at an even more impressive 227 centimeters, also known as about 7 feet 4 inces tall, making her without a doubt the tallest woman he had ever seen in his entire life... hell, she was the tallest humanoid being he had ever met as well. Apparently, her unqiue blood had made her an even quicker grower, and even taller than both of her parents, who were both huge people as well.\n\nThankfully, her parents had assured him that this was the last growth spurt, so Kyokan would most likely be the largest girl in his peerage with her height at 7'4. It was good that she wasn't growing anymore, but now known of her clothes fit her anymore, meaning that she was going to have her dad make her all new clothes. Of course, that would mean that she would have to get her new measurements done for her. Something that had been unexpected because Naruto was the one that did it for her, she had requested it of him.\n\nBust... 160 cm - Waist... 72 cm (Slim when compared to height) - Hips... 119 cm (Also sexy when compared to height)  \nFinal result - B-160/W-72/H-119 (Height) 7 feet 4 inches\n\nKyokan... was a whole lot of sexy, and how she managed to make herself look so feminine with such a big body was something that surprised Naruto. Her arms were slim when compared to her body, showing that unlike her father she did NOT have the body of a body builder. Her womanly figure assured that it was impossible to take her for a man in any way... oh how he wanted to introduce Kyokan and Akeno so that Akeno would see that she doesn't have the biggest breasts anymore. The look on Akeno's face when she heard that would be priceless.\n\n\"Yeah, thanks for that. Because of these-\" Kyokan stated in annoyance as she grabbed her breasts and gave them a jiggle. \"Have always been more of a burden to me, and with them I can't see my Hip and Waist measurements.\" Kyokan finished as she let go of her breasts and they bounced again... and just kept boucing for a few more seconds before they became still again. Naruto seriously found it funny that Kyokan hated her own big chest, while many other girls would kill for her figure.\n\n\"Well, I guess I will let you get used to your new strength. I promised a few-\" Naruto said, before he and Kyokan jumped out of the way just in time for both of them to avoid a slash from... something that passed them right by for a split second. Kyokan put on a jacket to cover herself up, even though the jacket only came up the bottom of her ribs. She grabbed the curtains and ripped them, before she wrapped it around herself in a makeshift skirt and grabbed one of the forks on the table and stabbed it through the cloth to hold the skirt in place. \"-Your dad is going to be pissed at you, he ordered those from France.\" Naruto commented dryly for a brief moment, before they both noticed the blur move towards the table. Naruto couldn't help but raise an eyebrow when he saw... a girl.\n\n\"Friend of yours?\" Kyokan asked as she studied the girl with her single eye, before Naruto shrugged.\n\n\"Nope, most of my friends don't make it a habit to try and cut my head off at first glance.\" Naruto stated as he looked at the girl, who was holding up a picture and comparing Naruto to the picture or something like that. Naruto took this as his chance to take a good look at the girl, and he saw that she was a young looking girl with pale skin... she seemed around Naruto's age actually. Her deep purple hair was braided in the back, and she had tired golden eyes... like she hadn't had enough sleep in awhile. She did have a smile on her face though, and she gave off an upbeat aura. She had on a white robe with a black inside, and the robe was rolled up so that it didn't go over her shoulder. She wore a simple blue chinese dress with no sleeves and long slits up the legs... with no her arms were long black gloves with yellow runes on them, and in her hand was... a child's imitation scythe.\n\nNaruto winced when he felt his lifeforce suddenly drop down by 4 percent, and he felt a stinging sensation in his upper arm from where her real scythe grazed him lightly. A small amount of his own blood dripping onto the floor... he had been cut with a scythe that had a cutsies purple skull on the end with double blades.\n\nNaruto healed his lifeforce quickly by absorbing lifeforce from his surroundings, and when he was back to full he saw her frowning slightly as she held the picture up to his face again.\n\n\"You don't have blond hair or blue eyes, are you really the guy that refuses to die?\" The girl asked with a soft, but upbeat tone of voice as she compared Naruto... to a Naruto with blond hair and blue eyes in the picture. Naruto crossed his arms lightly, before he started to twitch at how she had attacked himn without being sure that he was the guy that she was after apparently.\n\n\"It depends, why are you after me?\" Naruto asked, and the girl blinked before hopping down from the table and bowing to him very slightly. Naruto looked at thye confused Kyokan, who was repressing the urge to hug the girl in front of them when she showed herself to be small and cute... Kyokan had a thing for small and cute. It was part of the reason that she liked Naruto and Koneko, because she had a fetish for things that were cute and small. Being a big woman, she seemed to like being around things smaller than herself... or she secretely wanted to be small.\n\n\"I am very sorry for not giving an intro sooner... I am Bennia, a Grim Reaper surving under Lord Hades... I have been sent to steal your soul Naruto Uzumaki... Lord Hades has need of what is inside you... or something like that... Lord Hades wants the souls inside you... I have been sent to retrieve... the soul of... Madara Uchiha... that is sealed... inside... Naruto Uzu-\" Bennia stated before she collapsed face first into the floor, and she immediently started to snore. This showed that she must have been looking for Naruto for a long time, and had been doing it with very little sleep it would seem. Naruto chuckled lightly, before he picked up the girl and tossed her over his shoulder while holding onto her scythe with his other hand.\n\n\"Grim Reaper of Hades eh? Greek God... friend of yours Kyokan?\" Naruto asked sarcastically, since Kyokan was Greek herself it just showed a fair amount of turning around her own words from earlier. She puffed her cheeks out at how he was able to do that, before she looked at Bennia for a moment.\n\n\"Not a clue, but if she was sent by Hades then you have a God after your life... who is Madara Uchiha?\" Kyokan asked, before Naruto stood completely still when he remembered something.\n\n_Madara's Prison_\n\n\"Madara is a person that is sealed inside of me it seems... and apparently the God of Death has a bone to pick with me because of it.\" Naruto said, before he grit his teeth and was about to use his hand to grip his skull... before he forced that to stop when he remembered he was holding the girl's scythe in his hand. For a brief moment, Naruto felt a flood of something enter his mind... and images poured in with whatever had entered his brain. He pictured a man with black hair and red eyes, his face cracked wearing red armor... this man summoned something blue around himself and summoned forth a large meteor that was as big as a mountain.\n\nThen Naruto pictured the same man, but his face was no longer cracked and his eyes were purple concetrated rings. His hair was a very light red color with a tint of gray, and his skin had grown paler. He now wore a strange white and black cloaks with magatama on it, and in his hands was a black ball... the man was floating in the sky. The black ball in his hands became multiple black balls and soared towards different locations... the very ground soared into the sky and became almost moon sized meteors... at least a dozen of them in number soaring towards the ground intent on destroying everything.\n\nThen Naruto saw the image of his own hand colored black and orange as a black ball appeared in his hand, before it grew bigger and gained four orange shuriken-like edges growing out of it.\n\n_Tailed Beast Ball Spiralling Shuriken!_\n\nThen, the image of his attack soaring up into the sky played in his head and the explosion that followed lit up the entire sky with the color orange and destroyed most of the meteors, while a blue samurai-like energy creature with somebody in it cut up the other one and started to head towards Madara.\n\nThen the images stopped playing in his head, and he gasped when all of the images stopped after one last image appeared in his mind... the image of a woman with pale eyes and a red eye with concentrated black lines with commas in it.\n\n\"Sealed inside of you?\" Kyokan asked with a narrowed eye... eye because of the fact she only had one to narrow in the first place.\n\n\"Yeah... I'm not sure how, but I have a feeling that it has something to do with somebody named Kaguya... The Rabbit Goddess... a Primodial being with unrivalled power...\" Naruto thought with a groan as he winced again, but this time no new rushes of anything went into his head. Kyokan looked at him for a few moments, before she accepted his words at face value. She was sure that he had a reason for saying them, so she would commit them to memory. She knew Naruto well enough to know that he was starting to act a bit out of character... he hadn't said nya the entire time he had been talking. Something was wrong, or he was forcing himself not to say his verbal tic at the moment.\n\n\"I'll remember that... on a side note, we better scam before my dad finds out about the curtains.\" Kyokan said as she picked up Bennia from Naruto's shoulder and placed her on her own shoulder as the two of them made their way out of her house. She was sure that she was in for some serious shit for taking the curtains and ripping them, but it had been a spur of the moment thing for her. She was NOT about to go into battle while only wearing a bra and panties that were ready to snap at any moment... seriously that was like being promised the full nude experience.\n\n\"So... this girl sounded pretty bitter about this 'Lord Hades' stuff. You think that guy is an asshole or something nya?\" Naruto asked the actual Greek, because he wasn't sure what was Hades' deal with him since he sent a girl after him. She would know much more about Greek Gods and Goddesses than he would.\n\n\"Hades is the God of the Dead, you could say that he hates having things taken from him. If you have a guy that should be dead, and a powerful one at that, then he will use you to gain more power... of course, he is also arrogant.\" Kyokan said as the two of them started to walk through the streets with Bennia on top of Kyokan's shoulder... they must have been a strange sight to see because people were staring at them... of course, they may just be shocked at the huge size difference... or just Kyokan's size alone. A 15 year old boy standing at 4'7 and a 16 year old girl standing at 7'4 must be a strange sight to see.\n\n'... She is my height opposite... I am 4 feet and 7 inches... while she is the exact opposite at 7 feet and 4 inches. That is kind of funny when I think about it.' Naruto thought as he took his mind off the fact that a God was trying to off him. It wasn't a very pleasant thought to think about, so he wasn't going to think about it. Naruto looked at Bennia snoring and drolling on Kyokan with a smile on her sleeping face, before he nodded to himself. Getting info out of her wouldn't be too hard, and he was sure that she wasn't working for somebody that was very understanding of failure. That would mean that since she failed, she would have nowhere to go. Naruto reached up to Bennia, before he placed his hand on her thigh and closed his eyes... sensing and memorizing what her species energy signature felt like, he assured himself that he wouldn't be caught off guard by a Grim Reaper again. Now that he had her signature memorized, he would be able to sense any other similar signatures much easier.\n\nOh crap, Koneko was SO going to get onto him for bringing home another girl... and this one even tried to kill him. She was going to question him so hard, and then his time on the couch would be extended even more. Wait... with how Koneko was acting when she came home Naruto was pretty sure that she was going to be very distracted. Every night Koneko came home covered in sweat and dirt, and she just collapsed the second she got into the apartment. Naruto was going to test his theory, because in moments they were able to walk up the steps to hi and Koneko's apartment and he opened the door...\n\n\"What the hell?\" Naruto asked when the first thing he saw the image of Xenovia chasing around Asia while both girls were naked and covered in soap bubbles... yeah, that was an image that he was going to remember for a long time. The image of two wet girls running around and bouncing as they chased each other... the fuck?\n\n\"Oh come on, you have to tell me what it felt like to have sex.\" Xenovia stated as she chased around Asia in the nude, and Naruto slowly closed the door before he turned around and started to walk away.\n\n\"Okay, things that have happened today... hot a promotion... first peerage member... first attempt on my life... and now my fiance is getting chased around while naked by a hot naked girl that is asking what sex feels like... I'm going to Yuuto's to question Bennia.\" Naruto stated with Kyokan following after him, nodding slightly as she walked. Naruto felt his phone vibrate, before he opened it so that he could see that he got a text from Rias.\n\n_Stray Devil in the city... kill it._\n\nThis day was a great day.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n**The Harem... is a secret... Naruto's peerage... also a secret.**  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t56. Chapter 56 The Queen of a Kitten\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Congradulations on your promotion Naruto-kun.\" Rias said when she saw Naruto inside the club room the very next day. Rias had heard all about Naruto's promotion from her older brother the night before when he visited her next, and while she wasn't exactly surprised that he had gone straight to Kyokan and the other people he might have planned on making members of his peerage. She would have to say that a strong girl like Kyokan would make a great Rook, it was to bad though that Kyokan didn't agree to becoming one of her pieces... she could understand the desire to not want to become a member of somebodies peerage when there was a better option available to you.\n\n...\n\n\"Naruto?\" Rias asked again when she only saw the back of his head sticking out from over the couch, so blinking at how he was ignoring her for whatever reason she walked around the couch... before blinking when she noticed that there was a girl sitting across from Naruto. A girl that she had never before seen in her life, and she was just staring blankly at the world around her like she had no thoughts in her head at all. Her eyebrows raised by a large amount when she saw that the girl's pupils were... glowing. Not the iris that showed she was using a power, but the very pupils of her eyes were shining bright blue, meaning that Naruto was currently inside of her mind using his Nekoshou's Evil Eye. Turning around so that she was facing Naruto, she saw that his eyes had turned blue and were glowing with dark power. She had no idea who this girl was, but if Naruto was using this on her then that would mean one of three things.\n\nOne, this girl had tried to kill Naruto, and he was going to be spending an AMAZING amount of time mentally breaking her with untold amounts of pain where even death was something he controlled. Seriously, for every minute in the real world 3 hours passed in the world created by Naruto's technique, the dream world that he controlled even though he was inside somebody else's mind. If she had done something bad enough to warrent him to use this to break her, then Rias didn't feel sorry for her. She had seen the results of what she would call the Mittelt Slave Project, the girl had been completely broken in about 5 minutes when this technique had been used on her. In real life, you could only torture somebody until they died... that wasn't the case here. Here, Naruto could even kill you and make you experience death, before painfully bringing you back and forcing you to undergo even more torture.\n\nTwo, this girl was being interogated in way that would save Naruto time and energy, and while she had tried to kill him it wasn't of her own choice. This would suggest that while this girl was an assassin, she was a good person and Naruto didn't want tp physically hurt her to get the information that he needed to make his choice. Then she would willingly say that she would prefer this option, because Naruto wasn't drifting closer to his own darkness like with the first option... this technique was labled the 'Evil Eye' for a reason.\n\nAll of anger, hatred, and other more evil emotions that Naruto had been repressing fully unleashed themselves when he used this move. Whenever he used it, he faced the risk of becoming more dark. If he overused this move, it was very much a reality that he could become evil. Of course, this was just a chance happening since Naruto could never fully erase the good in him, meaning that even if he became evil, it wasn't like he could never be his good self, just that the more evil part of him would be in control.\n\nFinally, Naruto and this girl were having a talk that was so private that the only safe place for them to talk was inside of her own mind. When inside her mind, and with the time difference, it was impossible for anyone to listen to their conversation. Even a mind reader wouldn't be able to make out anything they were saying to each other 1 minute equals 3 hours, which means that for a mind reader they would be hearing what Naruto and this girl were saying at super fast speeds, far to fast for the brain to process and understand as words. The mental stress would be far to much for even a mind reader to take in a span of seconds, while to the ones inside the techique their minds were playing in a mode that would make this safe for them.\n\nYeah, the third option would be the worst, because that would mean something bad or serious was going to happen. At least when somebody was trying to kill you that you knew what they wanted, because they wanted you dead. When somebody needed to be so secretive then you had no idea if they were being honest, or if the situation was worse than somebody after your life.\n\n\"Her name is Bennia.\" Koneko's voice explained to Rias, and the girl jumped lightly at having not noticed Koneko sitting next to Naruto with a plate filled with dango. Of of the sticks in her hand already while she ate the balls. Naruto had informed her of the attempt on his soul when she had gotten home from her now daily training with the elderly woman... the woman that still hadn't given her what her name was. Koneko was a little annoyed that her martial artts master refused to give out a name, but she could understand why a human of her age wasn't all of eager to give a complete stranger their name... even more so when the human was a elderly person that lived alone with no family members alive, and the person they were training was a devil capable of living up trees and houses with relative ease.\n\nKyokan had volunteered her abilities to kill the Stray Devil so that she could see where her new strength was at, so Koneko was given the task of making sure that nothing interupted the technique at the moment.\n\n\"I just came here to tell Naruto that today we are going to use the school pool to swim in when we are finished cleaning it... is why is the one of the Four Satans sleeping on the floor?\" Rias asked when she noticed that Serafall was sleeping on the ground in front of Naruto while scracthing her exposed gut. She was sure that all four of the Satans had left to go back to the Underworld by now, with her brother only staying because he was going to be taking part in Parent's Day... a day where parents and other adults in a students life would be able to walk their children and siblings studying and watch how they go about their school life. Her own parents were going to come, and her brother was coming as well with Grayfia.\n\n\"She has business with Otouto, and has spoken was being there for Parent's Day so that she can visit Sona.\" Koneko informed her neutrally, and Rias nodded. Serafall had a sibling complex just like her brother did, so it was only to be expected that she would be at the school for parents day. She frankly should have expected this, or at least prepared a room for Serafall to stay at during the duration that she would be here. It was only the polite thing for her to do, and it would tic Sona off so much to have her sister here for an extended amount of time. The two were complete opposites, because where Sona was slightly cold and a stickler for the rules, Serafall just loved doing whatever she wanted to do, and complete chaos was assured whenever she was around.\n\n\"What business does she had with Naruto?\" Rias asked when the first part of Koneko's statement hit her, and Koneko pointed to the table in front of Naruto... right towards the Queen piece sitting on the table. Rias blinked, not understanding what Koneko was refering to by pointing to the Queen piece of Naruto's Evil Piece set. Koneko sighed, before she pointed between Serafall and the piece again.\n\n\"Otouto has made a formal request for Serafall-sama to join his peerage as Queen... she said it sounded fun and responded yes... once Naruto is done with Bennia, he will be making Serafall his Queen.\" Koneko said in the same neutral voice, but even Rias could understand why Koneko was being more neutral than usual... one of the Four Satans, and the strongest female devil alive, was agreeing to become a member of somebody else's peerage, when she already had a peerage of her own. Not only was that something that had never been done before, but she was sure that Naruto hadn't been the one to get the idea on his own in the first place. He just wasn't the type of person to pick Serafall just because she was strong... well, they both shared a good amount of the same personality traits, so maybe they just thought it would be a fun idea to have her join him as his Queen.\n\n...\n\nThat is a scary thought, Serafall was already the strongest female devil alive, even stronger than Grayfia. Grayfia even had the boosted abilities of a Queen, and yet she still got her butt handed to her by Serafall when they last fought. That meant that Serafall on her own was able to defeat an Ultimate-Class Queen that is said to be on par with the Satan-Class. Now, if Serafall got the boost in power that becoming the Queen gave you she would become even more of a monster than she already was. Her strength would be boosted by untold amounts, she would be getting much faster than she had been befor, and her huge magical reserves would only grow even more in size than they had been before. Rias was sure that thought had already crossed Serafall's mind when she agreed, and now she understood even better why Serafall might have chosen to become Naruto's Queen... becoming the Queen of somebody was a great boost in power. It was also a huge honor to be considered the Queen of an influential person's peerage, and as the last male Nekoshou Naruto was a pretty important person.\n\n'Wow... not even a High-Class for a week and he is already adding a Satan to his peerage. Not only that, but he also has a Cyclops as his Rook if he already got to Kyokan... I have a feeling that Naruto will become one of the Top Ten in the Rating Games if he keeps things up like this.' Rias couldn't help but think as she whistled lightly at how Naruto was building up a powerful peerage quickly. Of course, she seriously doubt that Naruto would be taking the number one spot in the Top Ten just because he had Serafall in his peerage. He would be needing a few more powerful members before he would be able to claim the number one spot, but he insure that he wouldn't be losing against people in his own general age group... Rias was SO happy that Naruto was still her Queen. Being her Queen meant that he was unable to truly challenge her in a Rating Game, meaning that she would never have to face Serafall in a Rating Game... unless she herself was the challenger and facing Serafall's peerage.\n\nOh god that was a horrible idea for anyone to try, actually challenging one of the four most powerful devils alive to a Rating Game would have almost anyone scared... Rias was pretty damn sure she would rather humiliate herself by wetting herself in public, rather than fighing against one of those four monsters... if she had to fight any of them she actually might wet herself.\n\nSerafall could freeze Japan several times over rather easily if she wanted to, and here Naruto was adding to that already impressive power. It took Rias a few minutes to work up enough power top destroy a building, but in the same amount of time it took her to destroy a building, Serafall could destroy a city... suffice to say, she would rather take her chances fighting against an angry Naruto than going up against Serafall. She had seen Naruto angry before, and she was scared of an angry Naruto, which was why she compared things to going up against her Queen when he was angry. If she would rather fight Naruto at his scariest than do something then that just showed just how much worse something was.\n\n\"I'm also surprised... Otouto didn't even finish talking before she said yes.\" Koneko commented dryly, before she shook her head lightly when she saw the strongest female devil snoring loudly as droll fell onto the floor. She seemed to be having a good dream, or maybe it was just because she now had an excuse to be closer to two of her favorite people... her little sister and Naruto... Rias sighed when she felt the need to regret ever letting Naruto run off and meet Serafall. The two of them just... connected. Both of them were so childish when they wanted to be, while Naruto was just so lazy that he let Serafall do anything she wanted so long as he wasn't too humilated by it. Serafall, a full grown woman with a slightly childish body, had once begged Rias to allow her to keep Naruto. One of the Four Satans had begged her for her pet cat, and pouted when Rias didn't give her Naruto. This must be killing two birds with one stone, because now Serafall had a reason to come and visit her sister at school anytime she wanted to, as well as be nearby her favorite cat.\n\n\"I'm honestly not surprised, he has always been that kind of person that just crawled into a special place inside your heart. He just gives off this warm and fuzzy aura that makes you want to cuddle with him, like a big teddy bear.\" Rias admit after a few moments with a smile on her face. The fact that Naruto could make friends and bonds with almost anyone was something that she had always admired... even though right now he was sitting still and invading somebodies mind right now.\n\n\"I agree.\" Koneko said after a moments thought, since she had never really thought about what kind of aura Naruto had before. All she ever knew was that he was her brother, and she was safe around him. She was always more concerned with his scent than his aura, because auras weren't always the best way to judge a person. Some people learned how to fake their aura, so trusting an aura was a bad move... it was hard to do, but it was possible for people to use a false aura and mask their own with it. That, and she had been around Naruto for so long that she didn't really notice his aura all that much anymore. It was just there, so she never really took the time to think about it. Much like most people wouldn't think about how good the carpet they are standing on is, or the fact that they are breating the same air as somebody else. It was just something she didn't think about, and when she did it was always in a sort of passing. She never really gave it that much serious thought before now.\n\n\"Anyway, once he is done, tell him to gte a bathing suit and come to the pool... it is finally time he learned how to swim. You are going to learn how to swim as well Koneko... the fact that you are 15 and can't swim is kind of sad.\" Rias said with a teasing tone and shake of her head while shrugging lightly, before she caught the very light glare that Koneko was sending her way for the unneeded comment.\n\n\"If Otouto were in his own mind right now, you would be in pain for saying that.\" Koneko commented, before Rias shivered and rubbed her chin when a phantom pain rushed through her body. The last time she had tricked Naruto into the water, he had freaked out so bad that he had bashed his skull into her chin and sent her flying back onto land while he himself continued to freak out and drown in the water. He had been saved by Yuuto quickly after, but whenever Naruto, pain, and water were in the sentence she just had to flinch when she remembered how long it had taken to heal her chin. She had never known before how hard Naruto's head was, but now that she knew that didn't want to take another headbut anytime soon.\n\n\"Heheheh, of course So-tan... Sera-tan would love to wash your back for you.\" Serafall muttered in her sleep, while Rias raised her hands in the air in surrender and started to walk out of the room now that she had the perfect teasing material to use against Sona. There was no way that Rias wasn't going to use this new found teasing material against her rival/friend, not when Sona last teased her about how she had been slugged in the face by Blaze when he had first been reincarnated... seriously, what kind of guy slugs a girl in the face!? Of course, there were many different reactions to learning you had been brought back to life as a devil... Blaze just prefered to slug people in the face.\n\n\"I am going now... just for reference, how long as the Evil Eye been active now?\" Rias acted Koneko, and the girl started to look up at the clock on the wall for a few moments.\n\n\"About thirty minutes... so 90 Hours.\" Koneko said, while Rias felt a stab of pity for the girl if she had been option 1 on the list. Getting tortured for that long would break almost anyone when there was no limit to what the person torturing you can or can't do. Koneko looked at Rias for a moment, before she held up 1 finger... before she held up two more in addition. \"She tried to kill him, but not of her own will... he is just talking to her about who her boss is. He is trying to bring her away from the enemies side as peacefully as possible, but if a place where she isn't a threat to him or others.\" Koneko answered, and Rias sighed in relief at how Naruto wasn't mentally breaking this girl.\n\nStill, taking around 4 days inside of her mind to talk her over to his side showed that either she was very loyal to her boss... or she wasn't loyal and they were learning about each other during the time that they had spent. Another possibility was that she had a very weird mind, and Naruto was having some trouble ending the technique without hurting her. Rias say Naruto's eyes bleed yellow again, and the blue vanish from the girls golden eyes, before Naruto grabbed his nose once it started to bleed. Rias nodded to herself at him being okay, before she made her way out of the room.\n\nThe pool wasn't going to clean itself.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t57. Chapter 57 Learning to Swim\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Hell no, not happening, no way no how, fuck you!\" Naruto shouted out while wearing his swimming trunks as he was literally dragged towards the pool by his legs. His claws were marking the ground with scratched the entire way, and it was taking both Koneko and Akeno to pull him towards the pool so that he could begin his lessons on how to swim. The others were sweat dropping at how hard it was to get Naruto to do something that he clearly didn't want to do, but most everyone could agree with the fact that learning how to swim was pretty important to his survival should he ever get thrown in water.\n\n\"Ufufufufu, don't worry Kitten-kun, if you drown I will save you.\" Akeno said with a sadistic giggle in her tone, before Akeno shivered when she felt something VERY sharp press against her neck and stopped moving completely. She started to sweat and looked down to see a black scythe black with golden runes on it placed right against her neck, so turning her head to see who was behind her holding the scythe she almost jumped when she saw a realistic looking skull mask when green and yellow eyes staring at her. The mask looked so creepy and real that even Akeno mistook it for a dead person for a moment, before she noticed the ear-like protrusions coming from the top of the hood that the person was wearing, with bells attached to the hood itself.\n\n\"Issei, if you get me away from the pool... I will give you Rias and Akeno's B-W-H measurements, and a picture of them in their underwear!\" Naruto shouted out, not noticing the Grim Reaper that was threatening to cut Akeno's head right off her shoulders... oh, never mind, he did infact notice Bennia using her mask and scythe in it's more intimidating form to scare the hell out of Akeno so that Naruto would have the perfect chance to escape. Issei immediantly, and without any form of hesitation to think if this was a bad idea, jumped right out of the pool with perversion fueling his power, and scooped Naruto up with a determined look and stars in his eyes at the very thought of entering forbidden territory and gaining those measurements and pictures.\n\n\"Aye Master, those tig ol' bitties! The bitties will be mine!\" Issei shouted as Naruto situated himself on top of Issei' shoulders so that he could look down on everyone with his arms crossed.\n\n\"Why should I have to learn to swim, there are literally no oceans in the Underworld. You of all people should know that Rias, and that isn't considering that my territory is a forest.\" Naruto said with a sharp look towards Rias, while Issei and the rest of those that weren't in the know blinked at the strange way Naruto was talking about no oceans and territory. The rest didn't know it yet, because they hadn't been members of Rias' peerage long enough to take an extended trip to the Underworld, but members of the peerage of the current heir or heiress were usually given land within the territory of their master's family. The fact that the territory of the Gremory was able to cover most of Japan in size alone meant that they had a good amount of land to pick from.\n\n\"No oceans, how is that possible?\" Murayama asked as she stopped applying lotion to her skin so that she could enjoy getting a tan, it was kind of hard for devils to get sunburn, so they didn't have to worry about sunscreen as much... please not that this only applies to reincarnated humans and pure-blooded devils. Other species that take predominance over devil like Nekoshou can still get sun burned.\n\n\"We are just going to ignore the stranger threating me with death then?\" Akeno asked when the blade came even closer to her throat, and nobody even spared her a second glance.\n\n\"Not a stranger, I am Naruto's Knight Bennia.\" Bennia stated lowly, while Koneko next to Akeno nodded lightly in confirmation... while a completely different conversation went on on the other side of the pool.\n\n\"The Underworld isn't like the human world, so there are many things that are different. Thankfully, the pasage of time is the same so you don't need to worry about that. One day here is one day there, so no changes... but Naruto is right, there are no real oceans in the Underworld. Because of this, the Underworld has an overabundance of land, but unlike the Human World our population is much MUCH smaller. Even with the Youkai, Fallen Angels, and Devils in the Underworld, there aren't nearly as many people as you would think.\" Rias explained simply, and Naruto watched the others that didn't know about this gain a small understanding that they didn't have before. Even Blaze seemed to be nodding over at the other side of the pool... and even though he was in a swimsuit he was using this free-time to catch up on cleaning and maintaining his guns. Apparently, Rias had taught him a form of storage magic that he was using to keep his weapons in a locked space. It was a handy ability to be sure for a person that had enough weapons and ammo to fight in a war on his own. Now he could just call on his weapons whenever he wanted them, a handy little ability.\n\n\"Issei, Rias' measurements are B99-W58-H90... all in centimeters. I will have the picture for you delivered by my familiar to your home... and Akeno's measurements will be given to you when we leave the pool.\" Naruto whispered to Issei, and the boy started to nod over and over with a perverted expression of utter joy on his face. No doubt he was imagining what it would be like to squeeze such perfect breasts, and while Naruto couldn't help but chuckle, he was sure that Rias would be willing to let Issei play with her breasts if it would give him the motivation to complete more requests.\n\n\"I am your humble servant for the price of perversion Master.\" Issei muttered back to Naruto, and Naruto nodded while Rias looked over at them for a second.\n\n\"Issei, toss Naruto into the pool and I will let you see my breasts.\" Rias ordered Issei with a firm expression on her face, and the extremely conflicted look appeared over his face... tears started to fall from his eyes as he smiled with shaking lips. Naruto knew what was about to happen moments before it did, but as he was sent flying through the air towards the water Naruto looked at Issei sending him a look that showed that he was sorry. In the brief moments before Naruto hit the water he sent Issei a look and a thumbs up that told the boy silently that he understood why issei betrayed him.\n\nThere was a large splash, and everyone looked towards the pool to see Naruto splashing around like crazy... before he started to sink so that he was standing on the bottom of the pool and trying to swim up to the surface... and he was failing at an amazing level to even get his head to the surface of the water. Naruto then grabbed his throat when he started to run out of air, before he doubled his attempts to get out of the water as quickly as he could. He didn't know what it was about drowning, but whenever it happened he always had a lot of trouble thinking. It sort of sent him into panic mode, and when he was in panic mode he forgot a lot of the time that he had supernatural abilities that could get him out of the water.\n\n\"Naruto-kun, I'll save-\" Asia started as she ran towards the pool, before she was stopped by Katase and Murayama holding her back by lifting her into the air by her arms and walked her back to her spot.\n\n\"Nope, you stay right here.\" Murayama stated as she placed Asia on the ground, while Katase nodded with her friend. Rias had already told them to hold Asia back when teaching Naruto to swim, since he wouldn't learn anything if he was saved the instant he got into the water. Anyway, it wasn't like Rias would let Naruto actually drown, but he needed to learn how to swim, and swimming was something you learned by being in the water. They sweat dropped when Naruto was seen floating with his back up to the sky moments later, before he summoned his devil wings and started to fly out of the pool and landed on the ground next to the pool... and following his landing he started to spit out a large amount of water that had managed to fill his lungs in the time that he had been drowning.\n\n\"Hate... you... Rias.\" Naruto muttered, before he was pushed back into the pool by Gasper... who blushed when everyone looked at him in shock for actually pushing Naruto into the pool... before everyone sweat dropped when they noticed that Gasper was wearing a female swimsuit. The crossdressing Dhampire was wearing a regular dark blue bikini... it did not have to be stated that it actually looked good on the mostly gender neutral boy. The fact that if they didn't know that Gasper wasn't a girl they would have fallen for it was more than enough for Gasper to be allowed to wear a girl's swimsuit.\n\n\"Buchou told me to do it.\" Gasper stuttered out, while Kalawarner and Blaze snorted from their spots relaxing next to each other. Kalawarner was simply wearing a tank top and a bikini bottom, and had a book in her hands as she enjoyed the free time doing nothing.\n\n\"Birds have to fly, and fish have to swim.\" Rias answered when she noticed others looking back at her, and even in her white bikini she was crossing her arms under her breasts to the point that she was moments away from busting out of her own swimsuit. Naruto crawled out of the water gasping moments later with a glare in Rias' direction.\n\n\"I'm a land mammal Rias, not a bird or a fish.\" Naruto managed to say, before Gasper got ready to push Naruto back into the water. This time though, Naruto was ready for it and grabbed Gasper the second the girly boy pushed Naruto. He took this both into the water just as Rias smirked very lightly at Naruto's words.\n\n\"You fly like a bird, so you may as well swim like a fish.\" Rias commented when lots of splashing could be heard, and seen as water went everywhere from Naruto and Gasper struggling to get out of the pool. Gasper could swim, but Naruto was making it a point to make this as hard for Gasper as he could. Both of the boy went under the water, before everyone saw the water burst forth as Naruto came soaring through the air with something blue in between his teeth. Everyone blinked when they noticed that Naruto was smirking down at the pool while holding onto Gasper's swimsuit that was clenched in his grit teeth. Gasper came to the surface of the water moments later with a huge blush on his face before he submerged himself most of the way back into the water while covering his chest and crotch with his hands.\n\n\"Please give me back my swimsuit Naruto-kun, I need that to get out of the pool!\" Gasper begged with desperation in his voice, and Naruto smirked and crossed his arms without letting the bikini fall from his clenched teeth. Naruto used a hand to take the swimsuit from his mouth, before he let them hover above the water where Gasper was. Gasper jumped to try and get them, but Naruto lifted them out of Gasper's range again. Yeah, after being pushed in the water a few times he wasn't about to make this easy for Gasper.\n\n\"Seriously, my life is being threatened... why hasn't anyone bothered to remove this girl yet?\" Akeno asked with a large amount of nervous sweat dripping from her face, while Bennia just stared at her through the eyes of her mask.\n\n\"We don't like you.\" Kalawarner stated as she turned the page in her book, while Blaze nodded in agreement.\n\n\"I know I don't like you for a fact, and she hasn't made a cut yet so you haven't made a mess yet.\" Blaze stated right after Kalawarner, before he started to put back together one of his guns that he had finished cleaning. Akeno was chuckling nervously the entire time, before she noticed that Xenovia seemed to be missing from the group. She was sure that the Durandal wielder had been with them when they were changing into their swimsuits.\n\n\"I would, but she scares me.\" Issei commented from across the pool, while watching Naruto tease the hell out of Gasper by dangling the crossdresser's bikini in his face. Naruto blinked when he himself was tackled into the pool moments later when Yuuto decided to get involved in this, and he had enough time to glare at Yuuto before the resulting splash ended up putting all three men in a semi-wrestling match. Gasper was trying to get his swimsuit back, while Yuuto was trying to make sure that Naruto's didn't escape this time... Naruto was just trying to escape. He had already thrown Gasper's clothes as far as he could out of the pool when he was in the air, so Gasper had changed tactics.\n\n\"The fuck Gasper, did you just grab my ass nya!?\" Naruto shouted out when his head was above the water for a moment, before Gasper left the pool as quickly as possible with an orange cloth in his hands. Naruto blinked, before he looked down and noticed that he himself was no long wearing his swimming trunks... then moments later Gasper jumped back in the pool when he realized he was still naked... not before throwing Naruto's swimsuit over the fence so that they were both trapped in the pool without clothes.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm sorry... it was a spur of the moment thing.\" Gasper started to bow his head over and over, while Naruto twitched in annoyance. How could somebody stay mad at that teary eyes face?\n\n'He hasn't even noticed that he has learned to swim when he was fighting against the others to escape... Naruto always did learn best through fighting.' Rias thought as she layed out a towel for herself and got onto her stomach so that her back was facing the sky. Undoing the back of her swimsuit so that she wouldn't get any tan lines, she just sighed in relief. She was more than strong enough so that the sunlight didn't really annoy her like it would weaker devils like Issei and Katase, while for some reason Murayama was stronger than her friend. That, or she was just getting stronger faster than her friend. Only Naruto knew everyone's abilities by heart, and kept track of the rate they were growing more powerful. He was able to easily say how strong people were by colliding fists with them once, and once he did that it was almost impossible to hide your true abilities from him.\n\n\"You are an idiot Gasper, now we are both in the pool naked... I don't even care anymore.\" Naruto said when he noticed that he was actually swimming... and not drowning. It was important to mention the second part, but that was not the most important thing right now. Pointing the palm of his hand towards his swimsuit, and everyone blinked when it glowed orange before being transported to Naruto's hand so that he could put his swimsuit on again and get out of the pool. He could swim now, but that didn't mean he would have to like being wet.\n\n\"Not fair... totally not fair.\" Gasper said as he got deeper into the water to hide himself, while Naruto got out of the pool with his swimsuit now on again. He smirked at Gasper again, before he shook himself dry and layed down on the hot concrete so that he could fully dry himself off. He wasn't bothered by the heat all that much, in fact, it felt kind of good to Naruto to have the hot ground touching his body.\n\n\"Really? Nobody is going to do anything about this?\" Akeno asked again to try and get somebody to help her out, and everyone looked at her for a moment and they saw something strange about the girl that was apparently named Bennia. She was looking right at Naruto in wait of something, and Naruto rolled his eyes. This was actually a planned prank so that Akeno wouldn't be able to mess with Naruto too much right now. Bennia had been told that Akeno was going to mess with Naruto, so she was doing her job and making sure that the honor of her new boss was being protected.\n\n\"Yeah, keep her there for a few more minutes Bennia. I think this is hilarious nya.\" Naruto said with his smirk still in place, before he layed back and allowed himself to soak up the rays of the sun. Everyone blinked when a orange magical teleportation circle appeared above the pool, and Naruto sweat dropped when he saw the Phenex symbol right in the middle of the entire thing. He knew only one person that would try and teleport to his exact location from that family, or at least, one person that had a reason to do so. That was why when Ravel came out of the circle with a smirk on her face, he smiled very lightly when he saw that she didn't know that she had teleported right above a pool. Her smug expression changed into shock before she could even speak as she was dunked into the water before she could even properly react to the situation.\n\n\"Arg!\" Ravel shouted as she landed in the water.\n\n\"... Looks like chicken soap tonight.\" Koneko commented to her brother, while he nodded very lightly with a chuckle at yet another chicken joke that was being made about the Phenex family. Naruto saw Ravel climb out of the pool with a smirk, while Asia ran over and stood in front of Naruto in defence. Naruto raised an eyebrow at this, and Ravel looked like she was going to say something... before she started to spit out all of the water that had gotten into her lungs when she had gotten into the water. While she was distracting everyone, Gasper had taken this as his chance to escape towards the changing rooms.\n\nNaruto didn't know what Ravel wanted, but he was pretty sure it had something to do with him.\n\nHe could feel a headache coming on already.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Twin Tails - The Pure**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\n\t58. Chapter 58 The Snake that Bares Fangs\n\n_**Disclaimer: First Chapter**_  \n_**Story Start!**_\n\n\"Sera-tan is here to play in the... pool?\" Serafall shouted as she ran towards the pool in her school issued swimsuit, even though she wasn't a member of any school period. She started to slow down before she stopped at the edge of the pool when she noticed that she was the only person that was actually at the pool. The only other living thing at the pool was a pitch black cat with two tails just taking a nap on the diving board. She got on her hands and knees, before she stuck her head inside of the water and looked around the inside of the pool to see if everyone was playing an underwater game. She started to pout even as she took her head out of the water and collapsed on her butt, before she puffed her cheeks up at the fact that she had missed everyone.\n\n\"Magical Girl Satan-chan, they said something about going shopping nya.\" The black cat pointed out with one open eye, and by the sound of the voice that the cat was giving off one could only assume that this was Kuroka. Not to mention that only those close to her, or the stupid, would dare call a Satan like her such a disrespectful nickname. Kuroka had power equal to that of a Ultimate-Class devil, so she was able to get away with a lot when she wanted to. Kuroka even had a smirk on her cat face as she spoke her words, but Serafall cheered up and jumped back to her feet as her large breasts bounced with barely a restraint to them as she pumped both of her fists in the air with a toothy smile on her face.\n\n\"Thanks Nyan-chan, Magical Girl Sera-tan is off to the mall!\" Serafall shouted as she ran out of the pool area and started to go quickly in the direction of where she thought the mall was, while Kuroka closed her eyes and enjoyed the sun some more.\n\n'Idiot, couldn't even tell I was lying... after the Phenex girl was turned into Chicken Soup they all went back to the clubroom. Oh well, she will learn that they aren't at the mall soon enough.' Kuroka thought as she remembered the event of everyone taking Ravel towards the clubroom. She was surprised that Naruto had already managed to turn a Grim Reaper into a loyal member of his peerage, and not only that, but a Grim Reaper that was giving off power almost equal to that of a High-Class Devil. Then there was the blue haired girl that Kuroka had seen Naruto turn into a devil not very long ago, and she was the possessor of one of the four most powerful Holy swords to ever be forged by the God himself. Naruto was already building up an amazingly powerful peerage, and even more so when one considered the untold amount of untapped potential that they all had. That huge girl had amazing levels of strength that were normally beyond that of a Rook anyway, but add the Rook piece to that... not even Kuroka wanted to get hit by one of those punches. SS-Level Threat she may be, but even she couldn't simply brush off getting hit by the strength of a Cyclops/Giant that was being powered up by the Rook. That was like the same thing as being sucker punched by the infamous son of Zeus of Greek legend.\n\nYou didn't just walk off that kind of punching power easily.\n\nThen there was the already amazingly fast Grim Reaper girl being given the boosts of the Knight, making her so fast that Kuroka was sure that the girl would be able to leave behind afterimages when she burst at her full speed. Combine that with her lifeforce stealing cursed scythe and you have a deadly combination that could kill many with ease. Not to mention, that Grim Reapers were already pretty durable on their own, being from a species that were labled as Half-Gods came with a few perks. Not to mention that Kuroka did a little research on the girl in the time that she had learned her name when she attacked Naruto and Kyokan at her house, the girl was related to one of the most power Grim Reapers to ever exist. An Ultimate-Class Grim Reaper, with was equal to a Satan-Class Devil in pure raw power alone. That spoke volumes of her potential.\n\nNaruto himself owned the Excalibur, another of the Four most powerful Holy swords. That meant that in his group there were two of the most powerful Holy swords to ever be forged. That was some good fire power right there, and she was sure that Naruto fully understood this.\n\n'I wonder though... who will you be using those Mutation Pieces on Otouto?' Kuroka thought with a small grin on her face, knowing that Naruto had two Mutation Pieces in his set. She knew for a fact that he hadn't used either of them yet on anyone that he had brought under his service. The Queen that had been used on Serafall had been a normal Queen, but because Naruto himself was pretty strong he had the power to use it on Serafall without it being a Mutation Piece. His current pieces remaining were his Mutation Rook and a Mutation Pawn, both of his Bishops, and seven normal Pawns. She had to admit that she knew for a fact that Naruto was going to ask her to become a member of his peerage, most likely as his Bishop... of course she had little doubt he wanted her to have the reserves boost that came with eing a Bishop.\n\nOf course, after a decade of training Kuroka had increased her own reserves to amazing levels, so she didn't even need to boost of the Bishop to get stronger. If anything, she was sure that a different piece would be more suited for her. Even with the Bishop, that left her body exposed, and ulike a Bishop she was a close-mid range fighter. She needed to get in close for her fighting style to be more effective, her Senjutsu skills and Touki abilities were best made for very close combat. With the body enhancing and predicting abilities of Senjutsu, and the explosive power boost of using Touki her strongest range was close range. Most assumed that just because she used illusions and range techniques that the Bishop was best for her, but with her reflexes and other close range related abilities taken into consideration... she was more of a Knight or Rook in all truth. So what if she liked to use magical poison to slowly kill and torture her enemies so that they had slow an agonizing deaths, she could throw a punch or claw very easily.\n\nShe was getting ahead of herself though, because Naruto had yet to ask her to actually join as of yet... but she knew him well enough to know that he was going to ask her soon.\n\n\"Nyahahaha! Things are starting to get fun, aren't they Ophis nya?\" Kuroka asked as she opened her eye and saw Ophis standing on top of the diving board behind her, looking down at her with almost emotionless eyes that screamed ice cold death to those that were against her. Kuroka had known the second that Ophis had shown up, and Ophis wasn't shocked at this fact.\n\n\"I, have set forth my plans.\" Ophis stated in her strange way of talking, while Kuroka narrowed her eyes and looked towards Ophis with suspicion clear in those golden pearls. It was obvious to Kuroka that Ophis was making some sort of plan involving Naruto... it was always Naruto. Ophis had found her ace when she found him, but then that damn Great Red had made the Uchiha boy his ace as well so that he would have a defence against the ace that Ophis had picked. Both boys had been amazing in their lives as humans. Ophis smirked very, very, lightly and looked up at the sky with her steel grey eyes.\n\n\"Otouto, you have something planned around him nya.\" Kuroka plain stated, and she wasn't making this a question. She knew that Ophis was going to interfere with Naruto's life again... she had been doing that a lot lately. Kuroka had recently learned that the reason they had ended up with the Gremory family instead of another devil family was because Ophis had been behind the devil's that had been chasing them vanishing. She wanted Naruto to become close to the Four Satans, and there was no better way than to have him become a member of the Gremory girl's future peerage... Naruto was the kind of person in both lives that grew stronger when he got friends and positive attention. The Gremory would give him that attention, and Naruto was the kind of guy that made friends with almost everyone quickly. The more powerful his friends, the more powerful Naruto himself could become.\n\nPlacing him near a Super Devil like Sirzechs would onlyu benefit Naruto in the long run, as well as grant him a body that was even more suited for attaining the power he had before his death... and even surpassing it.\n\nOphis had placed the idea in Ravel's mind years ago through the use of the girl's dreams that she wanted to use the contract to force the boy to marry her. The girl's feelings were real, but what better way to help Naruto regain his old guts and unbreakable resolve than to force him to chose between himself and others. Naruto had passed Ophis' test with flying colors, so she helped him out of the marraige by getting Asia and forcing the girl to devour one of her snakes so that the Boosted Gear would become powerful enough for even a girl like Asia to defeat a devil like Ravel. Ophis had given Asia the needed power boost to win without telling the girl, and then she informed the girl just how to negate the marraige. Not only had she promised Naruto another strong ally, but Naruto had grown closer to somebody... he was now in a position where he would do anything and gain any amount of power if Asia' life was on the line.\n\nThat would suit Ophis' needs just fine.\n\n\"Yes, Naruto must undergo challenges... I simply gave Katerea the needed information to insure that she would target the boy for what was inside him.\" Ophis told Kuroka, while the black cat frowned deeply at the information.\n\nKaterea Leviathan, a true descendant of the original Leviathan that Serafall had replaced when the original had been killed. She was an Ultimate-Class Devil that Ophis had recruited into the Khaos Brigade, and Kuroka knew for a fact that this woman's only goal in life was to case chaos and destruction for Earth, the Underworld, and Heaven. She wanted to destroy everything that existed... or rather, she wanted to destroy everything that stood in her way. She wanted to have the Four Satans killed and regain control of the Underworld.\n\n\"What... what information nya?\" Kuroka actually stuttered when she realized that something wasn't right about this, while Ophis smiled lightly and pulled up the sleeve on her right arm and showed Kuroka that Ophis had markings going up her forearm. These markings were in the same of strange runes, but inside of each rune were more smaller runes that seemed to link together to form a matrix of some sort that Kuroka knew she would never understand no matter how much she wanted to.\n\nThis was the Sealing Key that had been created by Naruto and Sasuke when the two of them sealed the Kaguya, and by extension the Shinju and Madara inside of her, inside of Naruto. She had of course stolen it and applied it to herself so that she could release Naruto's true power when she believed that he was ready for it, and she had modified it a small amount so that she would be able to lock away the other lesser Tailed Beasts inside of Naruto so that they couldn't ruin her plans. She didn't need them helping Naruto regain his power to quickly and end up destroying his body once more, meaning that she would have to recollect his soul before anyone else could take it and put it back together again so that she could start again.\n\nThe last time Naruto exploded, he had wiped the Elemental Nations off the map, and had caused the entire planet to undergo a massive and startling change. The landscapes all around the worlds shifted away from the explosion, and the water levels on the planet seemed to drop, meaning that that more land appeared on the planet even after the destruction of the Elemental Nations... of course, Ophis wouldn't let everything be destroyed. She had managed to regain and store some of Naruto's wordly possession with a priestess family that had been reborn thanks to the Biblical God bringing the soul of the Shion girl back to life and allowing her to restart and guard the possessions of Naruto in wait for him to be reborn.\n\n\"I, gave her a lesser key... a key to Shinju.\" Ophis answered Kuroka after a few moments, and the cat looked confused at how Ophis worded that. Ophis had given Katerea a lesser key to the seal on Naruto, one that would let her rip out the Shinju from Naruto so that Naruto would come face to face with one of his greatest foes. One that could destroy entire countries in minutes, a being that could spell the end of the world... of course, she wouldn't allow her ace to be placed in danger just like that. If she felt that he was dying or losing, then she would very quickly return the Shinju back to the seal inside of Naruto. She had the original sealing key after all, and she had learned how to use it.\n\nThe Shinju, the Primordial God that was created by Kaguya, somebody that even Ophis wouldn't dare take on in a one on one fight with the hopes of winning. That woman... her abilities with space and time, and her abilities over creation and destruction... even Ophis would admit to being lacking if she had to fight that monster in human form. The woman could use the moon to place and illusion over and entire planet, a nearly unbreakable illusion that would allow her to reform those caught in it into those monsters known as the Zetsu. The Great Red himself was a bi-product of Kaguya' power over creation, and even he paled in comparison to the one that created him.\n\nThe only reason that nobody but herself had ever seen Kaguya' full power, was because she refused to harm the planet that she had refered to her as precious nursery. In the Dimensional Rift though, Ophis had witnessed the full depths of that monster's full power. That was why she had an infinite amount of respect for Naruto, because he had surpassed and defeated the Primordial Goddess, and her Primordial Tree, and even the imitation God Madara. Ophis might have been able to defeat Madara with relative ease, with him being able to injure her a good amount, but the other two were truly scary. The Shinju at it's fullest power had about half of Ophis' full power, while Kaguya... there were no words to truly descrive the depth of her power.\n\nIf she could create Primordial-God level beings from nothing, and those beings only be a small portion of her own power... then it was safe to say that she was not somebody you wanted to get on the bad side of.\n\nKuroka shivered when she noticed the aura around Ophis change from neutral, to an aura so cold that even she wasn't going to question Ophis any further than this. She knew that she shouldn't push her luck anymore, but that didn't mean that she wouldn't be ready to help Naruto out of any trouble that he was going to be getting into. She knew that Naruto was going to be in danger, and that Ophis was going to continue to place challenges in Naruto's path to make him stronger, but as his older sister she had to do her best to try and help him wherever she could.\n\n'I can't help it if Ophis wants to involve herself in his life... but I can at leats help him when he needs it.' Kuroka thought with a small frown, knowing for a fact that nothing she said would change Ophis' mind about this.\n\nThings were going to take a turn for the worst soon if Katerea actually managed to get her hands on Naruto... she just knew it.\n\nCall it an older sister's intuition.\n\n_**Chapter End!**_  \n_**Next To Be Updated: Naruto the Strange Mage**_  \n_**Please Leave Me Lots Of Nice Long Reviews, But No Flames Please!**_\n\n\nEnd file.\n",

    "TEXT": "D.Gray-Man, Harry Potter 1. Chapter 1\n\nThe rain drummed down from the grey sky onto the grey cobble stones (apathetically?) soaking both the young white haired boy clutching an infant swaddled in blankets to protect it from the cold and the semi-circle of thugs surrounding them. The most heavily tattooed of the gang stepped forward and pointed at the crouched boy- his gesture made more menacing by the bicycle chain wrapped around his knuckles\n\n\"Pay up!\" He snarled silently congratulating himself at the impressive figure he struck- those weeks at the gym had been worth it. He clenched his fist tighter to flex his biceps slightly more 'this freak must be terrified of me' he thought, quietly proud of his ability to deal with the kid. The others had been frightened. Something about the kid being devil's spawns. Hah! As if that would scare him! The kid didn't look like anything special. Sure his hair was freaky but anyone with a little bleach could do that.\n\nAllen cursed his foolishness for the thousandth time, you would have thought that after all he had gone through he would know better than to trust people. Keeping his head bowed to prevent them from seeing his scar and to sate their ego he said\n\n\"I fully paid both our passages in Japan. I owe you nothing\"\n\nNormally he would have taken his chances. With his arm and his agility, there was a fair chance that he could have defeated them but he had Mai with him and he couldn't risk her being hurt.\n\n\"Sure ya paid for the passage but what about protection, freak? Two kids alone on the streets- who knows what could happen. Pay us and you've nothing to fear. Don't pay... you get my meaning yes?\"\n\nAllen tightened his grip on Mai, furiously calculating his escape route. Mai stirred and Allen's heart skipped a beat as she woke from her sleep to find she was cold, wet and surrounded by the very embodiments of every child's worst nightmare. Fear filled her eyes and she started to cry.\n\n\"Shut that thing up!\" the leader roared kicking out at the boy.\n\nAllen leapt backwards, his head snapping up\n\n\"Don't you touch her\" her snarled.\n\nThe thug let out a yell as he caught a glimpse of the blood red scar that ran the length of the boys face and he instinctively flicked his wrist out, sending the rusted chain flying towards the boy and infant\n\nTime seemed to slow down as the chain curved its way towards the boy. He immediately twisted his body around shielding the wailing infant with his back, clutching her close to him, wrapping his arms around her small body\n\nHe let out a yell of pain as the chain laid open his back and sent him flying to the ground. Gritting his teeth, he opened his eyes and forced himself to his knees. He thrust the child- now frightened to silence- into a gap between the rubbish bags piled up in the alleyway. He rolled himself back to his feet and staggered away from the hiding place, trying to put as much distance as possible between it and him. He reached out with his mind to his innocence.\n\n\"Innocence!\" He yelled but before he could complete the connection, one of the thugs punched him hard in the gut and the sudden lack of oxygen drove every coherent thought out of his head. Before he could gather up his scattered wits, the rest of the gang plucked up the courage to join in their favourite game of 'beat up the helpless innocent'. The initial wave of overwhelming pain faded off as they continued the beating and Allen's mind re-booted, just as he was about to connect to his innocence again, he saw something which once again drove all coherent thoughts from his head. Mai had picked herself up from her hiding place and was toddling towards the monstrous trolls that were making her adopted papa cry with pain. Her eyes were alights with steely determination as she launched herself at the leader\n\n\"LEAVE MY PAPA ALONE!\" she yelled, grabbing a handful of the man's trousers and tugging as hard as she could. Now here is a little side-note to all those who wear hipster jeans to look cool- combine low slung jeans with the weight of a three year old child and, well, let's just say any coolness factor given to you by the jeans is very suddenly revoked. Mai fell to the ground, confused, her hand still clutching a handful of the monsters jeans. Bicycle chain man all of a sudden found himself standing comically with his trousers around his ankles and the centre of amusement for the rest of the gang. His eyes narrowed in fury as he looked down at the cause of his humiliation and he raised his hand then snapped it down, sending the bicycle chain flying towards the little girl at an astonishing speed\n\nAllen saw what happened from his vantage point on the ground. As soon as the thug raised his hand, he knew what was about to happen. Despair and fear filled every essence of his being. He couldn't make it in time. He reached out his arm in a useless attempt to reach her\n\n\"NO! MAAAII!\"\n\n\n\t2. Chapter 2\n\nDumbledore leaned back in his chair frowning slightly at the readings on the screen in front of him, tuning in and out of the ramblings of the ministry goon who hadn't stopped for a breath from the second he had entered the room\n\n\"...and then it spikes again here, here... makes no sense... wavelength varies from the usual. See here is the usual magic wave and this is the new one... tried triangulating... possibly here or there...\"\n\nDumbledore sighed slightly. This was so tiresome. He needed to be at the school, Harry was bound to do something stupid anytime soon and he had to make sure that Snape was handling Quirrell. This was no time to be stuck in an office because of a machine malfunction which was the only logical explanation for these readings. A magic wavelength that wasn't a magic wavelength? That only appeared at odd times? That was coupled with a new presence of magic? Impossible. The machine he was watching was the ministry's means of tracking all wizards beneath the age of the Trace. It sensed the presence of known Magic, showing it as a red dot on the screen. When Magic was activated, a green dot appeared. This was how muggle born wizards were found and was how underage magicians were watched to ensure they didn't use magic out of school. Each magic wavelength was slightly different which meant that the machine could only track a magician after said magician has performed magic in some way allowing the machine a sufficient reading to store and remember that particular wavelength.\n\nThe machine however was now very confused. It had been sending out nonsensical readings for three days now, leaving the ministry goons completely bamboozled forcing them to send for Dumbledore. The man in question was leaning forward in his chair, hooked nose almost touching the screen. He muttered a few spells under his breath which ran through the system checking it for errors, but each spell returned with nothing to report. Dumbledore frowned slightly, his brain immediately calculating out new theories. He muttered a few more spells to follow the wavelength and figure out the location of this new anomaly but as the ministry man had said, the wavelength was too weak. All of a sudden however, alarms went off. The dot which they had coloured- after some deliberation- amber, pulsed green. The machines went wild, rattling out wavelengths at an astonishing rate on knots. The ministry goon looked about ready to take a heart attack\n\n\"This is impossible! He spluttered the readings are through the roof; this magic is way too powerful to be from a child. We must have an illegal wizard presence on British soil! This could mean war! Dumble...\" He looked up but the chair was empty\n\n**A/N- this chapter probably requires and explanation right? OK, so for those who are interested, here goes**\n\n**Innocence is a form of magic in a way- it is a magical substance, a bit like the philosophers stone (no, Ed, not THAT philosophers stone...) hence the wonky wavelength. More will be revealed later on! I do have it mostly sorted out in my head, but it needs a little fine-tuning and I like to keep you all in suspense!**\n\n**OK, more complex description of the machine, What it does-in more depth- is track the presence of magic. This is how wizards are tracked. When a new young wizard uses magic for something, the machine picks up the magic wavelength and triangulates it. The goons then get details to figure out if the person is muggle born or whatever, their age, address etc. This ps is the way the letters are always so accurately addressed. Once the witch/wizard has been picked up by the machine, their wavelength is better recognised and the machine can then track and subsequent use of magic can be traced. **\n\n**As Allens Innocence is a magic substance but not magic itself, the machine got confuddled. Poor thing.**\n\n**Anywaaaaaays, hope you enjoyed, sorry bout the shpeel. Any (nice) reviews are more than welcome- this is my first ever fanfic- so... HELP!**\n\n\n\t3. Chapter 3\n\n**:O I cannot _believe_ that people have started to like this already! I 3 you guys ^^**\n\n**BlizzardNight- I will do my utmost to keep this up- I have a fairly bad track record for leaving things half done, but I don't think I could do that with this even if I wanted too- It keeps writing itself in my head :P bloody annoying! (thx so much for the encouragement)**\n\n**Griffencub- ta muchly! hope you enjoy...**\n\n**NecronWarrior- I know *ashamed face* but clichés are sooo fuuuun :( **\n\n**Claudia Dionzeros- TADA! Just for you!**\n\nDumbledore's mind was calculating furiously even as he disapparated to follow the sudden lock he had got on the position of the magic. There was a possibility, he supposed that this was a wizard who had illegally arrived in Britain but that explanation seemed unlikely. He arrived in a filthy street, rain drummed down making the place, if possible more sinister. He was about to send out a locating spell to pinpoint the exact position of the wavelength when a child's sobbing reached his ears. He immediately ran after the noise. Nothing could have prepared him for what he saw as he rounded the corner of one of the alleyways. A young boy with white hair lay unconscious in a pool of blood, A Japanese infant kneeling next to him crying inconsolably\n\n\"Wake up Papa! I'm scared. Wake up!\"\n\nThe most shocking thing however was the alley way. It looked like an explosion had taken place. The paving stones were bone dry in a huge radius around the boy. Scorch marks patterned the walls and most surprising of all, slumped around the boy at the edges of the blast marks were seven huge, muscled and unconscious thugs\n\nDumbledore smirked slightly as he made his way towards the strange scene. That's the thing about this bizarre world, he thought to himself. Just when you think you have seen all there is to see, it proves you wrong in the most spectacular way possible.\n\n**A/N I know! Sorry it's so tiny... just wait a sec, the next one is flipping HUGE :p hope you liked... review... sorry bout any clichéd expressions necron :P**\n\n**P.S, I hope I spelt disapparated properly**\n\n**Oh, I should probably add here as a little extra info to those who care, The worldwide wizarding society is very private and secret (as is said in the 4th book) So if a wizard was to appear from another country and perform powerful magic on Brittish soil... well it wouldn't be good**\n\n\n\t4. Chapter 4\n\nHarry watched as Dumbledore walked away, still unsatisfied with the explanation he had been given by the man. He sighed in frustration and glanced around the ward- he hated hospitals, sitting still for long periods of time were just _not_ his idea of fun. His eyes passed over the bed opposite him and he was slightly surprised to see the curtains drawn around it. Curiosity peaked he sat up, wincing as he did so. Who else would be in the hospital wing at such a late stage of the year? He tried in vain to peer through the crack where the curtains met. He gave up after almost falling out of his bed in an attempt to get at an angle where he could see through the crack and resigned himself to waiting till the nurse came to treat the patient. Whoever it was. He slumped back on his pillows with a sigh of irritation. He HATED hospitals. Suddenly, there was a noise that made him bolt upright in shock, and then grit his teeth and double over as his body protested- loudly- to the sudden movement.\n\nA child was crying from behind the curtains. There was no mistaking that noise- it was definitely a young child. Harry's eyes widened further as her heard another voice. A shadow raised itself on the curtain as the bed's occupant sat up. He heard the sleepy voice of a young boy comfort the child\n\n\"Hush, Mai, you're OK, you're safe here\"\n\nHe heard a rustle of blankets as the child was lifted up out of its cot and he continued to listen in utter shock as the boy behind the curtain comforted the young child. What on earth was a child doing here? In Hogwarts? And who on earth was this boy? Curiosity overflowing, Harry strained once again to try and get a glimpse of the beds occupants through the curtains. He suddenly righted himself as the gap of the curtains that he had been watching suddenly opened. Harry could barely believe what he saw. A young boy stood at the edge of the bed, his entire upper body swaddled in bandages. He cradled a sobbing toddler to his chest singing a foreign lullaby gently to her\n\n\"_soshite bouya_ wa _nemuri ni tsuita_\"\n\nThe most shocking thing about the boy however was his pure white hair and the giant scar that rand the length of his face, ending at his chin and disappearing up through his messy hair. The boy looked up and seemed surprised to have an audience. He smiled gentle\n\n\"Sorry if we disturbed you\" he said sheepishly, bowing slightly\n\nHarry shook his head\n\n\"Don't worry about it\" He said easily \"I was bored out of my skull anyways, needed a good distraction. I hate hospitals\" He smiled up at the strange boy. Any time a year ago and perhaps this would have thrown him but recent events in his life had more or less taken away his ability to be shocked into silence.\n\nThe white haired boy chuckled quietly\n\n\"Yea, I hate them too. I don't like sitting still for so long doing nothing. Seems like a colossal waste of time if you ask me\" he made his way over to the bed and sat down at the foot of it, still gently rocking the young girl who's wails had quietened though she still snuffled every now and again\n\n\"Sing, Papa\" she commanded sleepily. The boy looked down at her lovingly and began to softly sing again. He glanced up at me, his grey eyes smiling, and he paused in his singing\n\n\"Sorry about this, she had a nightmare\" He immediately picked up the song again, rocking the young girl in his arms\n\n\"Don't worry about it\" Harry replied. Then unable to contain his curiosity- \"Papa?\" He asked. The boy smiled at him again and stroked the little girls head.\n\n\"Yea\" he said pausing in his singing again, keeping his voice quiet and soft so you could barely tell the difference between him singing and speaking \"I have been caring for Mai practically from the day she was born, I am the closest thing to a dad that she has. She began to call me it as soon as she could talk. I never stopped her\" he picked up the song again, not missing a beat\n\nHarry looked over at him, shocked at how easily he had handed over this piece of personal information\n\n\"What happened to her real parents?\" he asked. Then added quickly \"It's OK if you don't want to say you know\"\n\nThe boy looked up from the now slumbering child.\n\n\"It's OK\" he said. He stroked her check with his little finger, a look of tenderness on his face. He seemed to consider his words carefully before he looked up at Harry, measuring his reaction to what he said \"There was an earthquake at her home town. She was just newly born at that time. Her parents- for whatever reason- hadn't gotten her out of the house in time. It collapsed. Later, when going through the rubble, they found her, sleeping peacefully with a lump of concrete suspended impossibly above her. They threw her out onto the street, said she was possessed by a demon and left her there\"\n\nThe boys face became shadowed and melancholy \"When I found her, she was only just clinging onto life. I took her away from that place and never looked back\" He gave me a rather calculating look \"You don't seem bothered by the idea that she used magic\"\n\nHarry gave a wry chuckle \"well you see...\"\n\n**A/N OK little bit of an explanation needed here I guess. I know everyone hates OC's but I never meant to write this down properly and she just seemed to fit into this story. I DO HAVE REASONS! I removed Cross Marion from this story, and I felt like Allen needed someone to keep his sanity after Mana's death- Mai was his reason to keep walking (sorryforbeingsochilchednecron!). She isn't really a key character though. At least, not yet **\n\n**Oh and btw, I am a lazy bum, see that ellipsis at the end... yea, that's Harry explaining the wonders of magic and hogwarts to Allen. I. Am. NOT. Writing all that in. Use your imagination :P**\n\n\n\t5. Chapter 5\n\n**NecronWarrier- I promise on chocolate truffles that I will not make Mai a Mary Sue... and yeah I won't deny I am considering it *ashamedface* though I must say I also like AllenxLuna But NO! Not getting into that yet, they are too young!**\n\n**Claudia Dionzeros- Well, I hadn't planned on introducing them till maybe forth year, because Allen didn't meet them till he was 15 after all, but tell me what you think ^^ I am not adverse to changes :)**\n\n**Kureru- TADA! Especially for you :P And I know right! Allen is a great papa... Promise to keep Mai a minor character though, I too share a hate for OC's, but you will see her importance soon- ooh look at me being all mysterious! :P**\n\nDumbledore marched purposely towards the Hospital Wing. Madame Pomfrey had informed him a few hours ago that the boy had woken. He would have got down strait away if it hadn't been for the bumbling buffoons that called themselves 'Ministry Officials' Dumbledore developed an eye twitch just thinking about the mountains of paper work he had been forced to fill in about the incident and that was before they had even interviewed the boy to figure out who he was and why he was here!. Dumbledore gave an irritated sigh as he made his way up the corridor. The poor boy would probably be in a right state, having woken up in a strange place with no idea of how he got there or who had taken him there. He pushed open the ward doors and froze in the doorway, his mouth comically ajar.\n\nThe young boy in question was sitting cross legged at the bottom of _Harry Potter's_ _bed_ surrounded by a sea of brightly coloured wrapping papers both Harry and the boy were hysterically laughing as they took turns at throwing Bertie Bott's Every Flavoured Beans into each other's mouths. In the middle of the bed, the little Japanese girl slumbered soundly, oblivious to the noise around her. Both boys were completely unaware of the elderly man's presence as Allen practically threw up the sweet Harry had managed to- eventually- throw into his mouth. He turned bright red and grabbed his throat dramatically with both hands, steam practically billowing out of his ears 'chilli!' he gasped as tears streamed down his bright red face. Harry bent over double at the waist laughing so hard tears began to stream down his face too- \"you know the rules Allen!\" he chocked out between his out-of-control laughter \"you've got to swallow it!\" Allen let out a moan of pain and clamped both his hands over his mouth, gulping the sweet down. He let out a victory cry, punching the air with joy \"YATA!\"(1) he cried. He glanced over to the door and immediately dropped his arms to his sides again and looking slightly sheepish he jumped up from the bed, bowing slightly at the waist \"I am so sorry sir!\" he said with an apologetic look \"I didn't see you there... correct me if I am wrong, but are you by any chance Professor Dumbledore?\"\n\n**Erm, roughly translates to YAY! I DID IT! :P**\n\n**ps, he knew Dumbledore's name coz Harry told him, He was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital...**\n\n**pps soz for any errors- I have already found one in one of the previous chapters- off to fix that now. Feel free to yell at me if you see any :)**\n\n**ppps Allen and Mai speak English and Japanese. They will mostly stick to English however I will chuck in a few Japanese words every now again, purely because I am so proud of myself for knowing some**\n\n\n\t6. Chapter 6\n\n**Claudia Dionzers- I think I'll stick with him **_**meeting **_**them in the fourth book- I may need to do some stuff from the orders POV to explain stuff- We shall see :P P.S, your opinion means a lot to me... after all, you lot are my readers- there'd be little point in me publishing my work on here if I wasn't going to listen to what you guys wanted!**\n\n**BlizzardNight- 3 3 glad you liked it ^^**\n\n**Kureru- Yea, that was really fun to write :D unfortunately I wont be able to have them together again till after the 'summer holidays' (In the story- not real life) but I promise! As soon as I get all my silly plot-line explanation out of the way, I will publish at least one chapter purely dedicated to Harry and Allen foolishness :D **\n\n**P.S, apologies to all for the teenyness of my chapters so far- I have for some bizarre and unknown reason been updating a paragraph at a time so here is a proper chapter. Enjoy!**\n\nThere had been very few moments in Professor Dumbledore's long life in which he had been speechless and yet for the second time in 24 hours, he found himself at a loss for words. Here in front of him were two boys who had just gone through more pain and sorrow in the past day than most adults had ever gone through in a lifetime and yet, here they were laughing and playing as if all the horrors they had seen had been nothing more than bad dreams that soon dissolved into nothingness once woken from. Children's ability of recovery never ceased to amaze him- somehow even in the most dire of situations, that childishness, that innocence remained- untainted by the cynicism that the old so often suffer from. He realised then that he had not answered the boy yet and both he and Harry were giving the old man strange looks, Dumbledore chuckled lightly again, allowing the sparkle to return to his eyes.\n\n\"I am indeed him, young child, though it seems as if I am at a disadvantage here for you know my name but I do not know yours\" He raised an eyebrow slightly at the boy who was still bent at the waist \"oh and there is no need to bow to me, young child. I am nobody special\" his eyes shone with silent mirth as the boy straitened up. \"aha, sorry about that sir!\" he said sheepishly rubbing the back of his head \"My name is Allen Walker, and this here is Mai.\" the boy's grey eyes met the headmasters bright blue ones and the headmaster could see the intelligence behind them , along with the guarded calculating look that came from those who had been hurt once too often. \"It's nice to meet you Allen. I need you to come with me now though- if you feel up to it- there are some questions we need answered\" the boy's eyes narrowed slightly and became significantly more guarded \"and by 'we' you mean...who exactly?\" Dumbledore sighed slightly. This was going to be problematic.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Dumbledore looked sideways at the young boy as he walked beside him, the young child- Mai- cradled in his arms. He had adamantly refused to leave her behind in the hospital wing and after debating it out, Dumbledore had caved- being unable to come up with any soundly logical reason for leaving the child behind<p>\n\n'_The questioning will take a long time Allen, what if she wakes up because of the noise?\"_\n\n\"_Harry and I have been making enough noise to wake a statue and she is still asleep\"_\n\n\"_What if she becomes hungry then?\"_\n\n\"_Then I will remove myself from the room and feed her of course- If I left her here and she woke up hungry, she wouldn't stop screaming till I came anyway. She doesn't take kindly to strangers\"_\n\n\"_Questioning rooms are no place for a child\"_\n\n\"_**I**__ am a child, professor Dumbledore\"_\n\nThis final remark had effectively shut the professor up. To be honest, he was glad he had been able to convince the boy to come along at all; he had not seemed too keen on the idea. He watched curiously as the young boy gazed around the huge and almost rudely magic school, his face remained expressionless but Dumbledore could tell from his wide eyes that he was affected more than he let on\n\n\"You seem very comfortable with all this magic stuff\" Dumbledore said casually as they headed up another set of moving stairs \"I take it you were raised around magic then?\"\n\nAllen didn't look over at the headmaster, too preoccupied by the painting of goblins gambling around a table, all arguing loudly. He leaned close to the picture as the grey goblin in the corner won again \"Do you guys know he has a set of cards hidden up his sleeve, right?\"(**1)** He said innocently, smirking slightly as the goblin disappeared beneath his rather disgruntled fellow gamblers. He raised his eyes to meet Dumbledore's, his face slightly wary but he seemed to decide that there was no hidden agenda behind the question \"No, I didn't grow up around magic, I have however come across many inexplicable things in my life so the existence of magic wasn't a complete shock for me. Plus I have been cross examining Harry and he explained everything\" He said simply. Dumbledore smiled slightly again, that childish acceptance again with the odd mixture of adult logic and intelligence. This boy was going to be most interesting.\n\nThe room that the ministry had commandeered from the school had been stripped of all furniture except a single wooden chair. All around the room, machines had been set up, screens blank and menacing. The main ministry official stepped forward- frowning as he noticed the child in the boys arm.\"She isn't allowed in here\" He said firmly\n\nAllen raised one eyebrow \"I won't say anything unless she is allowed to stay\" he said coolly, all traced of the childish, carefree boy now gone to be replaced by a poker-face that any professional gambler would be proud of.**(1)**\n\nThe ministry official seemed at a loss for what to say and began to splutter quite eloquently in indignation \"The Foreign Wizard Policy of 1987 states quite clearly in article 6, heading 23, subsection 43 that in the case of...\" Dumbledore smoothly interrupted the man \"Why what an excellent idea\" _ahh... what on earth was this one's name again? They all looked the sam_e... \"er, Fredrick! Er, Allen, as Fredrick was about to say, the Foreign Wizard Policy gives ministry officials the right to question a highly suspicious person alone, but as he was about to say, you are not highly suspicious, so we will allow this to pass. In return however, we will require you to answer all the questions as fully and clearly as you can\"\n\n'Fredrick' gaped rather vacantly for a few minutes as he tried to process what had just happened. Once his brain had caught up, he cleared his throat impressively and nodded in conformation\n\n\"Indeed, ah, precisely what I was about to say... young man, these machines here are to record heart rate etcetera. We will know therefore if you lie at all in your statement. If you do so, we will be forced to submit you to questioning under Veritaserum. Now, I am sure that you will give us no reason to do so. We proceed in good faith therefore that you will answer all our queries clearly and fully and... erm... yes. Indeed\" he coughed again and marched over to the screens, tapping them with his wand. The screens all at once burst into life and lines danced up and down along with the rhythm of Allen's heart. \"Now boy, explain to us how exactly you received that curse mark, what happened to your arm and what brought you here to England?\"\n\nAllen gulped slightly. He glanced up at Dumbledore '_I dearly hope I am not making a mistake again, trusting someone. He saved my life... and Harry trusts him completely. Plus there is something about him. All my instincts are telling me that he is dependable.' _ He turned to face the interrogator and tried not to look at the machine behind him that had started to dance more violently as the boy's heart cried out for him to turn around and not stop running till this castle was a mere speck in the horizon '_here goes nothing'_\n\n**There! That was better right! I know I said I was going to try to pace myself in chapter uploading... but... well, the last chapter didn't really count it was that small and I felt guilty and the next chapter will probably take me longer to do coz it is plot-line necessary... so yea :D**\n\n**(1)- Yes, Allen is a professional gambler in this too- that was how he managed to feed his own... interesting? appetite and keep Mai happy and healthy without resorting to full blown thievery**\n\n**reviewreviewreview!**\n\n\n\t7. Chapter 7\n\n**Hope your all prepared for a little plot development! Here is where you see why I needed Mai in the story. I guess her character is similar to Komui's in Man- she is critical to the character but not a critical character in herself (Sorry Necronwarrior- Unless I can find a way to somehow tie her in. I have no ideas yet but we shall see- she may indeed become useful again at some point in the future, in which case, yes, you totally called it :P)**\n\n**Kureru- Thank you!I am quite fond of my brain myself. Don't know were I'd be without it ^^**\n\n**Claudia Dionzeros- They will do as any good government does when presented with information critical to their countries well-being and safety. They will stick their fingers in their ears, screw up their eyes and pretend it's not there.**\n\nAllen took a deep breath\n\n\"I am afraid there is very little I can tell you about how my arm came to be the way it is. It had been like this as long as I can remember and unfortunately I never knew my parents so I can't tell you if I was born like this or not. In fact, I don't really know much at all about my childhood, my earliest memories are of living on the streets, alone\" He shifted slightly in his seat and licked his lips glancing nervously up at Dumbledore again before continuing \"Then I met Mana. He was a clown at a travelling circus and he took me in. Taught me... how to deal with life, with people. I was a bit of a wreck to be honest when he found me\" A small smile graced the boys face as he reminisced \"I was angry at the world, full of bitterness and resentment for the lot life had dealt me. Mana showed me happiness, security\" he gave a dry chuckle \"He even knocked some manners into me. We travelled together, going from circus to circus, country to country. We had no home, but we needed no home. We were... happy, content to be with each other, the surroundings seemed... immaterial somehow. Mana became my family, I took on his last name, viewed him as a father and I think... I hope he viewed me as a son too. We were together for a few marvellous years\"\n\nThe smile faded from the boys face and Dumbledore's heart sank, he knew that look- that expression- he didn't need the boy to continue the story to know what happened \"He died\" Allen said bluntly, with no preamble, no explanation. He bowed his head and continued his story; eyes shut tight \"I don't know how. Why. All I know is he left me. They buried him- the circus people- and left. I stayed. Stayed with him. Didn't know how to be without him\" Allen shook his head and let out a low, bitter laugh, tilting his head back, opening his eyes, staring up at the ceiling, in an attempt to ward of tears \"I should have kept walking\" he muttered, almost to himself \"If I had listened to him and kept walking...\" he trailed off and gave a small sigh. \"How long I sat there I don't know. A man appeared to me. At least I think it was a man. He told me... told me I could have Mana back. Could be reunited with my dad, could regain the life I had lost\" he snorted and shook his head \"I believed him- stupid naive child that I was. He brought out this metal skeleton, sat it in front of me, told me all I needed to do was to call out for my Mana with my heart and soul and we would be reunited\"\n\nThere was a pause and Dumbledore glanced over at the boy, almost fearful for what would come next \"I called him\" came the strained whisper- barely audible and Dumbledore sighed tucking his chin into his chest. Of course he had. Who wouldn't? The boy continued his story, his voice becoming stronger and faster, as if he was frightened to slow down unless he stopped altogether \"There was a flash, the statue came to life, Mana's name inscribed on its forehead. It woke, moved, I thought, thought he had returned to me, that we would be together again. I didn't care that he was a metal skeleton; we would deal with that somehow all that mattered to me was that he was there to tell me what to do again, to tell me to sit up straight at the table, that children should be seen and not heard. To wrap me up against the cold and give me that sense of security again, to sing to me just one last time\" an almost ecstatic look had come over the boys face as he remembered the hope he had felt- Dumbledore had a sudden urge to cry out. To stop the inevitable 'but' that was about to come. To leave the story unfinished, with the hope and joy rather than carry on to the inescapable crash, the unavoidable disappointment and terribly painful truth. The dead didn't come back. Never. Not even ghosts were a true return to earth and loved ones were always to be disappointed.\n\n\"He cried out in pain.\" his voice faltered slightly here \"it was wrong. All wrong. He cried out to me, furious that I had brought him back, that I had so selfishly reclaimed him from God. He... He cursed me, slashed my face with his arm. And then\" He seemed to almost loose the will to go on here, tears spilled over and ran down his cheeks \"He was ordered to kill me, to wear my skin as his own, but before he could, my cursed arm... it... it changed. Became big, moved on its own and it... it killed him. I killed him. Killed the only man who...\" He broke himself off here and fell silent, struggling to regain his composition.\n\nDumbledore raised his head sharply- up until this point he had expected the boy to carry on and say that it had all been a trick, a farce, some cruel joke or twisted game played on an innocent child- but no- there was no mistaking it, _this man's soul had been returned to earth_. Impossible his mind immediately said but no- that was the only logical explanation, the fact that the return had been horrible, twisted and painful only served to confirm this theory. If the statue had seemed loving and free when it had awoken, he would have been suspicious but the pain it had felt, the anger and it's link to the one who had built it's body... it's need to kill...this could be the missing link, the answer to all his questions, he had never considered it up until now, but perhaps that long tabooed and feared branch of magic had returned. Dumbledore shivered, this was not good. Not good at all. But how had the boy destroyed it? What was the secret behind that arm?**(1)**\n\nHe glanced up at the interrogator. The man was white as a sheet, staring at the boy as if he had grown two heads and began spouting mermish. Behind him, his assistant ran check after check on the machine, unwilling to accept that the terrible tale we were hearing was true\n\n\"My hair turned white after that\" the boy's voice was low and flat again \"from that day on, I have born this scar as a punishment for my sin. As for what happened to me after that, I'm afraid I can tell you very little indeed. In fact I have no memories at all of what happened between that incident and when I found Mai here, alone and abandoned in a Japanese village. I had been walking on a sort of auto pilot till then I guess, body still functioning but my mind had shut down. She woke me again, somehow. Just holding her in my arms was enough to slowly banish the numbness that had engulfed me. Suddenly I had someone who needed me, I couldn't continue on the way I was going any more- uncaring as to whether I lived or not because although I had every right to be as careless as I wished with my life, I couldn't treat her in the same careless way. As soon as I lifted her up, I chose to be responsible for her. I suppose it was at that stage that I stopped walking for the dead and began walking for the living\" he said, once again seeming to be speaking to himself as much as us. He wiped the tears off his face and took a deep breath. \"After I regained some form of consciousness, I began to look for answers myself, and I believe I can explain a little of what happened to me\"\n\n**Hint hint hint hint :D**\n\n**More Explanation in the next chapter which I will aim to upload... say... Saturday?**\n\n**P.S, Kureru, I revoke what I previously said- there will be some more Harry and Allen hilarity before the fictional summer hollidays. I'm in the mood for a foolish chapter after so much seriousness. You're welcome!**\n\n\n\t8. Chapter 8\n\n**Necronwarrior- It'd be no fun if I told you would it? :D**\n\n**Kureru- Sorry 'bout that! I'm really glad you are enjoying this story- your comments always make me fell all warm and fuzzy inside ^^ Yea, by my reckoning, not the next chapter but the one after that will be packed with funnyness. I'm really looking forward to writing something a bit lighter- all this plot development is exhausting!**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Depends on how you define 'Exorcist Madness I guess...' We shall see :)**\n\nDumbledore peered at the young anomaly over the brim of his cup of tea, he had demanded- despite his overwhelming curiosity- to call for a much needed break before continuing with the questioning. He was concerned about the child, although magic had helped reconnect the severed muscle and skin, the body was still under a significant amount of stress as all the neurons and dendrites reconnected and healed. Plus the boy was so thin he looked like he hadn't had a good meal in ages- at least that was what Dumbledore had assumed- however as he watched the ungodly amount of food that the boy was consuming, he began to revise his theory (he was beginning to wonder if his mind wasn't beginning to go, the number of flawed conclusions he had been drawing up recently) He idly watched as delighted packs of house elves darted back and forward across the room bearing either plates towered high with a marvellous variety of foods or stacks of plates scraped clean by the young teen who was now sitting cross legged on his chair, all traces of previous distress gone as he quite cheerily gorged himself on the seemingly endless amounts of food being supplied to him. Mai, obviously quite used to such displays was happily playing with one of the discarded plates, tipping it up on its edge, then letting it wobble round faster and faster till it clattered to the ground, then repeating the action again and again gaining inexplicable joy from the sound it made as it ran round and round its rim. Dumbledore returned his attention back to the boy who was still steamrollering his way through the piles of food before him with no sign of slowing down. He silently pondered this new piece of information as he unwrapped a humbug and popped it into his mouth, delighting in its sweet mintyness. Perhaps this cursed scar or arm of his somehow affected his appetite, he wondered how, why- new ideas and theories and experiments flooding into his head uncontrollably before he very firmly squashed them.**(1)** No, he reminded himself firmly- he had learnt his lesson a long time ago; there were some times in life when you just had to wait it out. Running blind into something brandishing a scalpel rarely solved or helped anything and in fact, once everything was dismantled and torn apart you soon realised that the knowledge you gained was completely overshadowed by the destruction you had reaped and then you realised that had you just let things be, you would have not only learnt more but would also have allowed the thing you were observing to continue on and become more brilliant than it was when your observations first began. It was like finding a beautiful and unique flower, and dissecting it, finding out why it was, what it was, how it was only to then discover that not only was it only a seedling but it was also the last of its kind. He shook himself from his philosophising, Allen had finally finished eating- Dumbledore glanced fleetingly at his watch and then hurriedly checked it again- _2 hours!_ - He shook his head in disbelief; this boy's appetite was _amazing_\n\nAllen- completely unaware of the shock he had caused- pulled Mai onto his knee and began to feed her forkfuls of shepherd's pie, with small pieces of carrot cunningly concealed under the thick layer of potato, transforming the forkful of food into animals and methods of transport at Mai's whim. Unfortunately, about two thirds of the way through the dish, little Mai became dubious about the lack of 'healthy _things_' in the dish and scrutinised the 'train' too closely, quickly discovering the offending vegetable poking its brightly coloured edge out of the potato at which point she quite stubbornly refused to open her mouth, ignoring the attempts of the 'traitor' to sweet-talk her into finishing the meal. \"C'mon Mai! just three more forkfuls and you can have your pear and raspberry crumble... you'll hardly taste them, I promise!\" Allen wheedled with little success. Dumbledore glanced up from the _Daily Prophet _that he had summoned from his office after realising that this break was going to drag on for a good few more minutes wondering how exactly the young boy would cope in this situation- he had been raising the child for some time now, but he was still young...\n\n\"Mai, I am not joking, if you don't open up, you'll get no dessert... I'm not going to move till you eat it\" Mai however firmly pressed her lips together and shook her head. Allen let out a frustrated sigh \"_**Mai Walker, you open up your mouth **__right __**now or so help me, I will ban you from playing with Timcanpy for a whole week!\" **_Allen said, his voice low and calm but full of authority- Dumbledore barely managed to stop himself from all out laughing as the two Ministry goons- who had been pouring over the machine figures- jumped at the sound of the authoritative voice, then flushed as they realised who it had come from. Little Mai seemed similarly effected and she obediently opened her mouth to receive the rest of her meal\n\n\"There\" Allen said gently, putting a hand on her head. \"That wasn't so hard was it\" The little girls bottom lip began to quiver and her eyes filled up with tears. Allen let out a gentle sigh and hugged the child to his chest. \"I'm sorry for frightening you Mai, but you need to learn...\" he proceeded to give the girl a little lecture on how important vegetables were and how he loved her and wanted her to be healthy, Dumbledore continued to watch them, completely fascinated- this Mana must've been a brilliant parent he thought suddenly as he watched Allen wipe away the little girls tears and begin to feed her the crumble- To have taken a rough street child, full of bitterness and replace it with this kind, responsible boy within the space of just a few years.\n\nAllen all of a sudden let out a gasp which cased every adult in the room to spring to attention\n\n\"_TIMCANPY!\" _he cried, suddenly spinning round in his chair, frantically scanning the room for... what exactly? \"I can't believe I didn't notice- he wasn't- of course he must still be- he is going to KILL ME!\"\n\n\"Err\" interrupted a rather bemused Dumbledore \"Who exactly are you talking about?\"\n\n\"It's not a who, it's a what... ah he is going to eat me alive when he gets here\" Allen fretted, being frustratingly obtuse\n\n\"Will you _please_ tell us what on earth you are on about!\" Dumbledore said exasperatedly\n\n\"Ah- yes- well, you see, I have a... pet?\" He seemed unsure of his word choice \"I don't suppose you saw him when you rescued me Professor? He is about this big\" He held his hands cupped together to form a small sphere \"covered in metal, with wings and a tail\" he looked expectantly up at Dumbledore who just shook his head in bemusement\n\n\"He must've fallen asleep in my bag... _my bag! _I can't believe I forgot about that too! Sir...\" He glanced up at the Headmaster pleadingly. Dumbledore let out a small sigh\n\n\"Contadina?\" There was a crack and a house elf suddenly appeared in front of Dumbledore\n\n\"Yes, Sir\" the house-elf squeaked in a strangely business-like tone\n\nDumbledore politely asked the elf to go to the place where Allen had left his stuff and to take it to the hospital wing, with the exception of this 'Timcanpy' which was to be taken to Allen\n\nAllen thanked Dumbledore fervently and let out a sigh \"I can't believe it took me so long to notice...\" He bent down and gently tugged the gold plate that Mai had resumed playing with out of her hands \"You can't play with this Mai\" He said firmly \"It's not a toy and it belongs to the school\" Mai pouted moodily but relinquished her hold on the plate. Allen handed it to Dumbledore who waved his wand causing it to disappear. Mai's eyes grew large as saucers as she witnessed this and she gazed up at Dumbledore with something akin to hero worship in her eyes. Dumbledore chuckled merrily and waved his wand again, conjuring up bright, multicoloured rings of what appeared to be semi-solid smoke. When Mai tried to touch one, it would shy away from her grasp, floating on the eddies of air that her movement caused. Little Mai let out a squeal of delight and proceeded to chase the rings around the room, completely absorbed in her little game\n\nAllen watched her for a few moments with an amused expression on his face before returning to his chair and sitting down in it again. The door to the room opened again and three more house elves scurried in, baring trays laden with finger-foods, little pastries, cheeses, crackers and an abundance of other nibbles. They set the trays down on the little table they had brought in earlier on and whispered \"Just in case sir gets hungry again\" before throwing nervous looks at the ministry officials and scurrying off, shutting the door silently behind them.\n\n\"Right- you _finally _ready to start again?\" Fredrick snapped. Without waiting for an answer, he tapped the machines again with his wand causing the screens to flicker back into life and the lines to flurry into life, racing along the screen as if they were as eager for answers as their masters\n\n\"Let's go\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen didn't start speaking strait away, pausing for a few moments, seeming unsure of where to begin. He ran his hand through his hair and let out a small sigh \"Err, it may be easier if I explain all the facts to you first and then if I tell you how I found it all out, my discoveries were kind of jumbled and disorganised so if I explain things in a chronological order- it will make very little sense\" He glanced up at Fredrick who gave a huff of exasperation but nodded.<p>\n\n\"The man- or thing- that appeared to me at Mana's graveside is called the Millennium Earl. He forms part of the family of the 'Noah', they gave themselves this name because according to the bible, there was once a flood which destroyed all life on earth except for Noah and his family. Noah was therefore the father of all humankind. The Millennium Earl's wish- it is thought- is to see a repeat of this event. He wishes to become the head of a new world, to bring this about, he has discovered a way to bind deceased human souls to these metal bodies that make up the 'Akuma'. Seemingly though, he cannot create one on his own. He needs someone with a strong personal link to the soul to cry out for them to come back with all the longing of their heart. The Akuma feed on other human souls- that is what keeps them functioning, the more souls they eat the stronger they become. No one knows how many Akuma he has managed to make however it is known that there was a period of time when many hundreds were being made, some 13 or 14 years ago and then all of a sudden it all stopped. As far as we can tell, no Akuma- or at least very few indeed were made between that time and when he appeared to me.\" Dumbledore narrowed his eyes slightly, catching onto the change into the plural pronoun\n\n\"After this, some more appeared though at a significantly reduced rate. Akuma are created with some sort of strange substance, a dark material of some form. There is a counter-substance which can destroy this dark matter however, and it is called 'Innocence'. This is the substance that is in my arm, causing it to be the colour it is. This is why I was able to destroy Mana and... other Akuma. Though they are brought to life by the Dark matter, and are powered by it, they seem incapable of destroying Innocence. I have heard faint rumours though that this 'Noah' family I mentioned before truly exist- that there are a group of followers of the Earl that have the power to destroy Innocence, though I really have no idea if it is true or not- or if it is true, what these Noah are. They aren't Akuma- that much is certain for Akuma simply do not have that type of power, even after evolving\"\n\nThe door to the interrogation room suddenly opened and everyone- save Mai who was in her own marvellous world of make-believe- jumped, as they were suddenly snapped back to the present. The house elf- Contadina- appeared, bearing a round creature in his arms. Dumbledore looked at it curiously- it seemed to have been covered in a grey metal of some sort that made it look somewhat like a snitch- except slightly larger and with a marvellous tail. Allen let out a yell of joy and leapt up from his chair, hugging the winged creature to his chest \"TIMCAMPY! I thought I'd lost you\" He cried, he then promptly let out a yelp of pain as the creature bit down on his thumb hard with a set of rather frighteningly pointy teeth \"I'm sooo sorry!\" He wailed apologetically to the strange creature which begrudgingly let go of the boys thumb and- despite the metal weighing it down- flew up and landed on the boys head. Allen seemed unperturbed by this and sat back down with a pleased, if slightly pained, smile.\n\n\"That was quite good timing really, as I was just about to come to how I got all this information. You see, there is a group of people called the 'Black Order' who oppose the Earl. They search for fragments of Innocence which and also try to find Innocence accommodators- these are people who can fight using the innocence and there are very few. Once they are found, the scientists of the Black Order forge weapons out of the innocence. Each of these weapons is unique to the fighter, and once they are equipped with the Innocence, they are called exorcists. As far as I am aware, I am the only accommodator whose Innocence is actually part of his body- anyways, the people of this Order are very secretive, the only reason I heard about them was through the Akuma oddly enough. When I fought them, they would call me 'exorcist' and 'Black Order dog'. After some inquiries, I followed up on the vague rumours that existed about them. I struck lucky one day, I had been tracking down a group of Akuma but by the time I got there, the Order had disposed of them, however in the battle one of their communicators- Timcanpy- had been injured. They had left him there whether on purpose or not I don't know. I fixed him as best as I could and found out that he was still connected the Black Order Network. You see, Tim is a golem. They are creatures not unlike bats and can communicate with each other somewhat like a phone can. The network is obviously completely unhackable because only those with golems equipped with this metal suit which was created by Black Order scientists can link into the network. The golems offered their services to the Black Order in return for this capsule. Not only does it enhance their communication abilities by allowing them to link into phone networks to boost their own signal but it also protects their very delicate bodies. After I realised this, I started to use Timcanpy to hack into the Black Order network, I had to use some technology as well to ensure that they didn't notice and to access some of the higher-up's conversations but it was mostly Timcanpy's work. Through this I learned some more about what happened to me. I was very reluctant to join the order however, as it was very politically motivated. They didn't seem to care much about Akuma if they were just killing people. Instead, they concentrated all their efforts on gathering Innocence and only confronted the Akuma they met while doing so. They had no qualms about human experimentation and often blackmailed accommodators into working for them. However, money was running low for me and I wished to give Mai a better life. Plus I knew that with their superior equipment and knowledge, the Order were my best chance at properly opposing the Earl. This was why I travelled here. I had heard about an Order set up here in Britain ran by a man- Komui- who seemed sympathetic to exorcists and humans alike. I figured that if I was going to join the Order at all, I'd be better joining one with a good leader.\"\n\nHe let out a huge yawn and rubbed both his hands over his face in an attempt to wake himself up \"Akuma had begun to disappear from Japan you see, and appear here in Britain. This was the incentive for me to come. The Earl seemed to be on the move again and I wished to be in the best possible place to stop his plan- whatever it was- from succeeding\"\n\nHe glanced up at Fredrick \"That's more or less it\" he said awkwardly, rubbing the back of his head with his hand \"I think I covered most of the important stuff...\"\n\n\"Yes, well, we shall be the judges of that\" Fredrick said stiffly\n\n\"Dumbledore, if you will come with me? You boy- stay here\"\n\nHe spun on his heel and strode out of the room, his lackey trotting dutifully behind him, reels of paper s from the machines spilling from his arms as he went. Dumbledore flashed what he hoped was a reassuring smile at the exhausted boy before he left the room, his head reeling with all the information he had just been given. What on earth was the Ministry's reaction to this going to be?\n\n**Yes Necron, I DID just Stein-ify Dumbledore. You're welcome ^^**\n\n**A/N- Yea, I changed my penname in case you didn't notice- the old one was just a silly thing I made up when I wasn't writing anything- I felt I kindof required a more anime-ish name if I was going to become a fully fledged FF author!**\n\n**I believe I shall now actually stick to my plan of updating weekly. Not to be making excuses or anything but exam time IS coming up so I figure if I can make up a backlog of chapters I can keep you guys happy while still managing to (hopefully) pass my exams. I may pick up the updates after the exams but we shall see ^^**\n\n**Wish me luck btw- I am going to attempt to steal back my 2nd Harry Potter book from my fiendish friend who borrowed it a good few months ago -.- Don't worry though- If I don't get it back I will just borrow the book from the library :) **\n\n\n\t9. Chapter 9\n\n**Necron(slash, Mobius)- Yea, I have developed phycic powers ^^ **\n\n**Kureru- Sorry no :( this one is still rather sad, though you do get to see Dumbledore practically explode, which I guess is amusing. Next chapter will have lol's, Promise!**\n\n**Yea, Allen is a great dad isn't he!**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Maybe not for a while yet, depending on their length, the next two chapters at least'll be developing character relations and plot between wizards & Allen. I promise to dedicate a lengthy third chapter after that to awesome akuma-ness-ism ^^ (yes, that is a word)**\n\n**Shaybo27- Thanks muchly! And tada! Updated! :P hope you enjoy**\n\nOnce they stepped outside the room, the Ministry goon shut the door firmly and turned to face Dumbledore\n\n\"I shall need to get all this data to the ministry for the official write-up. We shall expect you at precisely 7 AM for a consultation and review. We will also need the medical report from your Nurse. Bring her with you when you come\"\n\nDumbledore frowned irritably at this commanding tone, furrowing his eyebrows and glaring heatedly at this puffed-up popinjay\n\nThe man in question visibly quailed under his stern gaze and gave a rather pathetic cough \"err, if that is all... yes I believe we are... indeed, well, err all is in order so um... yes\" He held out his hand to Dumbledore who coolly cocked an eyebrow and other than that remained perfectly still and stoic. The fool of a wizard gulped slightly, now perspiring vigorously and turned his gesture into an exaggerated check of his wristwatch\n\n\"We had better be going. Move it Harold!\" The lackey jumped to attention and scurried after his boss towards the fireplace in one of the classrooms where they both disappeared in a flurry or robes and green flames\n\nDumbledore gave a sigh of relief to see them gone. If he had stayed in their presence much longer, he believed he would have caused some severe damages that even the ministry would be unable to turn a blind eye towards. He glanced down at his watch- 6 hours to go till the 'consultation' enough time, he concluded to have a good nap and still fit in an hour to draw up new theories for all the information he had gathered in the past few hours. He yawned widely, this day had just dragged on forever, it seemed unimaginable that exactly 16 hours ago he had been in the Ministry with no knowledge of the boy or his fantastic tale at all.\n\nStifling another yawn he began to trudge his way up the corridor. He paused at the end, struck by a sudden thought; he stuck his head into the empty classroom beside him where he saw a house elf dutifully setting all the desks and seats into order for the next day\n\n\"Tiptree, could you do me a favour?\" He asked jovially, the house elf jumped and bowed low \"Of course sir! Anything\" Dumbledore sighed inwardly, no matter what he did or how hard he tried it was nigh impossible to get a house elf to speak to you as an equal. Contandina had been the closest he had gotten so far\n\n\"I want you to set up a futon or some such thing in the interrogation room for the boy there. Oh, bring in a cot and some toys for the little girl too will you?\" The house elf nodded energetically in reply\n\n\"Thanks awfully\" Dumbledore said \"I'm off to bed, please see to it that no one disturbs me unless there is imminent disaster and/or destruction about to occur. Night or rather, Morning I should say\" He gave a weary smile and shuffled his way off to his office and to the soft, warm bed that awaited him there.\n\nTo say that Dumbledore was angry would be the understatement of the century. To say that he was furious wouldn't be giving it true justice. In fact, comparing his current state of emotions to the notorious Tambora **(1)** would be rather unfair to the volcano\n\nThe two hapless ministry ignoramuses were practically shaking in their boots, faced with the livid headmaster\n\n\"_What\" _seethed the apocalyptic headmaster \"_where you thinking?\"_\n\nFredrick- rather annoyed that this man was able to make him feel like a two year old child caught in some act of disobedience- stepped forward and attempted (rather poorly) to put on his 'professional face'\n\n\"The child is a foreign fugitive, Dumbledore. You know the wizarding code as well as we do, you know we had every right to detain him as long as we wished\"\n\nDumbledore barely managed to restrain himself from seizing the numbskull by the front of his robes and attempting to shake some sense into his thick head. He settled for drawing himself up to his full height and standing toe-to-toe with the slimeball\n\n\"Well pardon me for assuming that you ministry baboons had some small, faded sense of humanity! I guarantee you if I had known that this was going on I would have rained down hell in the form of statutes and legislations on your heads- I think you will find that you are standing on very shaky legal grounds right now\"\n\nThe ministry goon gulped nervously\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>(30 minutes ago)<em>\n\nDumbledore rubbed at the bridge of his nose, he would need to go back to the ministry later and try to talk some sense into them. Having been presented with all the facts, the proof and the evidence they had done what he had feared- declared the young boy mentally unstable and therefore his story untrue and invalid. It had taken all his skills and in-depth knowledge of the amnesty and immigration policies for young foreign wizards to convince the idiots that the boy was no threat and should be allowed to stay. Normally, any wizard willing to leave their home country would be snapped up with no questions asked- the wizard communities were so small they accepted almost anyone that came knocking, though the ministry did, it appear, draw the line with the ones they considered a potential future risk.\n\nIt was so typical of the ministry, they probably had seen the truth in the boy's tale but as this was all happening in another country, they wanted nothing to do with it. They had had their fair share of psychopaths trying to take over the world thank you very much and they were not keen on having to deal with another so they did what all good governments do when faced with vital information about a potential disaster that wouldn't directly affect them. They ignored it. _Imbeciles_.\n\nAh well, there was nothing he could do for the time being. They had decided to wait and question Madame Pomfrey after Dumbledore was finished, due to her duties. Hopefully when she presented her findings from studying the boys arm, the ministry would at least have to contemplate the idea that he wasn't a lunatic.\n\nHe let out a little huff as he passed the hospital wing. He glanced down at his watch 12 AM, ah good, time for a bite to eat! At the thought of food his mind immediately turned to the boy. He should be awake now, special arrangements would need to be made of course for his insane appetite, he would need to talk to the house elves and maybe extend the magical field that transported food to the Great Hall so it included the Hospital wing too. He hummed lightly to himself as he wondered down the corridor and bumped into... Tiptree? The house elf looked extremely stressed- and was walking up and down the same stretch of corridor. He practically rebounded off Dumbledore and landed hard on the ground. Oddly enough though, the house elf let out a cry of joy at the sight of his assaulter\n\n\"Sir! Tiptree is so glad to see you Sir! Tiptree wasn't sure what to do...\" **(2)**\n\nDumbledore frowned slightly, it wasn't like Tiptree to speak of his own accord- in fact it wasn't like him to speak at all. Not unless it was 'yes sir, no sir, three-bags-full-sir'\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dumbledore inquired\n\n\"Well, you see Sir, Tiptree did as you told him and took the beds into the interrogation room but there were ministry officials in there and they ordered Tiptree to leave. They were questioning the young boy and Tiptree thought Sir didn't want this but Tiptree wasn't sure and there was no disaster or destruction so Tiptree didn't want to disobey...\"\n\nDumbledore stopped dead in his tracks '_surely not' _he thought desperately '_not even the ministry would' _\"Do you mean to tell me that the young boy is still being questioned\" He asked incredulously\n\nTiptree nodded his head up and down so fast his ears flapped against his head. He looked rather nervously at the headmaster \"Tiptree knew it\" He wailed \"Tiptree has failed\" He ran as hard as he could in the direction of the wall only to be caught by Dumbledore almost on reflex before he succeeded in doing any damage\n\n\"_You_ did nothing wrong Tiptree. You may return to the kitchens. Oh and you are forbidden from causing yourself any physical harm\" Tiptree nodded miserably and trotted off down the corridor. Dumbledore was still in a state of shock as he glanced at his watch, '_this means that they have been questioning that poor boy for...__**23 hours**_'\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>(Present Time)<em>\n\nDumbledore violently swung the door of the interrogation room open. The scene that met his eyes was unbelievable. There were maps, flip boards, charters, atlases, timelines, notes stuck to the wall with spell-o-tape joined with different colours of thread. It looked like a crime scene and in the middle of all this; Allen sat, still in the wooden seat that had been brought in at the beginning of this whole affair. He was dishevelled and messy- his hair standing almost straight up (he had obviously ran his hand through it many times) deep blue smudges had formed under his eyes and he looked about ready to crack up, his head gripped in both is hands.\n\n\"Now tell us\" The interrogator said coolly, completely unperturbed by the young boy's discomfort \"exactly how do you spell the name of the\" he glanced at his notes \"23rd circus you joined\"\n\nAllen let out a moan \"I have already told you\" he said, sounding almost at the point of tears \"I don't remember... I can't... I'm just so tired... I don't...\" He let out a small groan of frustration and ran both his hands through his hair, messing it up even more. He gripped fistfuls of his hair, tugging it hard in an attempt to wake himself up \"err... that would be the... ah... circo de los sueños infantiles **(3)**... or no, that was the one after it...\" He glanced up as he heard Dumbledore move into the room, his eyes widening when he saw him\n\n\"Sir! I'm so sorry sir\" he cried, desperation and hysteria creeping into his voice \"I just can't remember\" His red-rimmed eyes gazed apologetically up at the headmasters narrowed ones. Dumbledore quickly realised that now was not the time to bash the ministry moron's heads together. There would be ample opportunity to do that later. He walked over to Allen and knelt down, so he was eye-to-eye with him\n\n\"It's OK\" he said gently \"you've done very well indeed. Come on, we'll go to the hospital wing and you can get some sleep, all right?\" The boy nodded his head and stood up, swaying slightly. He reached his hand out to Mai who was in the corner playing with her toys, obviously having only just woken up from a nap, her hair still mussed and her sleep suit (courtesy of Professor Mcgonagall's transfiguration skills) still on. She toddled over to him and reached her arms up. The boy wearily knelt down to receive her and Dumbledore noticed that it took two attempts before the boy managed to gather together enough energy to straighten up with the added weight. He was going to _kill_ those morons.\n\nThey walked silently side by side to the hospital wing, Allen concentrating solely on walking in a straight line and Dumbledore concentrating solely on not turning round and hexing those idiots until even their mothers would be unable to tell the difference between their child and a Mimbulus Mimbletonia!\n\n**A/N, I am rather excited for uploading this because on OpenOffice (which is what I'm writing this on) the first paragraph break line thing is blue and awesome- don't know if it'll show up on fanfic or not though. If it does, I will be sooo happy!**\n\n**Apologies for how long this story is turning out to be, I have a feeling that it'll be like proper book-size by the time I finish. :/ ah well! (I think I may have made a bit of a silly mistake- my first ever fanfic and it is basically a novel!)**\n\n**The name of a rather angry volcano**\n\n**I know, I know, I may have made a bit of a mistake, I forgot to make Contandina refer to himself in the 3rd person, I know that is how house elves talk, but I just was silly and forgot :(**\n\n**I wont change it though because I can justify it- Contandina is one of Dumbledore's oldest house elves, and is therefore less of a suck-up than the others as Dumbledore encourages all his house elves to stand up for themselves. (P.S, you will notice this tendency in me- I tend to make silly mistakes and then justify them in round-about ways :P I'm guessing most of you didn't even notice, but hey, there's your explanation)**\n\n**Apologizes to the actual smart people out there. Yea... google translate :/ sorry!**\n\n**Wish me luck again btw, 2nd attempt at getting my book back. -.-**\n\n**Still planning on only updating on Saturday's- but my dad is taking me down to England tomorrow, so... I figured it'd be better to update now rather than at 11 tomorrow night :)**\n\n\n\t10. Chapter 10\n\n**OK, I have just realised that I haven't been putting that disclaimer things that most ff writers put in. Tbh, If you haven't realised by now that I am neither JK or Katsura Hoshino then you are a little bit stupid, I am not going to post this every chapter like most ff writers do because I am not that big headed nor do I think that you readers are stupid. I'll just throw it in this once. Yea. I'm not a professional author- more's the pity!**\n\n**Shaybo27- Ta muchly :) hopefully it'll go somewhere good- I hold high hopes... glad you enjoyed it**\n\n**Necron-I almost miss your constructive criticism...it doesn't feel right with just compliments!**\n\n**Kureru- Thank you so much! Here is a slightly lighter one anyway... I felt after all the seriousness it needed a little sillyness :P Hope you continue enjoying and any comments or suggestions are appreciated as always!**\n\n**Sammi117- Yea, I think I may have taken your words too literally- I think this may be my longest one yet! Glad you like the story ^^**\n\n**Shaybo27- The ministry is full of morons :P And thank you so much for the kind words, I hope you continue to enjoy it :)**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Next chapter Dumbledore will give Fudge a right dressing down :D Looking forward to writing it!**\n\n**777angeloflove- Thanks! And Tada! I'm hopefully gonna update every Saturday so hope you keep reading *puppy eyes***\n\nDumbledore left the exhausted boy off at the doors of the hospital ward and pulled Madame Pomfrey outside. She stood there tapping her foot in irritation giving him a look that could curdle milk\n\n\"And exactly who do I have to thank for half killing my patient\" she practically snarled, her eyes glinting dangerously. Dumbledore gave a rather nervous gulp- this woman was scary sometimes\n\nHe explained the situation to her and then- rather nervously told her that the ministry wanted to question her about the medical facts of the boy's condition. Her fierce look faded slightly, and she just looked rather concerned\n\n\"The poor boy, he has been through so much- I'm afraid my medical knowledge only validates his story. I noted as I examined him that his arm- well- it has obviously been like this for the majority of his life but it couldn't have been like it from birth. It has clear signs of dark magic but of what form I could only speculate. His eye on the other hand occurred later on, my spells gave me a rough time-scale and it would also coincide with his story\" She heaved a small sigh and smiled weakly at Dumbledore\n\n\"I will tell them about my findings, but you know as well as I do. The government will see what they want to see\"\n\nDumbledore shrugged his shoulders \"There is little we can do about that. If nothing else, perhaps your evidence will convince them to let me investigate as I wish. Not that they could have stopped me anyway- but I do like to make them feel like they are in charge\"\n\nMadame Pomfrey nodded curtly and marched down the corridor, rather reluctantly leaving her ward and charges behind\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry glanced up from the photo album Hagrid had just dropped off as the door opened. Allen staggered in almost drunkenly, clutching a struggling Mai in his arms. Harry stared in shock- Allen was white as a sheet with deep blue bags under his blood-shot eyes. He looked as if he had got into a fight with Devil's Snare and had lost. Badly. His hair and clothes were rumpled and untidy, which was odd because he had been so neat when he had left for questioning the day before. Allen's dull, tired eyes lit up slightly when he saw Harry<p>\n\n\"Harry! Hi! Could you do me a huge favour please- Mai stop wriggling now- I am just so...\" he fought back a yawn at this stage as if to emphasise his words \"...so... tiered and Mai only just woke up and she wants to play and I just...need...\" he staggered up to the bed and thrust an excitable Mai into Harry's arms before dragging himself over to his bed\n\nHarry looked at the giggling child he was now holding at arm's length away from him with a look of severe distrust on his face\n\n\"Allen!\" He cried nervously \"What on earth am I supposed to do with it. Her\" there was silence and after a moments deliberation Harry chanced it- taking his eyes of the child quickly to glance over at Allen's bed. The young boy had face-planted on top of the covers and was already fast asleep. Harry gulped nervously and looked back at the hyper child he was clutching in his hands. He had never had to deal with young kids before- all the parents at Privet Drive would have rather have entrusted their child to a mass murderer than allow a ruffian like him to baby sit. What if he broke her? What if she needed fed? Did toddlers even eat normal food? He looked at the little girl's angelic face and swore that she grinned at him- that glint in her eye looked anything but friendly. Harry all of a sudden found himself fervently wishing that he was back in the depths of the school with Voldemort again. At least then he had known what he was facing.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen very slowly worked his way back to consciousness. He lay still for some time in a half- asleep state, his mind reluctantly kick-starting itself again after the abuse it had suffered. He shivered slightly, realising that he was lying on top of his covers. The room was completely silent and Allen relaxed again, drifting in and out of a doze. For some reason his mind wouldn't let him fall asleep again- there was some little thought niggling away at him. Frowning slightly, Allen tried to figure out what is was. Something important... something he should remember... Mai! Allen sat bolt upright his heart thumping wildly '<em>where was Mai!'<em> Then it came to him, he had given her to Harry. Thank goodness. He let out a sigh of relief and turned around\n\nWhat\n\nOn\n\nEARTH\n\nAllen froze in place- paralysed with shock\n\nThe room had been turned upside down, the curtains around Harry's bed were knocked over, his sweets and presents scattered all over the room with brightly coloured wrappers coating the floor and beds like so many flower petals. The mattress of the bed was hanging drunkenly off its frame, forming a triangular fort with the floor in which the pillows had been stuffed. The blankets were in a bundle at the opposite end of the room and a metal medicine trolley was lying on its back like an overturned beetle, one wheel still spinning uselessly in the air\n\nTime seemed to stand still for a while as Allen just stared at the scene before him; unable to quite grasp what it was he was seeing. He blinked a couple of times and after reluctantly deciding that what he was seeing was not a sleep-deprived hallucination he tentatively made his way towards the bomb-site picking his way through potion bottles and sweet boxes. As he neared the bed he caught a glimpse of a hand poking out from under it. He squatted down and curiously peered under- Harry lay there, limbs askew snoring quietly. There were chocolaty smudges all over his face, one of them taking the shape of a familiar, small handprint. His hair was stuck up at an odd angle, held in place by more chocolate and his glasses were missing. Allen leaned forward and prodded his face repeatedly until the boy stirred\n\n\"Whuzzgoingon\" Harry slurred eloquently as he blurredly opened his eyes. He blinked owlishly for a minute before shooting upright\n\n\"Mai!\"\n\nThere was a clang and Allen winced sympathetically as Harry's head met the unforgiving metal underside of the bed\n\n\"Yes\" He said in a blasé tone\n\n\"I was sort of wondering what you had done with her too\"\n\nHarry groaned in pain as he gingerly felt the back of his head and edged his way out from under the bed\n\n\"What _I_ did to her? Me! I didn't do _anything. _That thing isn't human! Look what she did to me!\" He cried indignantly waving his arm dramatically at his face \"She got a hold of the table and knocked it over then she found the chocolate\" His face became a mask of horror and he shuddered\n\n\"Never, ever, let that _thing_ get chocolate if you value your life! She started to swing off the curtain and then your weird bird thingy joined in too and it fell over and I tried to stop her and she got a hold of my glasses..._my glasses_\" He started to frantically feel his way about the floor for his spectacles\n\nAllen watched him silently, at a complete loss for what to say. He glanced up and saw Timcampy perched on top of the overturned trolley, chewing on one of the legs of Harry's spectacles. He bit his lip hard and relieved the golem of its toy and handed them back to Harry who shoved them onto his face. Unfortunately, it turns out glasses and golems don't mix well and the frames now sat at an unnatural angle on Harry's face\n\nHarry now looked at Allen who he could- finally- properly see. The boy was shaking all over and he had the oddest expression on his face\n\n\"...Allen?\" Harry said nervously\n\nThe young boy let out a very strange sound, somewhat like the noise a kettle makes when it is left on the heat too long. Harry blinked in a rather confused manner- Allen was bright red and he was shaking even more violently now\n\n\"...err, are you... OK?\"\n\nThere was a violent explosion as Allen gave up at trying holding it in any longer. He fell to the floor, tears streaming down his face as he positively howled with laughter. Harry pouted huffily at Allen,\n\n\"It isn't funny you know! That child is freakishly fast and strong\"\n\nAllen attempted to contain his laughter but he was unable to and dissolved once again into hysterical giggles \"S..s...so...sorry\" He stuttered out between gulps of air \"It's just...you're... and she's...only four years old!\" he snorted at this point and clapped both his hands over his mouth in a vain attempt to hold in the laughter that was threatening to burst out again. He closed his eyes tight and tried to concentrate on taking deep breaths. After regaining some of his composure, he opened them again to see Harry sitting cross-legged on the floor with a moody look on his face, a small smile tugging stubbornly at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"You quite finished?\" he asked grumpily. Allen wordlessly nodded, not trusting himself to speak again. At this point, the small bundle of pillows under the mattress-fort moved and Mai appeared out from under it obviously having been disturbed from her game by the sounds of hilarity. She let out a squeal of delight as she saw her Papa finally awake and she trotted over to him, throwing her arms around him. Allen looked up at Harry again who was gaping at the child before him apparently having lost the ability to speak\n\n\"How do you DO that? She wouldn't come to me even when I bribed her with chocolate!\"\n\nMai giggled delightedly as she saw Harry \"Papa, I like that one, can I keep him?\" she questioned innocently, gazing up at Allen who had once again clapped his hand over his mouth, trying to hold in the gales of laughter that were threatening to bubble over again. Harry scowled in irritation at the boy\n\n\"Oh, shut up you!\" he muttered, as the boy started to snigger again \"S'not my fault you have some magical calming influence over that monster. I swear she was worse when you were asleep\" He glowered at the little girl\n\n\"Yea, you just keep pretending. I know your secret; you can't play all sweet and innocent with me _demon_!\" At this, Allen once again dissolved into hysterical laughter as he fell to the floor clutching his stomach groaning in pain\n\n\"aha... it hurts!...hahahaha\" Mai thought this game was hilarious and she too started to laugh lightly, her voice high and sweet as she joined her Papa rolling about uncontrollably on the floor. Harry attempted on principle to keep a scowl on his face but even his pride wasn't strong enough to resist the contagious giggles for too long and after a few minutes, his resistance crumbled and he too started to laugh along with his new friends\n\nThen the door of the ward flew open and a shadowy figure stood silhouetted against the frame\n\n\"What.\"\n\n\"Have.\"\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"DONE TO MY LOVELY WARD!\"\n\nHarry, Allen and Mai all gulped simultaneously. Madame Pomfrey was back!\n\n* * *\n\n><p>2 Hours later, a rather subdued Harry and Allen sat on the end of the bed they had just finished making, both simultaneously slumped back to lie parallel to each other letting out sighs of exhaustion<p>\n\n\"I never want to see a scrubbing brush again in my life\" Allen groaned draping his arm over his eyes, shielding himself from the light that was streaming over the bed from the window as the sun made its last dying effort to blind the castles occupants before succumbing to the darkness of night.\n\n\"I know what you mean\" Harry muttered, trying to keep his voice low so _she _wouldn't hear them and find something else that needed cleaned. \"I feel like my arms are about to fall off\" He moaned lightly and rubbed his hands over his face\n\n\"Why didn't she make Mai clean? It was _her _fault anyway\" He glanced over to the other side of the room where a now-clean Mai lay sleeping peacefully in a cot\n\n\"Mind you, the prefect bathrooms were a real treat. If she hadn't threatened to scrub us herself unless we were in and out in less than 15 minutes, it would have been almost relaxing!\"\n\nAllen grunted in agreement, stifling a yawn \"I've never seen anything like it before. Magic is pretty awesome you know. Insane and illogical, but freaking awesome!\"\n\nHarry laughed \"Yea, you got that right! You know, the first bit of magic I ever did was shrink a disgusting second-hand bobbled jumper of my cousins till it was too small to fit a doll\"**(1)** He chuckled at the memory\n\n\"My aunt tried to force it over my head but it just kept getting smaller and smaller. Thankfully she thought it had just shrunk in the wash or I'd have been in trouble- my uncle and her don't take kindly to magic at all. They were positively livid when I got the letter inviting me here\"\n\nAllen rolled over onto his stomach and perched his chin on top of his hands \"You were raised by your Aunt and Uncle?\" He asked curiously\n\n\"Well, yeah\" Harry said awkwardly \"I thought everyone knew about me\" he said almost to himself\n\n\"New guy, remember?\" Allen teased lightly\n\nHarry smiled at this \"Well, you see, my parents were murdered by a dark wizard called Voldemort. He tried to kill me too but he didn't manage\" Harry swept back his bangs and gestured to his scar.\n\n\"That's how I got this\"\n\nAllen's smile faded \"I'm sorry\" he said simply, realising there was no other comfort he could offer\n\nHarry shrugged slightly \"Isn't your fault. I never really knew them. Must be so much harder for those who lose the ones they know\"\n\nAllen's face fell further. Harry noticed his change in demeanour and plucked up the courage to ask the question that had been bugging him for quite some time\n\n\"Sorry to ask you this, I know I hated it when people asked me, but where did you get your scar Allen\"\n\nAllen was immediately thrown into a silent inner turmoil, he trusted Harry completely of course but Madame Pomfrey had told him that Dumbledore didn't want him speaking of Innocence or anything connected to it until the ministry thing was sorted out. After some deliberation, he decided to settle for half the truth\n\n\"I was orphaned at a young age too, I never knew what happened to my parents. After some time I was adopted by a circus clown and- similar to you- a dark wizard named the Millennium Earl killed my adoptive father and left me with this scar and the white hair\"\n\nHe gave a sad smile to Harry who nodded in understanding. They lay for some time, each wallowing in their own thoughts and wordlessly appreciating the understanding between them. After a few minutes had passed, Harry let out a wry chuckle. Allen looked over at him and raised one eyebrow questioningly. Harry smiled and shook his head\n\n\"I was just thinking, what is it with dark wizards and pathetic names, I mean '_Voldemort' _and '_Millennium Earl' _come on! If you're gonna be a tyrannical overlord, you need to at least have the creative ability to come up with a better name than that!\"\n\nAllen smirked, his silver eyes lighting up slightly again \"you know, Voldemort means 'flight of death' in French\"\n\nHarry laughed outright at this \"That is horrible! He may as well have called himself 'Lord Doom'\"\n\n\"Or Shadow King\" Allen joined in\n\n\"Destroyer\"\n\n\"Avenger\"\n\n\"Dr. Death\"\n\n\"Nightshade!\"**(2)**\n\nBoth boys continued fabricating more and more ridiculous names, neither one able to fully let go of the sadness within their hearts but both taking comfort in the knowledge that they were not alone in their suffering.\n\n**A/N**\n\n**Yea, apologies to any HP fans that know better but I think I remember this being one of Harry's earliest performances of magic though I couldn't remember which book it was I read it in so I am not 100% sure (Still don't have my 2nd HP book back yet -.-)**\n\n**Copywrite warning in advance- these names have probably been used in 1000+ stories :P No offence to all the authors who used them... but yea...**\n\n**Can I have some thoughts please, I would like to know what you guys think about my chapters- I am fine with continuing the way I am going but I notice that it is moving a bit more slowly that a good story perhaps should. Do you like it this way or would you rather I skipped over some of the character development and less- important**\n\n**parts so I cant get on with the real story?**\n\n**P.S. Wish me luck again. 3rd attempt to get by book back :/**\n\n\n\t11. Chapter 11\n\n**Necron- Spoilers! Can't give away everything, then you'd have no incentive to continue reading :P**\n\n**sammie117 and 777angeloflove- Thank you! That one was quite fun to write ^^**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- I know right? They are indeed terrifying creatures. And I can't tell you yet, mainly because I haven't quite decided . I was considering on leaving them out for a while yet as Allen didn't meet them till he was 15 so I was going to wait till the 4th year but we shall see. It may change yet**\n\n**Kureru- So glad I managed to cheer you up- Maths is never fun :P Hope you enjoy this one too!**\n\nDumbledore ignored the wooden chair that had been oh-so-kindly set out for him by the Ministry officials who were all of a sudden fawning over him as they realised the true extent of their mistake in questioning Allen. Dumbledore smirked slightly as he conjured up his favourite purple chintz chair. He absolutely _loved_ the 'protection of underage wizards' Act of 1975, though he had a nagging suspicion that Fudge was going to change it now after the issues it had just caused him. He had been quite ready to kick the poor boy out of Britain and back into Japan without so much as an apology however Dumbledore had been kind enough to point out that if he did so, a lawsuit big enough to make the most seasoned layer quiver would land on his desk. At this, Fudge had rather quickly reviewed his plans and came to the conclusion that perhaps it wasn't such a bad idea to allow Allen to stay after all.\n\n\"So\" Dumbledore said calmly as he settled down in his chair \"What have you decided\"\n\nFudge cleared his throat and began to re-align the quills on his desk in order of height and nib-thickness\n\n\"We have come to our decision Dumbledore. We have concluded having seen the medical reports and having heard the boy's testimony that he was indeed injured by dark magic. This obviously addled his brains, causing the hallucinations and delusions about these so-called 'Akuma' and this 'Earl'. As for his arm holding magical powers, this is clearly poppycock too- seems to be a further delusion of his...err... unstable mind. We have however decided that as he has so far shown no signs of violence that he is not currently any danger and therefore can be allowed to mingle with the general public. If that changes, if we get even the slightest whiff of anything suspicious, we will have to send him to St. Mugo's. It's for everyone's protection really.\"\n\nDumbledore smiled and nodded \"You know, minister\" He said pleasantly \"You are without a doubt the most excellent politician I have ever met. Your ability to dress up this pile of dung in pretty frills and ribbons just proves that the public most definitely made the right choice when they elected you. Rest assured that I will, as I have always done, pick up the slack and make up for your incompetence by actually acting on this information. If you wish to remain in government when this whole thing blows up in your face, I would suggest you let me do as I wish. I assure you, I will allow you to take the credit as always so there is no need to be concerned\" He stood up and, with a barely perceivable flick of his wand caused his chair to disappear and a small gust of wind to sweep over the ministers desk ruining the neat alignment of his quills. Dumbledore smiled inwardly at this childish victory and swept away before Fudge realised that it had been him.\n\n\"Oh, and by the way\" Dumbledore said just before he exited the room\n\n\"The boy is coming to Hogwarts. I shall assume that you have enough common sense to realise that that is the best place for him and therefore will set no more petty bureaucratic obstacles in my way. I am rather bored of skirting around paperwork at this stage. Adieu\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"No\"<p>\n\n\"...So Professor McGonagall will sort out... wait, what?\"\n\nAllen folded his arm stubbornly across his chest \"I came here to fight Akuma and save as many souls as I could, Professor. No offence or anything but I fail to see how exactly I will be able to that effectively if I am in a classroom writing down 101 ways to tame a dragon or whatever it is you teach here\"\n\n\"There's actually only 1 really, and we don't teach it here anymore- the health and safety regulations were a right pain in the...\" Dumbledore trailed off, his eyes sparkling slightly\n\n\"Regardless, Allen, you must come to school. You have magic and if you don't learn to control it, you will just be putting your life and the lives of those you love at risk. You are still young, enjoy your childhood while you can- you are entitled to happiness just as much as anyone else. Besides, it is illegal for untrained wizards to run around Britain getting up to who-knows-what. The Ministry would never allow it\"\n\nAllen shook his head stubbornly\n\n\"There is no way- I don't care if I am breaking the law doing it, I refuse to sit here being pampered while there are people and souls out there suffering because of my selfishness. I am a child no longer Dumbledore- age is not something that can be measured in years, but rather by experience and I have experienced enough Dumbledore, believe you me, I have experienced enough to remove the child in me completely.\"\n\nDumbledore sighed deeply, he had been afraid of this. There was nothing for it- he couldn't let this one slip the net- he had too much potential. He held too much promise. Perhaps he had been wrong about the prophesy after all, perhaps this child was the key to all his questions. There was no way he was going to allow him to disappear now. He was going to have to do the thing which he promised himself he would never do. He was going to have to make an exception to the rules\n\n\"What if I gave you the freedom to leave when Akuma appeared? You managed to uphold jobs while in Japan and still fight Akuma, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to do the same with education. The school will be funded for you, you will have an allowance provided for all the equipment you need as well, so money will no longer be a worry for you. Besides, you never know, what you learn here may help you to save more people in the future- having an extra weapon never hurt. Plus if you joined us, you would no longer need to sacrifice your ideals. We do not perform illegal human experiments or prize politics above life. You would still have the freedom to save souls regardless of whether or not some bureaucrat considered them to be important\"\n\nAllen frowned and sat in silence for a while\n\n\"Can I think about it?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry and Ron made their way towards the fat lady's portrait, scarcely believing they were still alive and in one piece after their adventure. Hermione was waiting for them, an extremely disapproving look on her face and her arms tightly folded across her chest<p>\n\n\"...Irresponsible and childish! Oh by the way, Harry, you _missed_ it because you were away being clobbered half to death by a tree but remember that boy you told us about? The one from the hospital wing? Yes well he has been sorted into Griffindor. He is in our year actually, turns out he fast tracked by sitting the 1st year exams over the summer holidays. His little sister is here too, turns out Dumbledore adopted the both of the so she is staying in the...\"\n\n\"WHAT?\" both Harry and Ron yelled, identical expressions of shock and horror on their faces\n\n\"Dumbledore ADOPTED THEM?\" they both cried in disbelief\n\nHermione sniffed at their reactions \"yes, well that _was_ what I just said wasn't it? Honestly, you two are so immature sometimes- why shouldn't Dumbledore adopt?\"\n\nRon snorted at this \"Because he is ancient and a complete and utter crackpot that's why!\"\n\nHermione shot him a rather condescending look before choosing to ignore his comment \"Anyway, they are both inside if you want to...\" She was once again rudely interrupted as both the boys barged past her into the common room, gaining access through the portrait that she opened for them as she followed rather huffily behind\n\nHarry managed to get through first, and he immediately picked Allen out from the crowds of people there. Mainly because almost every single Griffindor had gathered in a semi-circle around him and were bombarding the poor boy with so many questions that it was impossible to discern one from the next.\n\nAs soon as Harry climbed through the portrait, Allen's face split into a grin \"Harry!\" He cried causing the entire common rooms attention to turn on him. Harry gulped nervously and glared at Allen who mouthed '_sorry' _from his spot behind the pack of people who all simultaneously began asking questions about his crash landing in the school grounds\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry, Allen and Ron eventually managed to escape from their schoolmates and ran into their dorm. They all slumped down simultaneously on the floor, laughing rather giddily at their situation.<p>\n\n\"So\" Harry said, turning to face Allen \"You were _adopted_ by Dumbledore?\"\n\nAllen laughed lightly, rubbing the back of his head rather sheepishly \"Yea, well, it was the only way he could convince me to stay at school- see I told him on no uncertain terms that Mai came above everything in my books, even my education so the only way I would come here would be if Mai could come too. Of course that is against the school rules but Dumbledore found some loophole somewhere that stated that the headmaster could bring his children to the school regardless of their age so he adopted both of us. It's purely to please the paper pushers- I mean it isn't as if he acts as a 'dad' or anything; he is more of a... guardian? A sensei? I still have full responsibility of caring for Mai, although she is looked after by Madame Pomfrey while I am here or in class. He just provides us with the place to stay and in return I have to promise to come to school and work hard\" He shrugged \"seemed like a good deal to me!\"\n\nHarry and Ron were both dumfounded\n\n\"What is his house like\" Ron asked, completely out of the blue \"I just can't imagine him _living_ anywhere\"\n\nAllen laughed again \"I know what you mean! His house is, like a huge mansion on this sea cliff it has the biggest grounds you have ever seen and it's all overgrown and wild like a jungle. The house itself is mental- It's full of these really weird metaphorical things, like as soon as you walk in the front door, there is this huge tree, growing out of the hallway floor. It is almost reaching the ceiling and is a deep mahogany colour, with dark red leaves shaped like stars- its leaves are constantly falling down and being reproduced. I made the mistake one day of asking him why it was there and he launched into-and I'm not even joking- an hour long lecture on how it symbolised the futile struggles of nature and humankind, for the tree was reaching for the unattainable sun, that it signified the resilience of nature for it was slowly cracking the man-made stone of the floor, that he enjoyed walking across the carpet of leaves and wondering over the endless cycle of life and death, each causing the other for the leaves which fall off the tree provide the nutrients for the next generation. He also said he thought it was marvellous that the tree had created its own universe, that it surrounded itself by shooting stars, and then after all this he just gave me a rather funny look and said 'plus I thought it was pretty' and wondered off to make himself a cup of tea\"\n\nRon and Harry both sat in a stunned silence before Ron piped up \"Yup. He is most definitely barmy\" and with this deep and philosophical statement, he began to dig through his trunk looking for his pyjamas\n\nAt this stage, Seamus and Dean burst through the door to the dorm, deep in conversation. As soon as Seamus spotted the boys in the middle of the dorm, he froze and turned to face Dean, muttering something under his breath. The two boys then continued into the dorm in silence, shooting a rather dirty look in Allen and Harry's direction before sitting on their beds and sorting through their stuff. Harry was rather bemused by their behaviour- he had always gotten on well with the boys and couldn't figure out what was wrong with them. Allen who of course didn't know them at all stood up and stretched,\n\n\"Well, I don't know about you lot but I am exhausted!\" He rummaged through his trunk and pulled out a wash-bag before shuffling off to the dormitory bathroom\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Dean let out a 'tch' of disgust when Allen exited the room and rolled his eyes at Seamus who returned the gesture \"Just our luck to be trapped in the same room with the freak huh?\"<p>\n\nHarry looked over at Ron, who gave him an equally confused look back\n\n\"Err, what are you guys on about?\" Harry asked\n\n\"That white-haired freak- he gives me the creeps. People like him shouldn't be allowed in schools, _I _certainly don't want to be in the same room as him\" Dean snorted in agreement and shook his head in disgust \"Can't believe Dumbledore actually let him in\"\n\nHarry bristled at this comment about his new friend \"Neither of you even know him, how can you judge someone like that without ever speaking to them? Allen is a great guy\"\n\nSeamus shot Dean a rather dark look \"Have you two even _seen_ his scar? Don't you know what that sign means? It is the sign of the most evil and dark magic that has ever existed. I don't even want to _know _how he got it! Even You- Know- Who didn't meddle with that branch of magic\"\n\nDean nodded in conformation \"Me and Seamus met up over the holidays and we saw an article about it in the Daily Prophet. I'm telling you, that boy is dangerous\"**(1)**\n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other, both thinking the same thing\n\n\"_How exactly had Allen gained that scar?\"_\n\n* * *\n\n><p>When Allen wondered back into the dorm, dressed in a shirt about five times too big for him (which came in handy as the sleeve finished well below his fingertips) everyone had already settled down in their beds with the curtains drawn. The room was awkwardly silent, as if all the occupants were holding their breaths- there was no snoring or heavy breathing. Just silence. Allen made his way slowly to his bed, unsure of what to make of it. He sat down on the end of his bed and glanced around the dorm again but the red hangings of all the beds remained shut, enclosing their occupants in their crimson cocoons. Allen shook his head, and told himself he was just imagining things. They must all have been tired. It was late after all. He rolled into his bed and pulled his own curtains shut.<p>\n\nTwo beds away, Harry lay his eyes open, staring blankly at the room of his four poster bed, his mind a million miles away. He remembered what Allen had told him about his scar all those months ago. But he had been so vague, who was it that had given him it? What wizard was there that had dabbled in magic darker than anything even Voldemort would venture into? And how on earth had Allen gotten mixed up in it. Sleep was a long time coming to him that night as suspicions and thoughts swirled around his head like unchartable constellations and galaxies\n\n**A/N (1) I am putting this prejudice in here because of how Seamus and Dean acted in the 4th book. They didn't strike me as the most accepting of people**\n\n**So yeah, I am going to assume that if you are reading this, you already know the Harry Potter books back to from like I do so I will be able to shorten this story slightly by leaving out any of the irrelevant stuff like what happened during Harry's summer- you know, the whole Dobby incident, car wreck issue etc etc. **\n\n**Also, I will I think re-post my question over the next few chapters to see what you guys think and if it is fairly evenly split, I'll just continue at the pace I am going**\n\n**review 1- if I am going too slow and 2- if I am going at the right pace and 3- if I am going too fast (though I sincerely doubt that I am going too fast)**\n\n**Thaaaaanks so much to all of you lovely reviewers btw! ('')**\n\n**Oh and in case anyone is curious, apparently the green goblin that haunts my friends house has eaten my 2nd HP book . still. Borrowed one from the library so all is fine.**\n\n\n\t12. Chapter 12\n\n**Kureru- Thanks so much ^^ hope you enjoy this one too. Thanks as well for that website, turns out that my book has vanished into thin air so I definitely need it **\n\n**777angeloflove- I know right? Dean and Seamus are meany faces :P**\n\n**sammi117- Tada! Hope you enjoy this one too**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- He'll survive with great difficulty- just wait till I get Draco involved in this too :D**\n\n**Here is the fight scene I know a whole bunch of you have been asking for. I hope you enjoy it!**\n\nExplosions of red, blue and green burst across the black expanse as Allen scrunched his eyes tight shut, causing the supernova's to explode across his eyelids. He opened his eyes and exhaled, long and slow as he coiled his body up, crouching low to the ground. With an explosive movement, he flung his body into the air, back arching to form a 'C' shape, arms lifted high, and fingertips searching. They enclosed around the branch of the tree he had his back to and with the skill of a trapeze artist, he swung his body up, pausing momentarily to gain his balance before bounding from branch to branch with reckless speed till he reached one that lay in line with the roof of a small, decrepit cottage.\n\nHe crouched on the branch for a moment, back pressed against the trunk of the tree as he pulled out his wand and muttered a string of protective spells**(1)** against the cottage and its occupants. Once his incantations were finished, he stored his wand back in his pocket and stood up, one arm touching the trunk of the tree, the other lightly brushing the branch as he calculated his trajectory. At this moment, his eye suddenly activated, the gears whirring as they informed him that three level ones were approaching from the East. A grimace passed across the young boys face. Three levels ones.**(2)** He _had_ faced that many before but it had been a difficult fight- he just hoped that he was stronger now. With a silent prayer sent up to the starry expanse spread out above him, he pushed off the trunk and sped along the branch, feet never faltering once, automatically adjusting to the uneven surface beneath them. With a burst of energy, Allen flew across the gap between the tree and the house, landing cat-like on the ridge, hands gripping the bulge at the apex of the tiles tightly. He immediately turned to face his opponents who could only be seen by their black outline in the skies as they blocked out the silvery pinpricks of stars in the black canvas. A bead of sweat ran down the Allen's cheek as he waited for his enemies to reach him.\n\nAllen pressed himself flat against the roof of the house, gripping onto the ridge to keep his balance as he waited for the Akuma to get close enough- he was going to need the element of surprise against so many opponents. He raised himself up slightly so he was ready to leap up over the peak of the roof. He quickly wiped his forehead against his sleeve and waited, tension curling in his stomach like some restless beast. 30 meters, 25, 20\n\n\"_Innocence\" _He whispered \"_ACTIVATE\" _With that cry, he vaulted over the roof and catapulted himself towards the approaching Akuma, swiping the nearest with the claws of his activated arm, puncturing its metal skin and using the explosion caused by its destruction to launch himself towards the second one.\n\nThe Akuma dodged his attack and Allen landed lightly on the ground, crouching as low as possible before leaping back up and twisting gracefully in the air, soaring over the Akuma, to land momentarily on the tree behind it then using the trunk as a launching pad to rocked towards its back. The third Akuma flew in front, blocking Allen's attack and it began to shoot, twisting its cannons to face the young boy. Allen gasped and quickly contorted his body to avoid the shots coming his way, thanking his stars for all his days as a gymnast in the circus. He carried along his trajectory, now too close for the Akuma's bullets to reach him, and he swiped with his claws at the doll-like face of the creature, almost subconsciously looking up at the young man's twisted soul that was chained to the terrible creature's body.\n\n'_I will free you!'_ Allen thought, desperately hoping that the poor person's soul would soon be released from its terrible fate. The claws of his hand caught the Akuma's face, but the power behind the attack had been lost. Allen quickly pushed off, soaring high above the Akuma's head and using gravity to his advantage as he hurtled back towards it, and at the last minute, twisting his body round again catching his claws in the top most part of the Akuma then allowing gravity to do the rest of the work, dragging his body down, and so, splitting the Akuma neatly in half.\n\nAllen landed heavily on the ground, panting from exertion. All of a sudden he heard a rushing sound and instinctively flung himself out of the way. The ground where he had been a moment ago exploded with a vicious force. Purple flashes of energy from the remaining Akuma flew towards him in heavy succession, forcing him to dodge and roll around the clearing, unable to get enough time to form a counter attack. He turned around to face his enemy, skidding to a stop. His grey eyes widened in shock as the purple cannon fire was reflected in them- heading straight towards him. He raised his cursed arm, catching the bullets in it, the force knocking him further back. Allen quickly swung himself around again and ran for the cover of trees, hoping the enclosed space would remove the bulky creature's manoeuvrability. Unfortunately, the Akuma caught on to his plan and sent his cannon fire towards the tree directly in front of Allen, causing it to explode. Allen yelped and once again skidded to a halt, throwing his arms up to protect his face from the shrapnel. He winced as some of the bark lodged in his arm and spun around again to face his enemy- trying his utmost to concentrate on the bulbous body rather than the soul chained to it. It was a child. This realisation hit him like a physical blow, the air in his lungs somehow felt deficient- like someone had punched him hard in the gut and he now couldn't draw a breath. He hated the young souls the most, it just made it harder to concentrate on the fight. With a conscious effort, he focused once more on the Akuma's body, just in time to notice that all the cannons were once again trained on him. With a gasp, he flung himself out of the way again\n\n'_this can't go on' _he thought desperately as he dodged another volley of bullets '_I need to launch an attack and get this over with before I sustain any more injuries'_ He glanced down at his arm. He sleeve was soaked in blood and the shock of the attack was beginning to wear off. The pain was beginning to take its place.\n\nAllen narrowed his eyes and dug his feet into the ground, crouching low while the Akuma waited for the dust to clear before it launched another volley.\n\n'_It's now or never!'_ He thought and with that, he pushed off the ground with as much power as possible, soaring through the dust clouds left by the last attack and striking the Akuma hard on its side before it had a chance to retaliate.\n\n\"Pitiful Akuma, may your soul be saved\" He cried, as he grabbed his cursed arm with his injured one, putting as much force behind the blow as possible.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen wearily headed back to the <em>Dustdevil <em>broomstick that had taken him to this location. Timcampy was flying in lazy circles above the stick, patiently waiting for the return of his young master. Allen gave one last check of the cottage he had left behind. Repairing the damage of the battle had taken some time, plus after checking on the elderly residents of the house, he had felt that he needed to help and so had spent a good 20 minutes repairing the leaking roof and damaged windows of the house. He glanced at his watch. It was 5 in the morning. He let out a weary sigh. There was hardly any point in going back to the dorm now, any sleep he would get would only make him more tiered. He swung his leg up over the large broom and wrapped the thick woollen cloak he had left there round his body, pulling the hood low over his head and stowing Timcampy on his shoulder under the cloak to protect him from the turbulence.\n\nAllen clung tightly to the handle of the broom, wishing fervently that he had brought gloves with him, he didn't think he would ever be able to prise his frozen fingers off this lump of wood ever again. He screwed his eyes up against the wind, even with the cloak he was chilled to the bone- though on the plus side, his arm wasn't hurting anymore or maybe it was and he just couldn't feel it. Allen shuddered- there is something intrinsically unpleasant about hurtling through the air at 50mph with only a stick of wood between you and... well... gravity. Thankfully the castle was now in sight. A hot showers and a cup of steaming hot chocolate waited inside. Allen's mouth immediately began to water at the thought. He was _starving_! He pulled hard at the broom handle to slow it down before he reached the outskirts of the grounds. The downside to such a speedy broom was that it took forever and a day to slow down plus if you wanted to turn, you had to do it about half an hour in advance which was a little bit of a nuisance to say the least. He had almost slowed to a halt when he reached the outer wall of the school grounds and after slowly prising his stiff fingers off the handle, he raised his index finger out into the air. Silver lines rippled lightly out from his fingertip and the shield that surrounded the school melted away in that section to allow him passage before sealing up seamlessly as soon as he entered.\n\nAllen crash-landed clumsily on the lawn outside the front doors. Grumbling to himself about uncontrollable broomsticks and the freezing weather, he heaved the broom over his shoulder and slid through a concealed side-door in the wall of the castle\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The searing hot water slowly coaxed Allen's blood into circulating properly again, thawing out his frozen limbs. He stood beneath the torrent of water, his eyes shut, relishing the sensation of feeling again. With a deep, contented sigh, he opened his eyes and started to pick out the wood splinters in his arms with his teeth, nipping them out and spitting them into the basin of the shower. The water swirling around his feet took on a pinkish hue as his blood mingled with it. Yawning widely, Allen stepped out of the shower and dried himself, gingerly edging his way around the myriad of small cuts that covered his arms and legs before smearing a pale green gel (courtesy of Madame Pomfrey) over the worse cuts and changing into a set of freshly laundered robes.<p>\n\nHe padded his way across the ward floor and entered the small side-room that was now Mai's nursery. She lay, sleeping peacefully in the cot, her breathing light and steady. A soft smile spread across Allen's face and he made his way across the room, sitting down beside the cot and leaning his head against the railing. He slid one arm between the bars and laid it gently on the little girl's soft cheek, the heavy weight on his heart lightening almost immediately. The images of tortured souls and battle torn lawns faded away till all that was left was the slow, steady breaths of the sleeping infant. Allen closed his eyes and allowed himself to relax and drift away, his breathing slowing to match that of the slumbering child's. Not quite asleep and yet not quite awake, he drifted in the land of half-dreams until Madame Pomfrey bustled into the room to get Mai up for her breakfast. The sudden sound startled both the children into wakefulness and Mai's eyes lit up immediately as she saw who was by her bed\n\n'PAPPA!' she cried joyfully, reaching her arms up to him in a silent plea to be released from her prison.\n\nLaughing lightly, Allen obliged, swinging the little girl around in large circles before enveloping her in a hug and kissing her gently on the forehead\n\n\"Good morning, Denka\"**(3)** he said cheerily, \"How is my little princess today?\" Mai giggled and wrapped her arms around her Pappa's neck\n\n\"I am happy because you are here\" She said smiling \"I didn't see you lots and lots a'cause you weren't here Jibo\"**(4)** she frowned disapprovingly at Allen \"How come you were not here!\"\n\nAllen gave an apologetic smile \"Papa was working, Mai. I have worked lots of times before haven't I? This is no different. Tell you what though- I'll come see you at break time today alright? I'll take you outside and you can see my friends. Remember Harry? You'd like to see him again wouldn't you?\"\n\nMai's eyes lit up as soon as Harry's name was mentioned and she nodded wholeheartedly.\n\nAs Allen passed the Mai over to Madame Pomfrey and made his way down to the dinned hall he wondered if there hadn't been something in what Harry had said after all- a rather scary light had come into that little girls eyes as soon as she heard his name!\n\n**OK, so Dumbledore taught Allen a whole bunch of spells over the summer which is why he knows some that Harry and co. don't learn till later on- these spells are similar to the ones that Hermione casts around the camp-sites in the last book and are just to protect the house and its occupants from harm as well as to send them into an enchanted sleep so that the noise doesn't wake them**\n\n**Just to remind you- Allen has had no training and is only 12 at this stage so three level ones are actually a difficult fight for him**\n\n**Princess**\n\n**Daddy**\n\n**Once again review 1 if I am going too slow, 2 if its OK at this pace :)**\n\n\n\t13. Chapter 13\n\n**777angeloflove- tanx muchly :) I will try to keep their relationship up but I think I may have to sacrifice some cute moments in the interest of moving the story along at a reasonable pace. Please keep me updated on how you think my speed is so I can know when to move it along and when to add some character development :P I know good writers are able to do both at the same time but yea... I'm not quite there yet!**\n\n**Sammi117- sorry :s I know I am quite bad for waffle- just keep nagging at me and I will try to improve my pace ^^ Glad you enjoyed it though**\n\n**Kureru- I miss my book too... it may have been defaced one too many times by by younger siblings and it may have been falling to pieces but it was mine! :'( still, it'll turn up eventually... I hope! Thanks for the review, I wasn't so sure if I was putting him at the right level, but I hope to improve him at a reasonable pace through the story :)**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Hmmm, I like this idea... I may indeed have that at some point- I have a confrontation between Allen and Draco in here so I could tie that in somehow... thanks for the suggestion!**\n\nHarry and Ron joined Allen and Hermione at the Griffindor table both yawning widely.\n\n\"Why were you up so early?\" Harry asked curiously as he helped himself to sausages from the platter in front of him. Their section of the table was filled with twice as much food from any other section to cater to Allen's enormous apatite. The first time Harry and Ron had seen him eat they had been completely gobsmacked that someone so small could fit so much food in his body. He had told them when they asked that his curse mark devoured much of his bodies power so if he didn't eat large amounts of food, it began to use up his life force. It took them a while to wrap their heads around the idea but soon they just accepted it and had quickly learned the best way to deal with it was just to fill their plates as high as possible before Allen cleared the entire table.\n\nAllen poked his head around the mountain of food piled in front of him and quickly swallowed the three muffins he had crammed into his mouth\n\n\"Oh I was just down visiting Mai\" Harry's face noticeable paled as he shuddered with the repressed memories of that fateful day. Allen smirked evilly \"Yea, I haven't been able to spend much time with her recently so I told her today I'd take her out at break so we can all play with her outside\" He quickly ducked back behind his heaped plate before Harry could protest and began to once again shovel his food into his mouth at an alarming rate. Harry groaned and buried his head in his arms, trying not to think about what horrors awaited him\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen lent his head against the row of seats behind him, staring up at the azure blue sky with his lids half shut as he waited for Harry and the rest of the team to come out. If he'd had it his way, he would still be sleeping but <em>no<em>- Ron had forced both him and Hermione to come down to the pitch as soon as he had realised Harry was gone from the dorm even though it was only... he glanced at his watch. 7 in the morning. He let out a low moan and flopped back onto the seat behind him. Ron's dedication to his friends was admirable but come on! It was the weekend for crying out loud! Plus he still hadn't caught up on the sleep he had missed due to his night-time escapade. He heard Ron call down to Harry and sat up in his seat to wave down at his friend, teasingly brandishing the basket of food he had brought with him. Harry childishly stuck his tongue out at Allen before mounting his broom and speeding off after George and Fred. Or perhaps Fred and George. He couldn't really tell. He had only just managed to start on his 5th egg roll when the Slytherin team made their way on to the pitch. Allen frowned \"I thought Wood had booked the whole pitch out\" He mumbled through a mouthful of food\n\n\"I think he did\" Ron said grimly, pointing to a very irritated Wood who was hurtling through the air towards the sliver and green team \"Let's go\" He said, vaulting over to the partition between the stands and the field. Allen grabbed his basket of food and exchanged a quick look of exasperation with Hermione before following the red-head as he ran towards the stand-off between the two teams.\n\nAllen watched, vaguely amused at the petty fight that was unfolding before him. He picked through his basket and got about halfway through his bacon roll when\n\n\"...you filthy little Mudblood\" A shocked silence fell over the company. Allen glanced over at Harry who looked about as confused as he felt\n\n\"What...\" But Allen got no further, as the entire Gryffindor team exploded into cries of outrage. Allen turned just in time to see Ron pull out his wand but before he could intervene, the red-head yelled out a spell he had never heard of before\n\nAllen glared at the Slytherin team as they all howled with laughter gritting his teeth, he didn't know what that insult had meant but he could make an educated guess. There was no _way_ he was letting them off with insulting Hermione and humiliating Ron.\n\n\"_Silencio Maximus\"_**(1)**He cried pointing his wand at the team before turning to run after his friends who were headed towards Hagrid's, leaving the Slytherin team standing dumbstruck behind him. Literally.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen and Hermione made their way towards the library together, Ron and Harry having just left for their respective detentions. They were just heading down the corridor when Malfoy passed by, purposely knocking against Allen's shoulder as hard as he could, catching him by surprise and making him fall hard on the ground.<p>\n\nMalfoy sneered down at the boy as Hermione knelt down to help him up\n\n\"You'd better watch your back, _freak_. The Slytherin house don't take kindly to people who get too big for their boots\"\n\nAllen narrowed his eyes at the blonde boy \"I think you must've been sorted into the wrong house then, Malfoy\"\n\nThe smirk disappeared from Draco's face and was replaced by a scowl\n\n\"You'll get yours, you little brat. You and your Mudblood girlfriend\" With that he turned on his heel and stalked off down the corridor. Allen opened his mouth to yell after him but Hermione gently placed her hand over his mouth, silencing him.\n\n\"Don't rise to it Allen, he's just angry because it took the Slytherin team two hours before they managed to get their teacher to understand what you did to them and to remove the spell. Plus they had to miss their practice for it\" She giggled slightly as she held out her hand to Allen, helping him to his feet again\n\n\"I know what you did was against the rules and all, but I just wish I could have seen their faces. Where on earth did you learn to do something like that?\"\n\nAllen sheepishly rubbed the back of his head \"Dumbledore taught me that spell along with a few others over the summer\"\n\nThe pair continued on their way to the library \"So what other spells did he teach you\" Hermione asked curiously, tilting her head to one side.\n\n\"Oh there were a few different ones\" Allen said evasively \"The most difficult one to learn though was conjuring up the essence of metal, it took almost the entire summer to learn it\" he reached up to catch Timcampy who was circling his head.\n\n\"I used it on Timcampy to turn his body gold\"\n\nThe two students continued on side by side, as Allen explained the spell to Hermione- how it replaced one type of metal with another. He had made a deal with Dumbledore that if he mastered the spell before the new school year, Dumbledore would buy a gold necklace to allow him to replace the majority of Timcampy's body with the gold from the necklace. Both were so engrossed in their conversation that they completely forgot to turn off at the library and ended up almost walking into the wall at the end of the corridor before realising their mistake and having to retrace their steps.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen and Hermione both exited the library a few hours later with books stacked as high as physically possible in their arms. Allen craned his head over the top of his pile so he could see where he was going<p>\n\n\"Can we stop off at the hospital wing?\" he asked, glancing over at Hermione \"We could maybe even grab a bag from there for the books so we don't end up falling flat on our faces\" He smiled cheerily at her \"Plus I promised Mai I'd read her a bedtime story tonight. If I break my promise, she'll eat me alive\"\n\nHermione shrugged her shoulders, nodding, then her eyes suddenly widened- her movement had unbalanced the pile of books which all at once began to wobble unsteadily before toppling over all at once, causing her to fall to the ground. Allen started forward instinctively to help her which caused his pile of books to unbalance and fall over too. He tripped over his own feet as he tried to catch the books before they hit the ground and he too landed on the ground beside Hermione with a thud.\n\nThe two teenagers dissolved into giddy giggles at their ridiculous predicament. Once he finally managed to get his breath back, Allen flipped upright sitting cross legged on the floor and began to re-stack the books into four smaller piles to make it easier to carry.\n\n\"So\" Allen continued \"As I was saying before we so gracefully collapsed on the ground, do you want to come and see Mai with me?\"\n\nHermione smiled and nodded her head enthusiastically \"Sure thing. She is such a sweet kid that she makes me almost wish I had some brothers or sisters too\" Allen laughed out loud at this \"Harry definitely doesn't feel that way\" he said jokingly\n\nHermione chuckled too and picked up her pile of books \"Come on, we'd better hurry- it would put a bit of a damper on things if you were to be brutally murdered by your 4 year old adoptive daughter because you turned up late for her bed-time story\"\n\nAllen nodded seriously and they both made their way as quickly as possible towards the Hospital wing, jostling each other on their way as they both tried to beat the other to it.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry lay on his back, staring at the roof of his bed. That voice he had heard... there was no <em>way <em>he had imagined it. So why hadn't Lockhart heard it too? And what had it meant? He rolled out of his bed and made his way over to the window. There was no way he was going to be able to sleep now. He sat on the deep, old fashioned windowsill, allowing the gauzy curtain to fall down, shielding him from the view of the rest of the dorms occupants. He leant his forehead against the cold glass, running over and over the events in his head, trying to come up with some explanation for that voice- one that preferably _didn't_ involve a blood thirsty monster. All of a sudden, there was a creaking sound and the dorm door slowly opened. Harry immediately snapped out of his daydream and turned to look at the source of the noise, his heart in his mouth. It was _Allen!_ The young boy tiptoed his way across the floor, avoiding squeaky floorboards with practised ease. He was dressed in the long, baggy shirt he always wore to bed but in his arms, he held what looked like a winter cloak and a black outfit that was most definitely not the voluminous school robes everyone else wore. Allen glanced warily around the dorm; his eyes passing without pause over Harry's hiding place before he eased his trunk open and slipped the bundle of clothes inside it then tiptoed over to his bed and slipped between the closed hangings.\n\nHarry slowly let out the breath he had been holding\n\nWhat had Allen been doing? And then a much more worrying question, did it have anything to do with that voice he had heard?\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen headed down the stairs, balancing three or four baskets of food in his arms and was in the midst of a heated debate with Hermione<p>\n\n\"It's _rude_, Allen- you _know_ ghosts can't eat\" Allen glowered at her\n\n\"If I don't eat, you won't be able to hear one word of Sir Nick's death-day speech because my stomach will drown out every word! That'd be much ruder, trust me\" The two bickered amicably between themselves as they made their way down the stairs. Ron gave and irritated huff and turned to face Harry\n\n\"I wish those two would stop arguing- it's so nippy!\"\n\nThe group of teenagers had to stop for a good 5 minutes after this comment to give Harry enough time to recover from his hysterics\n\n\"I still don't get what was so funny\" Ron huffed as they started their way down the stairs again with Harry trailing behind them, still giggling weakly\n\nAllen shrugged silently as he worked his way through his second basket of food. Hermione just smirked slightly and exchanged a rather sheepish look with Harry.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The teens all huddled awkwardly together in the corner of the room trying not to think about the fact that they were outnumbered about five to one by the dead.<p>\n\nAllen stood nervously with his back against the wall, desperately hoping that his eye which was twitching rather confusedly wouldn't activate. He reached up his hand and flattened his bangs over it, trying to hide it from his friends who were now having some form of discussion with a rather depressed looking female ghost. He was just considering joining them when a burst of blinding pain shot through his cursed eye, causing him to bite back a cry and clap his hand to his face. He forced himself to lower his arm and concentrated with all his might on suppressing his eye to keep it from activating. Thankfully, his friends were completely distracted by the hoards of ghosts that were streaming in from the walls and causing the violent reaction in his eye. He winced as another wave of pain shot through his head.\n\n\"Hey, guys, I have a bit of a headache, I'm going to head back up and see the nurse alright?\" His three friends turned around\n\n\"Yea, sure\" Harry said smiling slightly, \"hope you're feeling better for tomorrow- potions first thing remember, don't you dare abandon me to deal with Snape by myself\"\n\nAllen nodded and started with surprise when Hermione placed the back of her hand gently against his forehead\n\n\"Poor thing, you are burning up!\" she cried and Allen silently thanked her for making his story sound more plausible- though it was true, he felt feverish with the strain of holding back his cured eye.\n\n\"We won't be far behind you mate\" Ron said grimly \"I'm not going to stay down here any longer than I need to\" He shuddered \"It's just too _weird_. Trust you to drag us all into something like this Harry!\"\n\nAllen quickly said his goodbyes and turned around, making his way as quickly as he could to the exit without running, one hand over his eye, as if he was hoping that by pressing down on it he could suppress the pain shooting through it.\n\nHarry watched suspiciously as Allen left. He knew that look all too well considering he had gone through the same thing many times. That strained smile, that subtle wince. Allen's curse mark had been hurting him. Harry wondered what was causing the pain- he had though his curse mark was one-of-a-kind, or at least Dumbledore had led him to believe so. Whatever had caused Allen's mark had definitely not been a killing curse like his because he was the only known survivor- so if it wasn't that, what was causing his pain? Everything was getting so confusing- things were going on that Harry didn't understand and it was beginning to frustrate him. He hated not knowing the full truth and he was determined to find out what it was that Allen was hiding, by whatever means were necessary. He _had _to know. He frowned slightly as he turned back to the procession of ghosts. Now all he needed to do was come up with some sort of plan...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>As soon as the dungeon door closed behind him, Allen relaxed and allowed his eye to activate; grimacing in discomfort and pain as it wildly swivelled in its socket, completely independent of its owner's control, searching for some unknown enemy. The eye pierced the thick stone of the wall, showing the ghosts up against the black background. Their souls were much nicer to look at than the Akuma souls, where the Akuma souls were twisted and in pain, these were strangely normal. They looked exactly like the ghosts did in real life, the soul were unchained and rather occupied the same space as the transparent body. The only slight difference was that the souls he saw were more solid looking than their owners. They all had the much more contented expressions on their faces than the Akuma souls he normally saw, as these souls had chosen to remain tied to this world of their own free will and were beholden to no one.<p>\n\nHe leaned against the door for a while, regaining his breath and allowing his eye long enough to realise that they were no danger before he deactivated it and staggering his way back up the staircase towards the dormitory. For some strange reason though, even once he exited the dungeons, his eye ached and seemed to want to activate again, the feeling continued to get stronger as he headed up towards the dorm but faded down again to a dull ache once he entered the common room. Allen sat in one of the chairs near the fire and kneaded his head with his fists, trying to ease the pain with no success. He was still seated there when all the Gryffindor's returned from the feast.\n\nAs soon as they entered, many ceased their urgent conversation when they saw Allen, sitting in his chair with undisguised suspicion and... fear? on their faces. In confusion, Allen looked around for someone who didn't look about ready to turn tail and run if he spoke to them. He walked nervously up to the Weasly twins who were chatting much more casually than the rest of the students with Lee.\n\n\"What, you didn't hear? Mrs Norris has been attacked\" one of the twins said when Allen asked what had happened\n\n\"Don't know who did it but I'd gladly shake their hand\" the other said \"That cat was a significant restriction on our fun\" Allen however could see by their faces that despite their light-hearted words, they were worried too. He thanked them and headed towards the dorm, pondering over what they had just told him. He was just passing Dean and Seamus when he heard them say, none too quietly\n\n\"Yeah, and where was _he_ when this all happened? Didn't see him at the feast did you? He was up here all by himself. If you ask _me_ the teachers would be better questioning _him_ than Harry of all people\"\n\nAllen continued on walking as if he hadn't heard but the words hit him like a physical blow, the spiteful words echoing round his head, making him sick to the stomach.\n\n_I wonder how much longer it will be _he though dully _before everyone turns against me just like they did everywhere else. I should have known it was too good to last_\n\n**A/N (1) Yeah- sort of made the spell up- in case you didn't figure it out- though I'm sure most of you did- it is just like 'silencio' only it effects large groups of people. **\n\n**p.s, so sorry for the late update- it has been a busy day- but I gave you guys an extra-long chapter to make up for it... am I forgiven? *puppy eyes* **\n\n**As always, any of you lovely readers who are kind enough to review... please tell me if you think my pace is too slow (1) or ok (2)**\n\n\n\t14. Chapter 14\n\n**Apologies in advance for the terribleness of this chapter- I'm not 100% pleased with it but I'm leaving in like half an hour and wont be home all weekend so I figured you guys would want _something_ rather than nothing. Still feel kind of guilty for uploading it- there are an awful lot of monologue scenes in here- promise I will improve the next one; I will maybe throw in an Akuma battle AND a Mai/ Draco/ Allen battle :3 I know right? I spoil you guys so much :P**\n\n**Necron- nooo silly- it was a _spell_ though the philosopher's stone was linked to the same magic **\n\n**Raycheall Dionzeros- Hopefully a confrontation next chap :) Though Malfoy does already know about Mai- I know I didn't make it very clear but it was announced to the whole school in the assembly Ron and Harry missed that she was staying in the castle**\n\n**777angeloflove- I know. They are meany faces aren't they! :( poor ickle Allen- oh wait... as I am the writer, I am the one torturing him... hmm... aha, my bad!**\n\n**Sammi777- No, I disliked them in the books too though so I may be OCing them slightly to make them worse than they are but with the way they reacted after the papers turned on Harry and Dumbledore in the 6th book made me think they were probably really gullible and judgemental about people... so yea... thanks btw- I think your the only one that thinks this pace is fine!**\n\nHarry and Ron made their way silently up the stairs to the dorm, both completely engrossed in their own thoughts. '_What could have done that to Mrs Norris, and why? What was the purpose of it? Was it a warning? A sign?'_ Harry rubbed his hands over his face and shook his head. It had been too weird a night, he couldn't wait to collapse into his bed and sleep for as long as possible. They entered the pitch black dorm and crept their way to their respective beds. Ron mumbled something like goodnight before collapsing into his four poster and began snoring almost immediately after.\n\nHarry was about to follow his example when a sudden thought struck him. He silently made his way to Allen's bed and stood awkwardly for a few minutes, struggling internally with himself. He was unsure what he was even trying to prove by checking but there was a little bit of him that just wanted reassurance. He knew that he should just trust his friend and that technically his presence in the dorm wouldn't rule him out as a suspect and yet... Harry raised his arm and gripped the curtains around the bed, took a deep breath and pulled them aside. Allen lay fast asleep, sprawled across the mattress his limbs askew in what looked like the most uncomfortable position ever. His face however was peaceful as a young child's with all traces of worry and stress completely absent. Harry let out a small sigh of relief, unsure of why exactly he felt so much better. He was about to drop the curtain shut when he noticed something. The curse mark marring the young boys face had darkened, but more disturbing than that, a dark mark traced its way down his left cheek. It was a blood red tear.**(1)**\n\nHarry sucked in a breath, unsure of what this meant. He wavered indecisively for a moment before dropping the curtain shut again and making his way back towards his own bed, the heavy weight once again settling heavily on his heart\n\n'_What was going on?'_\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The school was talking of little else other than the attack- already there were approximately 20 theories, 5 of which included conspiracies, 12 including some form of evil malignant creature or spirit, 2 blaming Allen and oddly enough 1 theory that Mrs Noris's soul had been sucked out by a makura-gaeshi<strong>(2)<strong> and that the only way to defend yourself from this creature was to carry a vial of sand around your neck. Yeah... despite the fact that people scoffed at this idea, there were a number of students with suspicious looking bulges in the front of their robes and the young girl**(3)** that dreamed up the idea was making a killing selling these small glass jars.\n\nThe attitude to which the majority of students were approaching this was odd to say the least- they seemed more than willing to buy all the 'protection' and debate over which theory was most likely but none seemed to actually be taking it too seriously\n\nHermione was another matter altogether. That girl was scouring the entire school to try and find a copy of her most prized book '_Hogwarts: A History' _The only other person taking it more seriously was Allen it seemed who was now spending an unhealthy amount of time in the library and was somehow managing to outlast even Hermione. The boy was getting paler as the days wore on and he seemed much less energetic than he usually was, even falling asleep in a few of his classes. The whispers from the students which had increased almost exponentially after the attack seemed to be affecting him more than they normally would and although he never retaliated to the digs, Harry could tell that it was upsetting him.\n\nPoor Ginny was distraught by the suspicions being cast on Allen as she had become fairly friendly with him and Mai over the year and was utterly convinced of his innocence despite her terror of the attack. Every time she heard some rumour about him or saw people shunning him, she seemed to well up- an odd expression coming over her face. She in turn clung closer to him when she could as if to prove a point to the rest of the school however they payed little attention and continued to invent theory after theory as to exactly how Allen had petrified the cat.\n\nThe internal struggle that Harry was going through was really beginning to grate on him. On the one hand, he was reluctant to believe that this gentle, well mannered boy could ever even be capable of causing anyone any harm and yet, there were the disappearances. Harry had snuck back into the dorm while everyone was down at dinner and had checked Allen's trunk to reveal a completely black outfit, complete with a balaclava and a pair of gloves- He couldn't think of any rational explanation for this and it just seemed like too much of a coincidence that Allen had been absent on both of the occasions when Harry had heard the weird voice. Plus there was the additional factor that he was very vague about the circumstances in which he had received his mark. Last of all, there were those which gloves which he always wore everywhere- Harry wasn't even sure that he took them off to sleep- his shirt was that long that you couldn't even tell. Allen had just told them that it was part of his curse but Harry needed to know _how_ and he needed to know _now.__**(**_**4**_**)**_\n\nHermione was being completely unreasonable about the whole thing and absolutely forbade Harry from investigating him anymore until they had ruled Malfoy out as a suspect. She seemed furious that they were even considering him as a suspect\n\n'_Did you even _listen _to Professor Binns? Salazar Slytherin's heir- Allen is in _Gryffindor _for crying out loud! How could he even be against half-bloods or mudbloods considering he doesn't even know his own parentage and Mai is muggle born?'_\n\nPart of Harry recognised the logic of what she was saying but there was still that niggling feeling of doubt- Allen clearly had something to hide and whatever it was, he was determined to find it out. Besides, he was in Gryffindor and the sorting hat had considered putting him into Slytherin... who was to say the same thing hadn't happened to Allen. He couldn't be the only one surely...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The cold wind blew through Allen's hair, whipping it back and forward across his face as he sat on the edge of the balcony outside the owlry, one leg dangling over the edge, the other folded beneath his body. He took a deep breath of the fresh air and closed his eyes, pondering over recent events. A dark force was growing within the castle. He could feel it as well as see its effect. Students were more subdued than usual and had taken to walking about in large groups. An increasing number of students were avoiding both him and Harry, they seemed to have come to the conclusion that as Harry had been the first to see find the petrified cat he must therefore be responsible for its current state. To a certain extent, Allen understood it- they were frightened and looking for someone to blame. What he didn't understand however was why Harry had started to avoid him also. He had become much more reserved than usual around Allen and his eyes seemed to become more guarded every time he saw him, it made no sense. He had just become used to the other students avoiding him, as his odd appearance set him apart anyway, it was only natural that they would begin to blame him for the strange things that had begun to happen but as for Harry, he had really thought he had finally found someone who could look beyond the white hair and scar. He let out long sigh and hugged his knees to his chest, resting his head on top of them. He closed his eyes, it was a good thing he was used to being alone, he had just begun to spend more of his free time with Mai or with Hermione in the library but deep down he missed the immature conversations and childish games he, Harry and Ron had played together. He had spent so long being mature beyond his years and it had felt good to be able to let go.<p>\n\nAs for the strange incident with the cat, it had seemingly been an isolated incident but was none the less disturbing for it. He couldn't help but wonder if Harry knew more than he was telling too- it was just a hunch but he had a feeling that something was being held back from him. He felt a pressure on his head and he reached up his hand to pet Timcampy, who seemed to realise that his young master was upset about something. The golem nuzzled against the young boys hand, nibbling gently at one of his fingers. Allen rubbed his thumb against the creature, smiling gently at it. The strain of keeping secrets from his friends was also playing on his mind. He knew there was no way he would be allowed to tell them the full truth, for if the ministry ever heard about his night time adventures they would land on both him and Dumbledore like a tonne of bricks. Still, he guessed it was no surprise that Harry was so untrusting **(pretty sure that's not a word)** of him, considering all the half truths he was telling them. He wondered for a moment if Harry could perhaps suspect something- maybe that was why he was being so secretive. Still, there was nothing he could do about it if it was true. Whatever he may suspect, there was no way that he would actually know the truth as Dumbledore had made the force field specifically so that only he could exit it.\n\nHe crossed his legs beneath him and rested his head on his hands, allowing his eyes to roam over the vast landscape before him, and letting his mind to wonder over less weighty things, his thoughts flitting from one thing to the next with no real purpose behind them.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen stared, eyes glazed at the front of the classroom as Lockhart demonstrated his 'wonderful defeat of the werewolf' for what seemed like the 50th time. With a grunt of annoyance, he pulled a book out of his schoolbag and began to quietly practice some charm work using the book like a shield as he levitated a glass bead to a couple of centimetres off the desk. Once there, he started to mutter spells, manipulating its size and colour while keeping it at the same height.<p>\n\nHermione rested her head on her hands, tilting her head to watch Allen instead of concentrating on the potions lesson she had been trying to memorise. He really was a lot smarter than people gave him credit for, what he was doing now was actually a pretty advanced technique. In fact, she was pretty sure than maintaining two spells at once was part of the OWL examination process. The fact that he had managed to cover an entire years worth of work in one summer was amazing enough, that he had managed to learn even more advanced spells on top of that was even more brilliant.\n\nHermione let out a little huff of irritation. She hated that Ron and Harry had become so suspicious of him. Boys were so childish sometimes- instead of just asking him about his disappearances or talking to him about his curse, they chose instead to keep their suspicions to themselves. She was sure that Allen had noticed how distant the two boys had become towards him but he hadn't said anything about it. She just hoped that this investigation they were going to do would pay off and that it would turn out that Draco was behind the attack after all so everything could return to normal. She wished more than anything that she could tell Allen about the plan, he was really quite talented at potions and he would be a great help but Harry and Ron had stubbornly refused to allow her to tell him. After arguing with them for some time, she had conceded defeat, relying on the results of the investigation to prove Allen's innocence.\n\nStill she was actually curious herself about his disappearances and why he had joined school a year late. There were a lot of things she didn't know about Allen and he was quite talented at talking a lot but saying very little. Still- he was her friend and she trusted him completely. Whatever his secret was, whatever it was he was hiding, it was not worth this unpleasantness. She wished there was some way she could convince Allen to just trust them but she knew from experience that things were never that simple. Especially not with boys- irritating idiots that they were.\n\nA smash startled her out of her reviver- Allen had finally lost control of the glass bead and it had shattered across the desk, scattering multi-coloured shards across the desk and floor. He flushed bright red and glanced nervously up at the teacher who thankfully was so engrossed in his dramatic defeat of Harry aka the werewolf that he was oblivious to everything else. Hermione smiled at Allen as he gave her a rather sheepish look. She swept her wand in an arc, gathering up all the shards of glass into a bundle before vanishing them. She sent a rather smug grin towards Allen and tried to ignore the heaviness of her heart. She hated hiding things from her friends.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen swung his bag up onto his back and headed out of the room. He was just about to thank Hermione for clearing up the glass when he noticed that she was standing at the front of the classroom with Harry and Ron. He paused momentarily at the door before continuing out to the corridor.<p>\n\nAllen was in the middle of searching for another book on magical creatures when he heard his friends' voices. He curiously poked his head around the bookshelf and saw the three heading with the head librarian towards the restricted section and returning with a rather menacing looking tome. Allen peered at the title as they passed '_Moste Potente Potions' _What on earth were they doing with a book with such a sinister title. They must've gotten Lockhart to sign for it somehow- not that that would be too difficult to do, that man was a complete imbecile. Still, that was a strange book for them to get out- he wondered if they were still trying to get to the bottom of this mystery. Though how on earth a potions book would help them he had no idea.\n\nHe had been searching for some time through the library in the hopes of coming across some clue as to what could have paralysed the cat. So far he had come across a few different types of plants which could conceivably have some sort of similar effect, however, they were all very rare and none were native to Britain. There was no way then that anyone in the school would have been able to get a hold of them. This had convinced him to move his focus onto magical creatures. He was fairly certain that whoever was behind the attack must be a resident of the castle. The writing on the wall was proof enough for that, plus the deliberate targeting of Mrs Norris. As for who was to blame, he had no idea. There were far too many students in the school to investigate them all and he was unsure how any student would be able to get a hold of or for that matter, control such a dangerous creature- if it even existed.\n\nHe knew that Harry, Ron and Hermione suspected Draco and to be honest, he suspected him slightly too. The boys family connections and wealth gave him access to things others would be unable to get a hold of but still... why would he do such a thing? Sure the guy was unlikeable, obnoxious and spoilt however to actually attack a defenceless creature unprovoked- it seemed unlikely.\n\nBut if not Malfoy, who then?\n\nSomething in Allen's gut was telling him that whoever was behind this, it wasn't a student.\n\n**1- For those of you who have seen/read man, this happens to Allen's eye remember when it gets all restless and wants him to hunt more Akuma... hinthinthint :D**\n\n**2- Well... this is a Japanese mythical creature and although stealing souls isn't really what it is renowned for (stealing pillows was actually it's sole purpose in life apparently- seiously) I decided that in the world I've created, it steals souls**\n\n**3- This is Luna btw, if anyone is curious. The makura-gaeshi don't really exist in the wizarding world but you know Luna...**\n\n**4- this isn't really an important point but just to mention, this is actually quite in character for Harry if you think about it- he really has a habit of being overly curious about everything and needs to know everything about everyone. I do not like this characteristic of his :/**\n\n**Apologies again for this fail of a chapter :( I promise it'll improve :S**\n\n\n\t15. Chapter 15\n\n**A/N ok, I failed again. Wrote this with the idea of making up for last weeks fiasco but I didn't manage to get an Akuma battle or anything in- though there is significantly more Mai... which is something I guess? I'm sorry- this time of the year is just insane with exams and stuff. I'm going to update this now and if I have any spare time today after revision I will try to get you guys another chapter with all the stuff I promised i.e. Mai and Malfoy throwndown + Battle written and updated at the end of the day or tomorrow coz I feel really bad about being so mean to you all :( **\n\n**777angeloflove- I know right? He is a proper meany face. He gets a little better in this chap**\n\n**sammi117- Thanks so much :) I just think I need to improve my writing so it's a better mix of soliloquise and action :P Thanks for the ego boost though ^^**\n\n**Raychaell Diozeros- Patience, grasshopper. All in good time :P**\n\nAllen craned his neck as he tried to see over the heads of the 3rd years in front of him, wishing that the Quidditch players would move the game higher up so he could see properly. Mai was completely oblivious to his situation as she bounced excitedly up and down on his shoulders- she had absolutely no idea what was going on but she knew that whatever it was, it was exciting and highly amusing. For some reason her pet (although he had refused to be her pet, she had decided to refer to him as such until he accepted it) was flying through the air on some stick or other being chased by a flying bouncy-ball. Why she had no idea but whatever the reason for it was, it made amusing viewing.\n\nAllen growled in irritation, why was everyone in this stupid school abnormally tall? He was about to give up and just resign himself to staring at the backs of the other students when he noticed a change in the attitude of the crowd. The Gryffindors' were all gasping and flinching in unison while the Slytherins' jeered and cat-called from the other end of the stadium. Allen reached the end of his tether and in desperation, climbed up on his seat to see Harry rocketing around the arena at breakneck speed, a bludger hurtling after him. He suddenly went into a dive- flying upside down to pass under the bludger however it just changed courses as soon as he evaded it and began pursuit again. Mai seemed to realise at this point that her pet was not playing and stopped laughing\n\n\"Jibo, what's happening?\" She asked, fear creeping into her voice but before Allen could reply, Harry swiped at the snitch and paused a fraction of a second too long, resulting in the bludger finally connecting with its prey and introducing it to the stark reality of gravity with an almost smug air of achievement.\n\nAllen whipped his wand out with speed brought on by desperation as Harry fell towards the ground\n\n\"Aresto Momentum!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry's brain barely had time to prepare him for the fact that he was hurtling uncontrollably towards the unforgiving ground before it realised that his swift descent had been halted merely centimetres above the muddy pitch. He caught a glimpse of Allen standing, his wand out stretched, heads and shoulders above the rest of the crowd with a look of shock on his face just before his mind, overloaded with pain, shock and confusion decided a reboot was in order and he blacked out<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>interlude where Gilderoy, Colin etc, etc happen...cbb writing it out :P (love you guys really...)<em>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Ron sat cross-legged on the bottom of Harry's bed.<p>\n\n\"... so Dumbledore knows who is behind the attacks\" he said, looking questioningly up at Harry\n\n\"I don't know, it sure sounded like it but if he knew who was behind it why didn't he stop them\"\n\nRon shrugged \"Maybe he doesn't know yet how the petrification works and is waiting to figure it out before he catches the culprit\"\n\nHarry hummed indecisively \"maybe. It doesn't seem very likely though\"\n\nFor a while the two discussed the strange behaviour of Dobby, both coming to the conclusion that unless the odd creature stopped trying to save Harry's life, he was probably going to end up killing him.\n\n\"You know though\" Harry said, he head ducked as he studied his hands \"I think maybe Hermione was right. I mean, Allen saved my life and... you know... he is friends with me and Hermione even though neither of us are pure blood, in fact now that I think about it, I think you are the only pure blood friend he has\"\n\nRon nodded with almost visible relief- he had disliked the tension that had developed between the two boys recently but his first loyalty was to Harry so he had backed him despite his reservations\n\n\"I'm with you there mate. Draco must've inherited the monster or whatever from his darling daddy- his family are loaded as well so that'd explain the whole Dobby thing. Does this mean we can get Allen to help with the pollyjuice potion? He is so much better at potions than me and to be honest I wouldn't mind some help, I'm getting sick of Hermione correcting my every little action\"\n\nHarry frowned as he pondered the problem. There was something huge going on here, the situation had all of a sudden become so much more serious. Whereas before people had been able to pretty much ignore the attack because, well, it was just a cat Colin Creevy's attack had struck the danger home. Now not only was there a psychopathic creature loose on the school but it was also targeting students. In addition most of the students of the school were linked to muggles somewhere in their blood-line, none but the Slytherins' felt safe from the monster. The Pure bloods were currently exuding-as impossible as it had seemed- more arrogance than ever before and there had even been a few incidents of sanguism. **(1)**\n\nHarry shook his head \"I don't think he has anything to do with this but we'd better be safe than sorry. He is definitely up to something dodgy, otherwise what is he doing disappearing randomly in the middle of the night?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen slowly peeled his gurdy-root out of boredom ensuring that it was even the whole way round before proceeding to cut it into perfectly even slices. If it wasn't for the giant bat of a teacher, potions would easily be the most enjoyable subject he had- it just confused him how people struggled with it. If you put the correct ingredients in at the right time, it worked and if you didn't it failed. Seemed simple enough to him, you just followed instructions which were even provided for you. He tipped the roots into the potion and stirred it 3 times anti-clockwise as the instructions told him to and smiled as it turned a brilliant periwinkle blue. He paused to let it simmer and glanced around the class who were all at least 5 steps behind him, even Hermione, who looked much more frazzled than she usually did.<p>\n\nNeville was almost 10 steps behind and was leaving his potion to simmer as he tried to decipher the instructions which was turning the liquid syrupy. Allen waited till Snape had turned his back to lecture Dean on the correct way to de-juice a puffer fish's eye before slipping over to Neville's potion and furiously stirring it clockwise, then anti-clockwise to loosen the mixture up again giving the round faced boy a wink and quickly dicing up his St. John's wart then adding it to the mixture before quickly running back to his own potion to sprinkle in some crushed horned-toad spikes.\n\nDraco was once again being an irritating idiot and was finding great amusement in flicking his extra puffer eyes at Harry and the rest of the group. Allen glared at him but knew there was no way Snape would even consider telling him off for it because after all, if you had money and prestige why should you be expected to act like a civil human being?\n\nHe turned back to his station trying to suppress his irritation as he chopped up his spare gurdyroot neatly and evenly to give Neville when he reached that stage. If.\n\nSnape began to sneer at Harry for his potion's consistency and- feeling slightly guilty for taking advantage of his friends bad luck- Allen ran back across to Neville's potion and handed over the perfectly cut roots and began to quickly whisper in his ear, guiding him through the instructions patiently. He was just about to duck his way back across to his own cauldron again when\n\n\"SIR! Allen is helping Neville, isn't that cheating?\" Draco smugly pointed across the classroom at Allen who had frozen mid-lecture as he pointed at the pile of mistletoe berries that needed to be crushed.\n\nSnape turned to face the two, his face almost gleeful. Allen and Neville both gulped simultaneously. This did _not_ bode well for either of them.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry let out a sigh of relief as Snape turned his back on him and proceeded to humiliate and lecture Neville and Allen in turn. He quickly dug the firework out of his bag and lit it, lobbing it vindictively into Goyle's potion. Just as Snape started to get into the swing of his lecture, the potion exploded with immense force showering the entire class but to Harry's great relief (though, if truth be told, slight disappointment), missing Snape.<p>\n\nThe class dissolved into chaos as the Slytherins who had been nearest the potion began to swell up and freak out. The Gryffindors, who had mostly been outside the blast area were creasing themselves with laughter and even Allen was having a hard time trying to look sympathetic as Malfoy tripped over his own feet due to the weight of his swollen head and landed flat on his face. Harry caught his eye over the heads of the class and his self-restraint crumbled as he dissolved into hysterical laughter along with the rest of the class\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen waved goodbye to Hagrid as he made his way slowly back up to the castle, Mai perched on his shoulders tugging his hair as she 'steered' him left and right across the path. Allen stretched his arms out at either side of him and began to make plane noises amusing Mai to no end.<p>\n\nHagrid had become a sort of surrogate grandfather for Mai, having fallen completely and utterly for the little girl. He took great pleasure in showing her through the grounds of Hogwarts and taking her with him on his safer game keeping duties, allowing her to see the bowtruckles when the first budded from the trees and the new litter of crup's that he was caring for in his hut till they were old enough to go to a good wizarding home. She in turn drank up all these strange and wonderful sights with immense delight and followed him around more than willingly asking question after question which he was more than happy to answer. They struck a very funny picture as they wondered through the grounds, the giant man striding through the thickets with the tiny Japanese girl perched on his shoulder or trotting along in his footsteps, chattering non-stop along the way.\n\nThe two reached the castle eventually and Allen let Mai down off his shoulders and she ran ahead of him through the doors. Laughing at her boundless energy, Allen ran in after her but when he entered the great hall, he saw to his surprise that Draco was standing there with his usual entourage of Crabbe and Goyle plus a few others that Allen didn't recognise. Allen frowned slightly, he had thought for sure that Draco would have gone home for Christmas but here he was.\n\nFeeling slightly nervous, Allen kept walking, hoping that they would just let him past but no\n\n\"Where do you think _you're_ going you freak? We told you you'd get your own didn't we?\" The group flanked him and he all of a sudden remembered who the others were- they were some of the Quidditch team who he had silenced after they insulted Hermione\n\n\"I don't want any trouble\" He said calmly \"Just let me past\"\n\nDraco shoved Allen hard against the wall and hissed \"I know it was you that exploded Goyle's potion in Snape's class. Did you really think I'd let you off with that?\"\n\nBefore Allen could shut himself up he said\n\n\"Tch, as if I would need to do anything to Goyle's potion to make it do that- the boy is so thick he wouldn't know the difference between a unicorn's horn and scarab eyes. He probably forgot to light the fire beneath his cauldron. As for you- did you even get hit by the potion?- your head is so swollen normally, I didn't even notice a difference\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence\n\nAllen was just a shocked as the Slytherins and he clapped his hand over his own mouth, his eyes wide. What. On. EARTH. Had he done that for?\n\n* * *\n\n><p><strong>(1) From the Latin word for 'blood'... basically like racism but wizard style ;)<strong>\n\n**Apologies again... hope the immensely irritating cliffhanger made up for the lack of substance *hopeful look* imma go now and study politics... Kthanksbye^^**\n\n\n\t16. Chapter 16\n\n**A/N Thank you all for being so lovely 3 nicest reviewers ever :P I know the last chapter wasn't my best and it didn't have everything I promised in it so here is you bonus chapter- Mai bashing and Akuma fighting complete!**\n\n**DISCLAIMER- This chapter covers extremes of emotions ranging from hilarious to depressing (soz about that)**\n\n**kirimoto- Yea, he resurfaces in this chapter too- I dunno, I sort of like him!**\n\n**Necron- ta muchly! And I know, it was mean... hence this bonus chappy!**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- was it? It wasn't intentional any way... my sub conscious must've been at work :P You'll need to tell me if you remember what movie it was from! All shall be revieled**\n\n**777angeloflove- He does seem to get blamed for most things doesn't he? Poor Allen-kun!**\n\n**Sammi117- One showdown cumin' right up ^^ hope you enjoy...**\n\nAllen was freaking out. No, that was an understatement, he was _beyond_ freaking out. He was petrified. The stunned silence didn't last nearly as long as he had hoped it would.\n\n\"_WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?\" _Allen gulped but before he could begin back-tracking, Malfoy grabbed him by the neck and slammed him up against the wall\n\n\"You are going to pay for that you, little ghoul\" Draco snarled as we raised his wand, pressing it against Allen's cheek \"I've been looking for someone to practice this new jinx on\" he said smirking slightly \"let's see how you suit purple pustules all over your face shall we? Not that it'd be a bad thing, it'd maybe cover up that hideous scar of yours, hey?\"\n\nAllen struggled against Malfoy but the other boys had grabbed his arms and legs, preventing him from moving at all. He snarled and glared Malfoy directly in the eye\n\n\"I'll still be better looking than you, you slime-ball\"**(A/N mm-mmm, I agree^^)**\n\n'_what am I DOING' _he mentally screamed, _this is NOT A GOOD IDEA- tormenting the person that had you pinned down with no way of escape, way to go Allen, now there's no _way _he's going to let you off with it'_\n\nDraco's smirk disappeared \"You asked for it, freak\"\n\nHe opened his mouth then\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAWWWW\" he dropped his wand and fell to the floor clutching his leg, screaming in pain\n\nThe Slytherin boys let go of Allen in their shock and looked about trying to find the source of Malfoy's pain.\n\nAllen staggered away from the group the second they let go of him, self-preservation kicking in at last. Once out of arm's reach, he glanced back curious about what had caused Malfoy to let go of him so suddenly. Mai was standing a few feet away from the boys, brandishing a... a _mace!_ Allen gaped in complete shock and looked from the spiked weapon to Malfoy. The boy was rolling around on the floor still hugging his leg to his body and howling at the top of his lungs.\n\n\"Don't be mean to my Jibo!\" Mai yelled at the boy \"You're just a stinky face so _THERE\" _\n\nAllen shook himself out of his stupor and ran over to Mai who was in danger of overbalancing herself as she shook the spiked weapon at the other boys, lecturing them on the proper way to behave. He scooped her up in his arms and relieved her of the weapon, giving her a quick peck on the cheek so she would know he wasn't angry at her. He pulled his wand out of his pocket with his other arm and held it out at the group of boys\n\n\"I won't say anything to the teachers if you don't, OK?\"\n\nThere was a short silence- the boys all looked at each other then down at Malfoy who was still writhing on the floor. They nodded their heads and Allen gave them a quick smile \"Thanks!\" he chirped and turned tail, running up the stairs as quickly as possible before they could change their minds.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen rounded the corner of the second corridor before daring to put Mai down and catch his breath<p>\n\n\"Where on _earth _did you get a mace Mai?\" He gasped, holding the metal weapon as far away from Mai as possible\n\nThe little girl shrugged unconcernedly, \"one of the metal men**(1)** was holding it but he wasn't using it so I borrowed it\" She looked up at Allen, brow furrowed \"why- do you think he'll be angry coz I didn't ask?\" Allen opened his mouth and shut it again, at a complete loss for what to say\n\n\"ah... no, I'm sure the... err... 'metal man' didn't mind just this once but just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't do it again if I were you. He might get annoyed\"\n\nMai nodded solemnly and Allen let out a sigh of relief- Mai was destructive enough on her own, add a mace into the picture and... He shuddered.\n\nBest not to think about it.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The stars were bright against the velvet sky as Allen swept through the skies silently, Timcampy soaring beside him, keeping pace easily. The two raced through the air, paying no attention to where they were heading. There had been only one alert on Timcampy's system and it had turned out to be a false alarm. Too restless to consider returning back to school, Allen had decided to scout the country side. The Black Order had too few stations to cover everywhere and there were many large areas with no finders staked. Although Allen knew it was impossible to save everyone, he decided that he was going to do all he could.<p>\n\nHence the scouting.\n\nA small smile graced Allen's lips as he tilted his head back, the bright constellations reflecting in his grey eyes as he took a deep breath of the cool air. For some reason the air always seemed so much clearer and more tangible at night.\n\nHe swept over small towns, amusing himself by imagining the lives of all the people in the houses and wondering what they would do if they could see him- a white haired teenager, impossibly suspended in the air being chased by a small golden golf-ball with wings. He chuckled lightly to himself and dipped the broom low over a large loch- he had no idea which one- he was now well and truly lost. He flipped the broom upside down and raised his hand above his head, allowing his fingertips to trail through the inky water as he gazed up at the endless heavens stretched out before him, his other hand firmly grasping the handle of the broom, preventing him from veering off path.\n\nTim lazily circled his master, unperturbed by the boy's odd behaviour\n\nAllen's eye suddenly activated and he jerked out of his stupor, returning both hands to his broom and righting himself. There were... 2? No, 3 level ones somewhere up ahead.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen pressed his lips together in a grim line as he lent forward on his broom, lying almost flat against it to reach full speed. As he neared the woods he pulled hard on the handle, forcing the broom to soar above the few sparse fir trees that were scattered haphazardly across the desolate moor. This was the last place he had expected to find Akuma, the place looked completely devoid of life. It was hard for Allen to pick out the dull grey creatures against the dark backdrop- the moon having inconveniently hidden behind a cloud, unwilling to behold such abominations. As soon as his eye picked out the souls though the camouflage was useless. He reached up one hand and unclasped his cloak, rolling it up into a ball and stuffing it along with his gloves into the small rucksack that he carried. He tugged it closed with his teeth before hooking it around the broom handle before flinging himself off into the night sky he reached the bulbous creatures.<p>\n\nThe wind whipped and whistled viciously past his ears as he plunged through the darkness towards the Akuma, his cursed arm wrapped around his head his other arm tight against his side making him as streamlined as possible. Just before he reached the creatures, he connected his mind with his Innocence and activated it. He curled his body up, fighting to bring himself to a crouch before reaching the creatures. His feet connected solidly with the first Akuma, driving it with immense power towards the ground, just before it crashed, Allen pushed himself off it landing for a moment on the side of the second before using it as a launching pad to reach the third.\n\nBlazing white crosses**(2)** appeared on the two Akuma he had left behind and they exploded one after another. The third had managed to pull itself together by this stage and began to shoot at Allen but he just continued to sprint toward the creature, body almost parallel against the ground as he ducked and dodged the violet cannon balls. He flung himself under one of the blazing balls that flew uncomfortably close over his head, landing hard on the dew soaked grass and skidding under the Akuma- cursed arm raised, cutting deep into its metal body. He flipped back to his feet and staggered away from the creature as quickly as possible before it exploded into flames.\n\nHe stood for a few moments his hands on his knees, panting heavily. Once his heart had reached an almost-normal pace he straightened up again and whistled the _dustdevil_ down from where it was hovering, rather dejectedly above the battle-scene. He tugged his rucksack open with his frozen fingers and pulled his gloves and cloak back on before trudging back off through the heath, curious as to why the Akuma had seen fit to come here of all place\n\n* * *\n\n><p>It took a good 5 minutes for Allen to come across a small stone cottage, with a caved in roof. It had clearly been derelict for a long time- the stones were weathered and filthy, the windows pane-less. Allen made his way slowly towards the dilapidated building, for some reason rather frightened of the impenetrable darkness that filled the house, spilling out of the gaping windows and filling the cracks of the brickwork. He ducked in under the low doorway blinking a few times to allow his eyes to adjust before edging further in. He licked his dry lips and reached into his pocket, pulling out his wand<p>\n\n\"Lumos\" He whispered- his voice abnormally loud in the oppressive silence. A weak beam of light spilled from his wand tip, illuminating the dirt floor, passing over a soot-blackened fireplace with the charred remains of branches coated in white ash spilling over onto the hearth. A bundle of grey blankets lay deserted on the floor and the air in Allen's lungs seemed to freeze, a searing pain shooting through his heart.\n\nIt didn't take long to find two piles of ashes, a few feet from the abandoned make-shift bed. The people clearly hadn't managed to get far. Allen let out a long shaky breath as he tried to gather his scattered emotions into some sort of order.\n\nHe forced himself to move, stumbling across the floor to the small, white mounds. He knelt down and closed his eyes, saying a silent prayer for whoever they had been, hoping that wherever they were now, they were happier.\n\nOnce he had finished, he walked over to the fireplace and picked up a handful of the branches that lay beside the hearth. He closed his eyes again and concentrated hard on all the transfiguration lessons he had ever had before clearing his throat and muttering a stream of spells under his breath causing the wood to mould itself according to his instructions. Once two simple urns had been formed, he released the magic and made his way across again to the piles of white dust that had once been living, breathing people.\n\nMana. Nalei. He bit down hard on his lip. _Get a grip_ he told himself firmly. Taking a deep breath and stealing himself, he scooped the remains of the two humans into the wooden urns, using magic to pick up the remaining layer of dust before sealing the urns seamlessly shut. He scrunched his eyes tight shut and tried to concentrate just on his breathing\n\nI_n and out, Allen. In and out. Don't think about it, don't think about it. In and out. In and out._\n\nOnce he had regained some semblance of control, he carried the urns outside, excavated two holes with magic and buried them, marking each with a simple wooden cross.\n\nHe turned his back on the two lonely graves and gazed across the barren landscape, now lit by the rising sun. The rays transformed the dreary heath into a blaze of orange and red. Allen smiled sadly as the warm sunbeams lit up the two small graves.\n\n\"rest in peace, strangers\" he whispered then turned and trudged back over to where Timcampy was waiting for him, the _dustdevil_ hovering patiently by his side\n\n\"Let's go home, Tim\" He murmured, wiping the tears from his face\n\n**A/N :'( *sniff sniff* sorry! I depressed myself with that chapter... I suggest reading the first bit again to cheer you up :P nothing like some Malfoy- beating to make you smile!**\n\n**(1)- metal man= suit of armour in Mai-speak **\n\n**(2)- cross grave move! Ah look at my Allen-chan getting all grown up *misty-eyes***\n\n**Hope this made up for the last chapter... even if it was slightly depressing :)**\n\n\n\t17. Chapter 17\n\n**Kirimoto- aaaaah! Shoooot! Erm... well in this story he just met him on his travels and the rest of that scenario played out the same way as in the anime. Sorry about that!**\n\n**Sammi117- Thank you! Glad the depression didn't put you off it completely :P**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Thanks yeah that part was fun to write ^^ I quite like Mai too :p If you remember what the quote was from you'll have to tell me. I am quite curious now as to whether it was subconscious because I've seen/ read it before or if I just came up with the same idea as someone else...**\n\nAllen stood in a little huddle with the other three **(A/N- I dislike the term 'golden trio'. Severely.) **as they all watched Snape and Gilderoy battling\n\n\"A bag of liquorice wands says Snape gets slaughtered\" Ron whispered to Allen out of the corner of his mouth\n\n\"Huh, not a chance mate, even I'm not dumb enough to take that bet!\" At this, Gilderoy was blasted off his feet to collide solidly with the stone wall of the classroom. Allen winced sympathetically\n\n\"And _that_ is why I would run a million miles before crossing wands with that overgrown, greasy...\" he shut up quickly before Snape came within earshot.\n\nAllen nervously bit the inside of his cheek. Snape was clearly still sore about the whole potions situation. He had paired Allen off with someone about twice his height and a good three or four times his width- Terence something or other. Deep inside Allen sniggered at the posh name paired with such a brutish boy but refused to allow himself to fall into the trap again of winding up the very person who was likely to flatten him at any minute. Although size was no real help when it came to magic, when low-grade jinxes and hexes were being used, the less... knowledgeable often abandoned their wands in favour of a well-aimed rugby tackle. Plus this boy was a year Allen's senior which did nothing to help his nerves. He licked his dry lips and tried his best to avoid the older boy's eyes which were narrowed intimidating at him. The guy already had the physical and seniority advantage over Allen- he refused to give in to phsyc warfare too.\n\nAt the teachers command, Allen bowed low to the Slytherin, back ram-rod strait. He heard the boy snigger and looked up rather confused- the rest of the students it seemed didn't even know how to bow properly and were settling for slight inclinations of the head or a sort of hunch-back pose. He was the only one it appeared who had actually been taught proper manners- though perhaps the culture in Japan had something to do with it but seriously! How difficult was it to do really? Common courtesy he decided was a rare thing in the UK.\n\nThe teacher began the countdown and Allen raised his wand to chest height, holding it lightly, almost like a conductor's baton, his wrist bent slightly- poised to shoot. The boy he was duelling however was one of the people who had some time ago decided that he was too superior to be expected to follow the same rules as the 'common folk' and as Lockhart reached \"2\" he yelled out some spell Allen had never heard before. Thankfully all those night time adventures had honed Allen's reflexes even further than his days in the circus and he managed to contort his body out of the way of the purple jet of light just in time. It hit Justin Finch-Fletchley who was standing behind him, facing Neville. The boy's ears immediately began to sprout copious amounts of hair. Allen whipped his wand up quickly before the Slytherin could pull it back together for another shot and yelled \"Locormotis Mortis!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Slytherin was unwilling to accept defeat and even with his legs stuck together, he raised his wand again. Allen swiftly yelled out another binding spell before the boy even had a chance to open his mouth and sent bandages flying toward him where they immediately bound his arms to his side and gagged him rather effectively\n\nAllen let out a sigh of relief \"Who would have known those healing spells would actually come in useful in a duel of all things\" he said to himself in shock\n\nHe didn't exactly get long to recover though before he was hit in the back by a spell that caused his legs to buckle underneath him. He twisted around, expecting another Slytherin to be standing behind him but instead he saw... _Justin? _Neville was standing behind him, his face shocked. Justin was glowering at Allen and said \"What do you think you were doing you freak? Hitting me with a spell when I'm not even your partner? What- do you think I don't matter just because...\"\n\nHe didn't get any further because at this stage, Ron's wand caused a miniature explosion, releasing copious amounts of a foul smelling green smoke\n\nGilderoy and Snape called the duels to a halt, desperately trying to halt the destruction before the entire class dissolved into utter chaos and spend the next few minutes trying to undo all the damage that the students had caused.\n\nJustin shot Allen another dirty look before snorting and turning sharply on his heel, striding over to his other Hufflepuff friends. Allen watched him go, slightly bemused at his behaviour but he shrugged it off and went to join Harry in wrestling what looked like a female troll off of Hermione who was trapped in a headlock.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The classroom door thudded shut behind Justin Finch-Fletchey and before he could figure out what had just happened, Ron grabbed Allen and Harry by their arms and dragged them out the doors too. The students parted before them, exchanging meaningful looks and whispers which followed them, growing louder as they neared the door. With a slam, silence all of a sudden fell around them. Allen opened his mouth to ask something but Ron shook his head firmly<p>\n\n\"Not now\" He muttered before continuing to drag the two boys all the way up to the common room with Hermione hurrying behind them, a confused look on her face.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry wondered down the corridor deep in thought- rather grateful for the snow day. He was too confused and muddled to think about class now. Self-doubt was beginning to nag at him. There was no way to be 100% sure that he wasn't related in some way to Slazar and if he was, did this ability to speak to snakes mean that he had somehow inherited the man's powers? and if so did that mean that... that he would become like him? Like that man who targeted the muggle-borns and despised anyone not 'pure'? Would he too become arrogant and blind to all others but himself? Was there anything he could do about it?<p>\n\nLost in his thoughts, he didn't even pay any attention to where he was going and somehow found himself somewhere around the North Tower part of the castle, lost in the labyrinth of corridors. He wondered around for a while aimlessly before deciding he really should get back to the common room. After a number of wrong turns Harry began to get very frustrated and was about to head into one of the classrooms to try and find a teacher to ask for directions when he saw Allen sitting on a window seat at the bottom of one of the corridors. Harry grinned in delight- he could ask Allen how to get back! He began to run down the corridor but caught himself when he saw who Allen was talking to\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"...I'm not going to tell you what to do OK Nicholas? I just felt I should let you know that if you ever regret your choice or wish to finally make that last journey, I could release you from your ties. Look, don't say anything now, just come and find me if you decide to. The offer will always be open to you and I'm not going to force you to do anything you're not completely sure about. Could you do me a favour though and tell the other ghosts about this? I feel like it is my function here on earth to ensure that no soul is ever trapped here against their will\" Allen gave a small smile at Nearly Headless Nick who was studying his hands intensely, avoiding all eye contact . He reached up his cursed arm and laid it gently on the ghosts shoulder<p>\n\n\"I will not think any less of you no matter what you choose. I think you are an incredibly brave person you know that? You made a tough choice and I have never heard you complain about it once. You shouldn't feel ashamed of the decision you made\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry watched in complete and utter confusion. Was he, could Allen really be... <em>touching<em> Nick? How on earth was he doing that?\n\nHis confusion only grew as he saw Nearly-Headless Nick begin to cry and saw Allen embrace the man- _ghost_- in his arms. From where Harry was sitting, it looked like Allen's left arm was actually touching the ghost. Nicks body had passed through the boy's right arm and shoulder but that left arm- was it possible, could it _really_ be touching him? **(1)**\n\nHarry repressed his impulse to move close enough to hear what was being said and slowly backed out of the corridor, remembering the decision he had made to trust Allen. Yet... he decided to talk to Ron and Hermione about this later. It made no sense. What could he have said that would have upset Nick so much and why had Harry seen a tear running down Allen's cheek too?\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The aftershocks of Justin and Nick's petrification were still reverberating around the school. Harry was beginning to feel incredibly sympathetic towards Allen now- how he had put up with the muttering and rumours and stares all year he couldn't even begin to understand. Although Harry was quite used to being ignored and disliked, he was not used to it being done by people whose opinions actually mattered to him. Hogwarts had been an escape from all the unpleasantness and prejudice he had faced through his life but now he was finding himself back on familiar ground and he was not enjoying the experience one bit. Even the Christmas holidays weren't enough to cheer him up- in fact he thought if it wasn't for the pollyjuice potion, he probably would be well down the path of depression by now. It was no fun to have people avoid you in corridors and sit as far away as possible from you in the classrooms and even the dinner hall. They even refused to make eye-contact with him and if not for Ron, Hermione and Allen, Harry thought he would quite possible have gone mad by now too.<p>\n\nAllen seemed to be struggling as well. People still hadn't crossed him off as a suspect, especially not after his argument with Justin in the duelling club. In fact there were even a few rumours going round that Allen and Harry were working together. Over the past few weeks, Allen had become withdrawn once again. It became normal to see him with dark smudges under his eyes and somehow he had defied all logic by eating even more than he normally did. The house-elves were now producing a good three or four times more food for his section of the table due to the inhumane amount he was now devouring. The boy did however seem to be cheering up now- he had never celebrated Christmas before and Harry secretly thought that the prospect of most of the student body leaving soon was also having a certain amount of influence on his good mood.\n\n_Still_ Harry thought- _it'll all be over soon, once the pollyjuice potion is ready, we will finally be able to get enough evidence against Malfoy and we'll be able to show everyone how wrong they were_. With this happy though, Harry perked up and made his way over to the library to try and prise both Hermione and Allen away from the books for long enough to get dinner together.\n\n**(1)- yeah, so, innocence can touch ghosts :P**\n\n**Apologies for the shortness of the sections and the chunks I missed out- I am just assuming you all know the story well enough to fill in the blanks :)**\n\n\n\t18. Chapter 18\n\n**I'm soooory! It's an entire day late... but guess what! I have excuses! This was exam week and yesterday was my friends 18th- I was planning on publishing it when I got back but we sort of ended up all getting into a huge debate at the restaurant so we didn't get back to 11. Yeah, me and my friends know how to par-tay! (For all you Americans out there, 18 is the legal drinking age, so generally people go a little insane...)**\n\n**Aaaaanyways, here's the chapter- though I realised as I wrote it, it is a little out of season... hope you enjoy anyway!**\n\n**777angeloflove- Here you go :P sorry about the delay though... *embarrassed face***\n\n**kirimoto- Yup, even ghosts need a little love! ^^**\n\n**sammi117- Tu-dah! Don't say I don't spoil you- though unfortunately, there are no maces in this chapter :L**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Ah don't worry about it :P Hope you enjoy this chapter!**\n\n**IncredibleIdiosyncrasies-...*glomp* thaaank you so much! Glad you've enjoyed it so far! I really hope you like this chapter too :) Though as I said unfortunately the mace doesn't make a reappearance in this chapter :'(**\n\nAllen woke up with a start, as a jolt of pain flashing through his head before disappearing again. He let out a low growl of irritation and flopped back on his pillows. This was beginning to get on his nerves- it was the fourth time he had been woken by his eye only to have it inform him that in fact he _wasn't _surrounded by half a million Akuma who were about to harvest the souls of his classmates. He maybe could have dealt with it but between that, his scouting sessions and his now almost nightly bad dreams he was lacking significantly in the sleep department and it was really starting to take its toll on him. Combine that with the added annoyance of having almost the entire school blame him for the attacks on two students, a ghost and a cat and you had a very good reason to be grumpy.\n\nHe let out another sigh and sat up on his bed peering out the window. The weak rays of sun were beginning to spill over the window sill, bathing a small strip of the dorm in pale golden light. Allen forced himself up- there was no point in trying to go back to sleep now considering he had to be up in a few hours anyway and there was no point in going out scouting again because he'd hardly be able to get out before he needed to turn back. He decided instead to work on his present for Mai. Christmas was only a few weeks away and seeing as he had never been able to celebrate it properly with Mai before, he was determined to make it the best Christmas ever.\n\nA few days ago, he had sent Timcampy out with an order for paints, wood and a few other things to be delivered to a PO box where he had stopped off to pick it up on his way back from one of his trips out of the school. He was combining a bit of magic and a bit of brute force to turn a few lumps of wood into a circus carousel. So far, he had assembled the basic structure and had managed to fix it so that the base spun smoothly on it cylindrical stand.\n\nHe settled down contentedly on the floor with the sun warming his back as he slowly painted alternating gold and scarlet spirals up the central cylinder. He had given up after a few disastrous attempts with a hammer and chisel at this stage and had resorted to wand-work to make accurate, evenly spaced grooves in the wood circling round and round the centre pole. He had also used it to create delicate swirls and spirals which hung down from the lip of the roof creating a little border.\n\nAllen let himself relax as he worked his way round the spiral, he wondered if his eye was picking up on his stress levels or if maybe it had some link to the attacks. He had begun he research again and was investigating different creatures that were in some way linked to spirits. This was getting him absolutely nowhere- the closest he had even come to something that would explain the reaction in his eye was a terrifying thing called a 'dementor' which was enough to freak him out significantly but even that was nothing even close to what an Akuma was so it couldn't explain his eyes reaction. He wondered if perhaps the creature was some form of 'evolved' Akuma. He had heard it mentioned a few times when he hacked into the Orders communications- about levels of Akuma. So far he had never met one above level one but he had heard that the higher up the levels you went, the more special skills the Akuma had. Perhaps the monster in the school was just some sort of evolved Akuma that could turn invisible or go through walls or something. If so though, it must've been in the castle for a long time as the previous attack had been a good fifty years ago but Allen figured it hadn't been too long after then that the Earl had gone 'underground' so to speak so perhaps the Akuma was becoming active now due to the Earl gaining power again.\n\nAllen cleaned off his paintbrush and began to paint alternating midnight blue, red and green stripes on the roof, arching them slightly so they were fat at the edge of the roof and grew smaller as they curved to meet at the apex.\n\nHe decided to bring his theory to Dumbledore once he had figured out the details. He didn't want to just approach the man with a wild idea- he would need to think about it further and finalise the details before proposing it to the headmaster. Besides, it was perfectly possible that there was no link between his headaches and the monster but it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen shook his head in mock disapproval as Fred and George both dived behind his chair, cowering in mock fear as soon as Harry entered the room.<p>\n\n\"Shhh, George!\" Fred stage whispered \"If you breathe too loudly, he'll hear you and set his army of miniature snakes with Severus Snape's hair on you\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" gasped George melodramatically \"Not the hair! Anything but the hair!\"\n\nThey both swooned in dramatic fashion, one hand resting on their foreheads as they crashed to the floor \"Grease...overload\" George gasped\n\n\"Can't... take... the slime any more\" Fred moaned\n\n\"Just kill us now and save us the pain\" They both yelled together\n\nHarry laughed at their antics and flopped down on the sofa opposite Allen\n\n\"You guys are mental you know that?\" he said, a wide grin spreading across his face\n\nFred poked his head up over the top of Allen's chair\n\n\"You won't be saying that when we are the only ones who survived the Snape-snake apocalypse now will you?\" He said cheerily\n\n\"Ooh, whatcha doing there Freak-features?\" George said, sticking his head up above Fred's, peering down at the wooden block Allen was holding in his hands\n\n\"Freak... features?\" Allen asked, his eye twitching slightly\n\n\"Uh-huh\" George said unconcernedly \"So, what ya making?\"\n\nAllen wavered for a second between sulking at the mean nickname and giving in to the twins contagious grins. The grins won out\n\n\"It's a unicorn for Mai's Christmas present\" He said, gesturing to the rest of the carousel that was resting on the ground in front of him\n\n\"HEY!\" He yelled as one of the twins scooped it up from the floor and ran to the other end of the dorm before stopping to investigate it\n\n\"What is a '_carousel_' anyway? It looks like a torture devise for unsuspecting creatures\" Whichever twin it was snorted, casually sending the toy soaring with a flick of his wrist towards his brother who caught it with equal nonchalance.\n\nAllen blanched and almost fell of his chair \"Be careful! That took me AGES to do! A carousel is like a big ride- little kids sit on the wooden animals and then the disk spins and music plays. It used to be Mai's favourite ride. When I worked at caravels or circuses, that was always where she played while I did my job so I made a model of it for her Christmas\"\n\nHe smiled at the memory before yelling \"OI!\" as Fred and George both exchanged looks and ran out of the common room up to their dorms yelling behind them as they went \"We'll get it back to you in a minute\"\n\nAllen chased after them and hammered on the door of their dorm \"Give it back you red-headed morons!\" he yelled\n\nThe door flew open, catching Allen by surprise and before he could gather his wits again, one of the twins grabbed the half- finished unicorn from his hand and said,face deadpan \"It's not nice to call people names you know Allen\" Before slamming the door shut again.\n\nAllen growled in irritation at the firmly shut door in front of him and childishly stuck his tongue out at it.\n\n\"Just get it back to me tomorrow so I can fix whatever damage you do to it and wrap it for Christmas\" He yelled at them before stalking back into the common room and flopping gracelessly onto the sofa again ignoring Harry and Ron who were both sniggering uncontrollably at his misfortune\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen narrowed his eyes at the carousel, closely scrutinising it. It didn't <em>look<em> much different. The twins had finished the unicorn and added it to the procession of magical creatures- a phoenix, a centaur, a hippogriff and a griffin. It looked... fine, more than fine in fact, because they had cast some sort of spell over it that caused the wood to give off a shimmery silver sheen just like the actual coat of a unicorn. He examined the toy closely from all angels before giving up with a resigned sigh and placing it inside its box, beginning to wrap the gift. If there were any unsuspected surprises hidden in the present, he would just have to wait for Christmas to find out. It was already 11 at night on Christmas Eve and he had no intention of being exhausted for the biggest day of the year. Besides, the twins wouldn't put anything dangerous inside the present would they?\n\nAllen carefully tied the bright red ribbon at the top of the box and sneaked it down to the infirmary to place it under the tree in Mai's room. He silently tip-toed over to the bed where she was sleeping soundly, she had obviously been trying to stay awake to see the presents arriving under the tree and had fallen asleep leaning against the side of her cot, her blankets clutched in her hand half-covering her body. Allen crouched down next to the cot and slowly eased her down onto her mattress and pulled her blankets up around her neck. He brushed her hair out of her face and leaned forward, gently kissed her forehead before sneaking out of the room again. If the twins had done anything to the present, he decided, it would be on their own head. He certainly wouldn't be stepping in to protect them from Mai's rage. He chuckled evilly as he remembered her confrontation with Malfoy. It was a shame he had banned her from using sharp weaponry but he was more than sure that Mai needed no such things to fully meet out her punishment on anyone that annoyed her. Yes, the twins most definitely would be sorry if they had messed with her gift.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry was in the middle of a very pleasant dream in which he had discovered a treacle tart tree in the Hogwarts ground. He had just picked the biggest one and was about to take a huge bite out of the steaming golden crust when he was rudely jerked back into reality by a sudden lack of oxygen in his lungs. The first thing he saw when he woke was a large pair of chocolate brown eyes peering at him. He scrambled around on his desk for his glasses and shoved them on his face to see Mai perched on top of his chest, bouncing up and down excitedly<p>\n\n\"C'mon sleepy-face! It's CHRISTMAS!\"\n\nHarry mumbled something unintelligibly as he tried to force his brain into gear. Ron, Allen and Hermione were all standing in the dorm looking equally sleepy and ruffled\n\n\"What time's it\" Harry groaned as he picked the squirming toddler up by the back of her sleep-suit and placed her firmly on the ground before rolling out of his bed\n\n\"It is quarter to seven\" Madame Pomfrey said crisply \"I apologise for taking her up here so early but she has been awake since half past five and I couldn't take any more of her whining\"\n\nMai latched herself onto Harry's leg, singing Christmas carols at the top of her lungs, using nonsense words every time she forgot the proper lyrics. Harry hobbled around the room resignedly to pick up his dressing gown and tied it tightly around his waist. \"Best get going then\" He said grimly before making his way towards the dorm door, dragging his weighed down leg behind him, his passenger giggling wildly at her new found way of transport. Harry let out a deep sigh. And _this _was exactly why he was never, ever going to have children.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Mai tore her way through the bundle of gifts that had appeared overnight under her tree, revealing enough sweets and toys to keep her amused for a very, very long time. She worked her way down through the pile to the second-last one which was crudely wrapped in brown wrapping paper \"That's from Hagrid\" Allen called out to her from the other side of the wrapping-paper mountain that had formed in the middle of the floor. Mai ignored him and tore into the present immediately- who cared who it was from? It was a present and that was all that mattered! She let out a squeal when she got through the paper, revealing a beautiful hand-made doll. It had silver hair that reached its shoulders and big blue buttons for eyes. The cloth body had clear stitches up its side but it was actually very skilfully made and not one piece of stuffing escaped from it as she crushed it to her chest laughing in delight<p>\n\n\"Look, Jibo! Its hair is just like yours! Isn't it pretty?\"\n\nAllen poked his head up over the mountain to see the doll \"It's lovely, Mai. You'll need to remember to say thank-you to Hagrid next time you see him\" But Mai had already stopped listening and was tugging the ribbon off the big box that Allen had made her wait till last to open.\n\nMai let out a cry of joy when she saw the beautifully crafted carousel and ran across the room to tackle hug Allen yelling thanks over and over again in both English and Japanese as her excitement took over her. She stretched up to her tip-toes and kissed her surrogate dad on his cheek before sprinting back over to the toy and excitedly pushing down on the point of the roof, causing the spring inside the centre cylinder to compress and the disk to start spinning.\n\nTo Allen's complete surprise and Mai's delight, as the disk started spinning, music began to spill out from the toy and little lights appeared across the carousel. She repeatedly pummelled the button on top, causing the disk to pick up speed. The music grew louder and the lights brighter. The animals on the carousel started to move and light up too, red light streaming from the phoenix, silver from the unicorn and so on. Their legs started to move as if they were running and for every press of the button, they ran faster and faster around the track.\n\nMai's eyes lit up with joy as she played with her new favourite toy. Allen glanced over the top of her head to see George and Fred both sitting behind her with huge grins on their faces. They gave him a sly wink and stood up to leave giving a casual wave of acknowledgement when he mouthed 'thank you' across the room to them.\n\nMaybe they weren't so bad after all. He twisted around to ask the other three what they thought of this turn of events but they weren't there any more. He shrugged to himself as he made his way over to join Mai with her toys- they must have gone down to make a start on their Christmas dinner. At the thought of food, his stomach immediately began to complain and he decided to join them as soon as possible. He loved holidays that gave reason for the kitchens to out-do even their usual huge spreads of food.\n\n\n\t19. Chapter 19\n\n**Sorry! I did it again! There was another surprise 18th... (excuses, excuses) sooooooory :P I'm just so popular... (lies) At _this_ 18th I played scrabble with a 8 year old while everyone else watched football and played chess (which I _still_ don't understand...)**\n\n**sammi117- Thank you! Unfortunately there is only a small appearance of Mai here... but it is rather cute :P**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- I know right! I love them to pieces too and I _did_ consider making them prank it in some way but I don't think they'd be mean to a little girl- I mean just look how protective they were of Ginny... plus they are smart enough to realise it's not a good idea to cross Mai. Especially not when she is armed with a mace.**\n\n**Kirimoto- I specialise in the adorkable ^^**\n\n**777angeloflove- Thanks so much :) Hope you enjoy this chapter too (even if it is late)**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeos- Perhaps ^^ we shall see- though if he does, it'll just be to see them, not to actually meet them. That doesn't fit in with my story quite yet :)**\n\n**Ms. Musiclover- Yea, I must admit I am a bit of a sucker for fluff too as you can probably tell!**\n\nHarry and Ron both sat slouched in their seats, gazing despondently into the fire as it burned down to its last embers. The day could not have gone any worse- not only was their only lead gone, Hermione was now stuck in the Hospital wing for goodness-knows how long as Madame Pomfrey tried to come up with a cure for being a cat. With Hermione not around, the likelihood of them ever solving this mystery was significantly reduced and to top it all off, Madame Pomfrey had looked incredibly incredulous at the story they had cooked up about a potions experiment going wrong.\n\nThe two boys were jolted from their revivers by the noise of the portrait hole opening. Allen strode in and glared so furiously in Harry's direction, he actually checked to see if there was some monster standing behind him before realising that the glare was in fact directed at him\n\n\"Which of you is going to explain to me exactly why Hermione is stuck in the Hospital wing covered in fur?\" the boy hissed, looking pointedly from Harry to Ron\n\n\"Well, we were practicing potions for Snape...\" Ron began, trailing off as Allen turned his burning gaze in his direction\n\n\"The _truth_ please, I'm not stupid you know and I saw you take a potions book out of the restricted section so I know whatever it is you were up to, it had nothing to do with class.\"\n\nHarry flushed as Allen turned his attention back to him, his gut twisted uncomfortably as his defensive side rose up- it hadn't been _his _fault\n\n\"What?\" he yelled back, surprised at the forcefulness of his own voice \"You been spying on us? Well we're not telling you anything till you tell us where you've been sneaking out to every night. For all we know _you_ could be the one controlling this monster!\"\n\nHarry regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth but his pride wouldn't allow him to take them back. There was a defining silence. Allen stood, frozen, a look of intense hurt on his face. He opened his mouth as if to say something but closed it again, turned on his heel and left without another word.\n\nHarry slumped back down in his seat, his heart thumping loudly, breathing heavily. He glanced over at Ron and caught the boy's reproachful look\n\n\"It _wasn't _my fault\" he insisted, ignoring the whiny note in his voice and he returned his gaze pointedly to the fire which was now almost burnt out, the cherry red embers fading into grey ashes. He continued to watch it till it burnt out completely, pretending not to notice when Ron silently stood up and left for the dorms without another word\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen sat cross-legged in the middle of the nursery, one arm around Mai who was snuggled up in the crook of his arm, half-asleep. In his other hand, he was awkwardly balancing a children's book he had found in the library against his knee as he read the story of 'Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump' for what felt like the fiftieth time. He had just reached the part where the evil muggle was threatening to expose Babbitty as a witch to the king when he noticed Ginny was standing in the doorway. He threw her a quick grin and gestured her over with the book, mouthing 'shh' as he inclined his head towards the dozing toddler. Ginny gave him a weak smile in return and sat down beside him, wearily resting her head on his shoulder- glancing up at him warily, as if to ask for permission. Allen smiled gently down at her and she closed her eyes relaxing against him as he continued to read the story.<p>\n\nAllen closed the book with a soft thud and gently placed it on the ground before him. Ginny stirred from her position with a reluctant moan and massaged her neck, watching with a rather amused expression as Allen slowly tried to shift Mai in his arms so that he could carry her to her cot without dropping her in the process. He stuck his tongue out at her triumphantly when he succeeded in shifting her without waking her up and he quickly made his way across the room and lowered her gingerly into the cot. He made his way back across to Ginny and offered her a hand up\n\n\"You alright?\" He whispered, peering at her face. She gave a rather forced smile and nodded her head firmly, refusing to meet his eye. Allen huffed and gently tugged her arm\n\n\"Let's go for a walk, ok?\" He took a hold of her wrist and led her out of the Hospital Wing before she had a chance to protest. Ginny followed Allen rather resignedly as he confindently navigated the corridors of the school\n\n\"I may have an absolutely terrible sense of direction, but there are three places that I know my way to off by heart. The Hospital Wing, the Great Hall and here\"\n\nThey rounded the final twist in a huge spiral staircase and emerged out into the owlry. Allen tugged Ginny over to one of the small balconies used for releasing owls and sat down on one of the marble benches\n\n\"I come out here a lot when I want to clear my head\" He said, glancing over at Ginny \"There's something on your mind isn't there?\"\n\nGinny ducked her head and studies her clasped hands with an urgent intensity. Allen lent back against the stone wall, surveying the night sky as he waited patiently. The silent stretched on for five, ten minutes, then\n\n\"What would you do if you had a really close friend but deep down inside, you didn't quite know if you could fully trust them and you thought that they might be mixed up in some bad stuff... and might be trying to involve you in it too...\"\n\n\"I guess\" Allen started hesitantly, disliking his answer before it even left his lips \"I guess I'd break off the friendship then, you've got to be able to trust your friends otherwise, it's not really a friendship\" That must be how Harry feels, he thought to himself. It's no wonder he accused me and didn't trust me- how can I expect him to believe in me when he has only known me a for a few months and in that time, I've never been completely honest with him. Allen frowned, even if he understood why Harry had acted the way he had, there was still a large part of him that was bitter and rather disappointed that Harry hadn't been able to figure out even from their short friendship that Allen would never even think about hurting anyone\n\nGinny stood up suddenly, startling Allen out of his reviver\n\n\"We'd better get back\" she said dully \"It's almost curfew time\"\n\nAllen nodded absentmindedly and led the way back to the dorms- too engrossed in his own thoughts to notice Ginny's forlorn expression.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Hermione scowled in irritation, they were at it again! These stupid boys couldn't even manage to cope with her absence for more than a couple days without having a falling out. Allen and Harry were both sitting at opposite sides of the table and were stubbornly refusing to speak to each other. From what she had managed to extract from Ron, she gathered that Harry was angry because Allen had blamed him for turning her temporarily into a cat and Allen was angry at Harry for accusing him of being the heir to the chamber of secrets. She couldn't believe Harry had gone down that track of thinking again- it was just so illogical but he just kept on coming back to his one line of argument '<em>remember, no one ever saw his sorting. In fact, I directly asked Nearly-Headless Nick and he<em> _told me that _Dumbledore _placed him in Gryffindor without consulting the hat. For all we know, he could really be a Slytherin!'_\n\nNo matter how many arguments Hermione placed in his way or how many times she pointed out that if _Dumbledore_ didn't know what house a student belonged in- who did? He still insisted that it was a possibility and then returned to what he viewed as the be-all and end-all of the argument '_besides, he still hasn't told us what he is getting up to at nights'_\n\nEventually Hermione had given up trying to convince him. He would see in time that he was wrong and when it came to that time, _man_ was she going to give him her best I-told-you-so look.\n\nAllen was being equally stubborn and was incredibly irritated that none of them would trust him enough to tell him what it was they had been doing that resulted in Hermione growing fur and a tail but was also adamant that he would not tell them where he went at night. All he would say on the subject, even when Hermione asked was that Dumbledore knew about it and that he had permission from the Headmaster.\n\nIt was just completely ridiculous but neither one would listen to reason. Hermione herself was just glad that there had been no more incidents for a good few weeks now and for a blessing like that; she could deal with being the awkward go-between till the two of them sorted themselves out. The entire school seemed to be taking a sigh of relief at the abate in petrifications- even Allen had begun to look a lot less tiered and strained. Hermione secretly thought that he had been affected more by the attacks than he had let on, as when they had been bad, he had often complained of sleeplessness and had been plagued by terrible headaches but now that the coast was seemingly clear he was looking significantly more healthy. Harry too had stopped hearing the strange voice around the school and though Hermione was rather sceptical about the link between the voice and the attacks, she couldn't help but feel that it was definitely a very good sign.\n\nTo top it all off, Valentine's Day was coming up and Professor Lockhart had been considerate enough to arrange a big celebration for it. It had been so kind of him to take on the responsibility even with all his teaching commitments- with all the stress and tension that had been building up, it was nice to have an excuse to celebrate. There were even rumours that he was going to arrange for cupids to go from class to class delivering Valentine cards- it was so generous of him. He had also been dropping some very subtle hints about the monster that made Hermione think perhaps he had beaten it and that was why the attacks had stopped. He was so modest that it was possible he had done it and just hadn;t told anyone. She hadn't mentioned this theory to Harry and Ron yet of course- they would just laugh at her. It was obvious they were very envious of Gilderoy, but it wasn't _his_ fault he had been blessed with brains _and_ looks. It must be so difficult for him to have so many people dislike him for his natural talent and yet he always just brushed it off, pretending not to notice the sneers and insults- in fact, she bet that was why most people thought he wasn't as clever as he really was, because he refused to rise to the bait when they made snide comments when in reality, he was just being the better man and taking the moral high ground...\n\n\"Hermione!\"\n\nHermione jumped, glancing up at Ron \"Huh! Erm, I mean what?\"\n\n\"C'mon, we have to get to class. You feeling ok? You looked pretty spaced out there?\" He peered curiously at her and she flushed bright red\n\n\"No! I'm fine, I was just thinking about my Transfiguration essay- I think I made a spelling mistake on the sixth paragraph...\" She peeked up at Ron and felt intense relief when she saw his glazed expression- thank goodness he hadn't noticed her lie \"Oh well, I'll change it later- let's go\" and with that she grabbed her bag and practically sprinted out of the hall before Ron could ask any more questions.\n\n**It's been a while since I've had anything to write down here...**\n\n**I have a new 2nd Harry Potter book now. So yea. That's... good. And annoying. In equal measure :P**\n\n**I never learn though coz I just lent the same friend 'Tales of Beedle the Bard' and 'Eragon' At least if I write that here then I have paper proof of me lending it!**\n\n**Thank you all for being such awesome reviewers as well... just a shoutout to all you lovely readers :P I probably wouldn't still be writing this if it wasn't for you!**\n\n\n\t20. Chapter 20\n\n**A/N- sorry its late again... I have no real excuse this time, we are enjoying a rare few days of sun here in Scotland so I have been spending as much time as physically possible working on my burn rather than the story... soooory! Still, this chapter _is _longer than the other one, so yeah, forgive me?**\n\n**sammi117- Yeah, Harry is somewhat of an idiot isn't he sigh :P Glad you enjoyed it!**\n\n**Kirimoto- Perhaps... I wasn't really thinking of it till I wrote that bit and now I am considering it... not yet anyway, but maybe in the future. They would be quite cute!**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- There is a Black Order mention here! But as for meeting them, not for a good bit yet I don't think... I will let you know though and try to involve them more in the story. Almost definitely no Cross though- I don't think I will have any of the generals in here though I'm not 100% decided yet**\n\n**777angeloflove- I figured that would be sort of how she was thinking considering she had such an obvious crush on him in the book and that was the only way I could explain the delusion. For being so smart, she is rather stupid :P**\n\nAllen strolled down the corridor, ignoring all the weird looks he was getting from the students. Mai was perched quite happily on his shoulders and was munching on a giant box of love-heart shaped chocolate which Allen suspected had been sent by Hagrid **(1)**- she also had a Valentine's card from a 'secret admirer' but Allen was almost 100% certain it was from the twins considering the song it played when you opened it went\n\n'_Your beauty is beyond compare_\n\n_You're eyes are sparkling stars_\n\n_The envy of girls every where_\n\n_It's a wonder, with a dad like yours!'_**(2)**\n\nThe tune was irritatingly cheery and repetitive plus unfortunately, Mai loved it and kept the card open so that the song played on an endless loop resulting in Allen developing a slight headache and many mental plans of exactly how he was going to torture the twins until they told him how to shut the stupid thing up. They had been visiting the kitchens as Allen had wanted to spend that special meal with Mai but hadn't wanted to be in the hall, what with all the animosity he was facing at the moment. As it had turned out, the elves had been thrilled with his seemingly endless appetite and had been more than happy to produce bucket after bucketful of food for him. They had been delighted with Mai as well having had no opportunity to meet her before. It turned out that elves had a bit of a knack when it came to small children and seemed to be less... nervous? with them. Their subservient attitude reduced around her as they went to any lengths to make her smile and laugh- performing tricks for her entertainment and whipping up these impossibly tasty, rainbow cupcakes.**(3)** Each cupcake had a layer of all the colours of the rainbow and was covered in white icing so you couldn't tell until you had bitten into them. Mai had been absolutely thrilled with it and the elves had more than happily made up half a dozen more and packed then neatly into a box for her to take back to the dorm. Although normally, Allen wouldn't have been so keen on allowing Mai to have that much sugar in her possession at any one time, he had let it slip when he saw the pure delight on her face and the resulting pleasure in the elves as they saw how well their gift had been received. Though he had already started working on a plan to distract her with a trip to Hagrid's so he could try and find a hiding place for them- the very thought of exactly how much disaster the little girl would reap after consuming that amount of sugar was frightening enough to make Allen risk her wrath after she found out her sweet treats had been confiscated.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Dumbledore gazed unseeingly over his steepled fingers at the spirals of steam rising up from his cup of Chai tea as he pondered over the theory that Allen had presented to him. It was an interesting idea and it definitely made things more than a little complicated. He was utterly convinced of course that Tom was behind the attacks- after all he had been to blame for the first ones despite the ministry's assumptions and he was far too prideful to even think of passing on the knowledge of the chamber of secrets to another. He would view it as an achievement he alone had managed to pull off- committing murder right under Dumbledore's own nose and getting off scot free. To allow another to use its power would not only mean putting trust in another human, which he had never been able to bring himself to do, it would also mean sharing the power which was not something Tom was particularly good at.<p>\n\nStill, this information shone a new light on the whole matter. That the boy's eye was bothering him was worrying, although it was perfectly possible that it was just reacting to all the ghosts and peeves. The young boy had been a true blessing in that area- a good number of ghosts had approached him having regretted or grown weary of their choice to remain chained to this world. He of course had been more than happy to oblige their wished and had freed them all from their bonds, allowing them to make that final journey. It was all of course being kept very hush-hush and all the Hogwarts ghosts were spreading the word with the utmost of discretion. It helped matters of course that the ministry tended to have as little interactions with the ghost community- and with any magical community other than the wizarding one of course- as possible which reduced the chances of them finding out about his skills and whisking him off to the department of mysteries for 'testing'.\n\nYes, it was definitely better that things were kept quiet, however Dumbledore was beginning to get rather concerned about the amount of stress this secret was putting on Allen. Already he had fought with Harry about it and it was detrimental to all Dumbledore's plans that those two boys got along. He decided that he would have to perhaps nudge them together gently. He knew that their temperaments and personalities complimented each other perfectly however Harry's inquisitive nature and rather hot-headed temperament was getting on the way of things. Perhaps desperate measures were called for...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen and Harry both scowled moodily as they made their way to Gilderoy's office. They had both been assigned detentions- Harry from McGonagall after she had heard about the incident with Malfoy and Allen from Herbology for knocking over a tray of sneezewart and holding up the class for a good 15 minutes while Professor Sprout tried to salvage the remains of the plant. Harry secretly suspected that they were both being asked to report to Lockhart because the teachers were looking for any excuse to get him out of the staff room- none of the staff seeming too keen to listen to his repetitive renditions of his many wonderful and courageous feats. Gilderoy of course was as oblivious as ever to this ill-will towards him and seemed to think that the teachers had handed the detentions over to him in the hopes that he would be able to mould these two young, impressionable boys into his image, though of course not quite as good for who could measure up to such an outstanding standard.<p>\n\n\"Well boy's\" he said, flashing that famous grin that had won so many awards \"Have we been badly behaved again?\" Harry and Allen swapped dark looks as they tried with extreme difficulty to refrain from rolling their eyes at his condescending tone and overbearing grin.\n\n\"I have a wonderful treat for you today! I know this was supposed to be a punishment, but I think that this method will be much more educational for the both of you\" Allen let out a small moan of despair and hung his head\n\n\" I know you must be excited but please try not to interrupt me... where was I? Oh yes, I have been asked to submit an auction piece for the SST- that is, the Squibs Support Team, get the poor unfortunates counselling, jobs in the muggle world and so on. I decided what better to submit than a hand-written book of mine! It'll get millions, however I have many demands on my time...\"\n\n\"I. Cannot_. Believe. _I am actually doing this\" Allen growled under his breath as he began to write out the opening chapter of '_Gadding with Ghouls', _trying to copy the sample of Gilderoy's handwriting that he had left them. The professor himself was sitting at the opposite end of the room quite oblivious to the death glares boring into the back of his head as he wrote replies to his most dedicated of fans\n\n\"Urgh, I know- can't believe McGonnagle would give me a detention for giving Malfoy a piece of his own medicine and then not even bother to take it herself\" He scowled angrily at the second chapter he was copying out \"Plus this purple ink is the most _vile_ shade in the world. Where does he even buy this stuff?\"\n\nAllen shook his head in disgust \"I don't know but if I ever find out, I think I will allow Mai to get her hands on a mace again and I will just point her in their direction...\" Harry gave Allen a rather confused look \"...a... _mace?\" _ Allen grinned and proceeded to tell Harry the whole story, dramatically re-enacting Malfoy's reaction after being clubbed on the leg by Mai\n\n\"What are you boy's up to?\" Professor Lockhart called over as Harry dissolved into gales of laughter\n\n\"Oh, I was just showing Harry exactly how you held the ghoul down while allowing its victim to escape sir\" Allen said innocently, his expression completely blank\n\n\"Erm, yeah, it was _really _amazing sir! You were so brave... still I think we had better get on with copying out your book\" Both boys waited for Gilderoy to turn back to his letters before exchanging sly looks and clapping their hands over their mouths to try and muffle their sniggers\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen didn't even return to the dorm that night. There was an uneasy feeling in his stomach that he couldn't shake. Something was wrong and his arm was itching to fight. He spun some story for Harry about seeing Madame Pomfrey about a migraine potion and headed out into the cool night air, broom slung carelessly over his shoulder. He was still wearing his school robes but he didn't want to risk changing and having Harry see him leave or attempt to follow especially not now that they were getting along again. They both had reached an unspoken agreement not to talk about 'that night' both realising that the other was not going to reveille their secrets but both also equally determined not to let it ruin their friendship- at least not yet. He scouted the skies for some time, Timcampy following him, resting every now and again on his shoulder, tracking all the reports coming in to the Order. The night was fairly quiet, although Allen did find two level ones, both thankfully quite far out from the towns and he dispatched of them easily enough.<p>\n\nThe sky was just beginning to lighten up again when he decided to turn back and return to the school. He, however, didn't get very far before his eye activated telling him that there were two more level ones a few miles out to the west. Without a second thought, he followed the signal and was just about to abandon his broom mid-air again when Timcampy bit down hard on his hood and yanked him backwards, almost making him fall off his broom. Allen twisted around to look at the golden golem \"_what?\" _he hissed. Tim opened his mouth in reply and projected a small map onto the sky before Allen, showing the area he was in and three black dots labelled 'black order'. Allen let out a sigh of relief- that had been a close one. He flew low landing the broom a fair bit away from the area, curiosity winning out. He tugged his school robes up over his head to hide his white hair and slowly made his way towards the village. Timcampy perched on his shoulder, hidden from sight by the folds of his robes.\n\nThe sounds of voices came floating on the wind and Allen picked up the pace, reaching a full out sprint as he neared the first line of houses. With a sudden burst of speed, he bounded up onto the low wall outside one of the houses and leapt lightly from the wall to the garden shed and from there to the house of the roof. From that vantage point, he watched the battle that was unfolding before him.\n\nOne of the Akuma was trapped in this strange rainbow, almost iridescent colour. The other was flying towards two men who were crouched on the ground holding the strange device from which the light was coming. Before it could reach them however, a young girl dropped out of the sky seemingly, with a cry. Allen's jaw dropped as he saw her, the light of the just-rising sun hit her as she fell toward the Akuma, one leg extended almost ballerina- like before her. The golden rays of the sun glinted off her dark green hair and reflected in her dark eyes. Allen had just enough time to note the blank, almost sad expression on her face before her leg descended with a resounding thud on the Akuma, driving it with extreme force towards the ground. Before it had even exploded, she flipped almost lazily in the air- completely defying every law of physics and shot off towards the trapped Akuma, breaking the barrier with ease and destroying it before it had a chance to retaliate. She landed elegantly on the ground before the two men who were holding the odd lantern-like box that had trapped the Akuma and began to talk to them- their voices too low for Allen to pick up. He watched them silently until they turned around and walked off towards one of the houses. He then slid down off the roof and returned to where he had left his broom, taking extra precautions and casting a disillusionment charm over himself and the broom before leaving. He wondered about the strange girl- she can't have been more than a few years older than him. Her sad expression lingered with him. She had looked almost dead behind those dark eyes- no spark of life or hope, just darkness. He wondered about her past as he sped through the skies towards the castle he now thought of as home and reflected on how lucky he was to have been saved from joining the order by Dumbledore. Although life at the castle was far from perfect, it was as close as he had ever come in his life and despite all its failings, he was happy and content there, he felt safe and protected- even cared for which was an odd feeling after all these years. If only there was some way to take the exorcists from the Order and put them under Dumbledore's control- although Allen knew it was impossible he wished for nothing more than to be able to make that sad girl smile again and see the joy of this world as well as the sorrow.\n\n**(1)- just pointing out for any of you who think this is weird- its not supposed to be! It's just I remember my granddad used to always buy me and my sisters valentine's cards when we were wee so I thought it'd be the sort of think Hagrid would do for Mai...**\n\n**(2)- I know I suck at rhyming and poetry and stuff... sorry :P**\n\n**(3)- These genuinely exist! It is pretty much my goal in life to find an excuse to make them- my little brother and sisters 11th is coming up soon, methinks this is a good excuse for rainbow cake!**\n\n\n\t21. Chapter 21\n\n… **yeah, about last week... erm... oops?**\n\n**Kirimoto- Well, if you invent some way to transport cake through the computer sure! If not, I shall just send you yummy yummy pictures of the delicious cake to torment you! :D**\n\n**sammi117- Thank you so much- and appologies again for the wait...**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- All shall be revealed ^^**\n\n**777angeloflove- I am not decided yet- I don't think so. At the moment, I'm thinking LenaleexLavi and AllenxGinny or Luna. Luna being my prefference by a hair. I'm going to re-iterate my warning though. There will be absolutely _no_ R-rated scenes in this. I think I'm going to stick to J.K's idea and just have hints and vague fluff. Nothing more. Remember, they are all still like 14/15. I want any relationship they _do_ form to be meaningful and I'm sorry to all who believe otherwise but at 15 you don't even know who you are so exactly how you find your love I don't know. Oooh that was a bit ranty wasn't it? Soz. Summary- there will be much plot and little romance :)**\n\n**Disclainer- This chapter has no Allen or Harry _or_ Mai in it whatsoever. It is entierly Black Order development... enjoy ^^**\n\nLenalee followed the two finders as they led her towards the area in the forest that had been causing the strange weather phenomena that had alerted them to the presence of innocence. She felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck and twisted around, scrutinising the grey stone buildings behind her but there was nothing there. She really needed to stop being so jumpy- it was unprofessional. Dismissing it from her mind, she turned back again to the forest in search of the fragment of innocence.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The rain streamed down in rivers from the formidable Black Order building which had oh-so-very conveniently been situated on the peak of a sea cliff. Lenalee picked her way warily across the rocks, now slick with rainwater gripping the silver case containing the innocence so tightly she could no longer even feel her fingers, which had turned pure white. Her pace picked up steadily as she got closer and closer to the building till she was half running towards safety. The doors opened before she even reached them and her brother stood, arms outstretched toward her, his white outfit standing stark and bright against the gloomy black building. Without even checking her pace, Lenalee flew strait into his arms, clinging to him as tightly as possible, her face buried in his jacket as she breathed in that familiar scent and let her body relax at last. It had been her first solo mission since she and her brother had been assigned to the Black Order and she had never been so long without him since... that time. Komui placed a kiss on the top of her head and gently unravelled her arms from around him, leading her by the hand back into the order to place the innocence in Hevlaska's presence.<p>\n\nLvellie had sent her and her brother to the UK reluctantly. He needed troops for the attack on the Earl however, there was something happening in this area that was bothering him- there had been a number of strange incidents and recently, Akuma had also begun to disappear with no trace. No innocence had been stolen thus far to their knowledge but Lvellie was not exactly ecstatic at the idea of an unknown presence-perhaps a rogue exorcist- running loose. It was he that should be ordering and controlling all the power of the innocence which was partially why he was so determined that he should be the first to get a hold of the heart if-no _when-_ it was found. After a great deal of consideration, he had come to a compromise. He decided to send the four youngest exorcists he owned out to investigate the situation. That way they would be kept out of the real battles until they were skilled enough to be of any use. They would also perhaps lure this mysterious soldier out and could even be used as bait for whatever the malevolent force was that was so shadowing the land, rearing its ugly head and retreating before it could be pinned down. If they could disturb it enough, it would likely strike at them allowing the more experienced and better soldiers to learn of its powers and attacks. Their sacrifice would pave the way to victory and- Lvellie hoped- somewhere along the way Komui would be gotten rid of too. Although the man was a great scientist and incredibly useful to the order, he was not as loyal as Lvellie would like. His infernal obsession with treating all humans as equals rather than recognising their separate roles on earth made him untrustworthy.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Lavi twisted and turned in the uncomfortable train seats, eventually settling with his head hanging over the lip of the seat and his legs hooked over the top of the back rest, holding him in place. The order had managed to commandeer an entire carriage for their use and he was determined to make full use of it- already having had several games of 'the floor is lava' before bookman had roundhouse- kicked him and forbad him from jumping around anymore. Tilting his head further back so he could see his grandfathers face, Lavi grinned winsomely at the old man who was scowling in irritation at his childish antics. Lavi couldn't help but chuckle- he looked so funny upside down. Bookman began to develop a tick as his grandson sniggered away from his ridiculous position<p>\n\n\"I hope this isn't going to be what you are like for the rest of this identity, young man. Remember, I am only allowing you to have this identity with your own personality because I am hoping that it means this one will last longer than the rest and once this battle is over you will have gotten your head strait again so you can truly fulfil your role as bookman and successfully hold deep cover for long periods of time\" He glowered at the boy who was still grinning, though not quite as brightly as before\n\n\"Don't worry about a thing pops, I have this all under control\" He winked, although the effect of this gesture was somewhat lessened by the eye-patch \"I am going to make the most of having my own identity though, it is gonna be fun to be able to truly act as I wish _oof\" _The breath rushed out of his lungs as his grandfather sucker-punched him in the stomach (again).\n\nBookman put his face right up next to Lavi's, his expression serious and his eyes flashing with contained anger \"Don't you even _dare_ let your emotions get away with you on this job young man. I am assuming that you are old and wise enough to be entrusted to hold your own identity without becoming... emotionally compromised. You let me down on this and all our training will have been for naught. I will have no option but to disown you. _Do you understand me?\"_ Lavi's expression became serious \"Of course Granddad. I won't let you down\"\n\nBookman settled back down on his seat and closed his eyes \"Good. Now shut up and let me rest\"\n\nLavi huffed and let his head flop back down, gazing at the ceiling. The old panda was over reacting as usual- there was no _chance_ that he was going to let his emotions get the better of him. Humans were monsters, they fought and killed and performed atrocities that were unthinkable. There was never any one side that was truly good or truly evil; in fact in most cases even the ideals being fought for were not truly good or evil. Men changed history to make it seems as if there had been one right side and one wrong side- brushing truths under the carpet when convenient to make it seem clear cut- that was where the bookmen came in. It was they that recorded all the murder and pillaging that followed the supposedly 'good' side and recorded all the grace and mercy found in the 'bad' side. They existed to remind the humans that there was no such thing as a truly good and a truly evil person. Those realms were reserved for God and the Devil alone and although some humans rose higher or sunk lower than most- they never attained that status. The bookmen proved that time and time again by exposing the hidden evil in the good soldier and the unexpected good that often occurred from the actions of an evil person. As if, after all the recording he had done, he could ever form an attachment to a human being- they were all self-centred and self-serving, capable of the most heinous of crimes when pushed. That didn't mean that he wasn't going to enjoy himself however, he had a whole vault of suppressed childishness after his many, many identities when he was younger that forbad him from acting out and he couldn't _wait_ to let it all out.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Kanda blocked out all outside information, concentrating solely on his breathing, relaxing each and every muscle with great difficulty. He slowly began to empty his mind of all thoughts and distractions one by one as he started his daily meditation exercise that had been prescribed by an Order shrink after he had had several violent outbreaks. In his defence, all the people he had attacked had most definitely been asking for it, however, the Order were under the strange impression that his tendency to solve all problems with Mugen was an issue and demanded that he find a way to control his temper. Hence the meditation.<p>\n\n_Clink, clink_\n\nHe took in another deep breath. Block out all the outside noises. Block them out. Ignore everything but your breaths he told himself firmly, breathe. In and out.\n\n_Clink, clink._\n\nHe bit his lip hard then immediately stopped- now he was all tensed up again! Repressing the curse that was on the tip of his tongue, he started again. Slowly, with each breath he began to release the tension again but that _noise! _It just wouldn't _shut up!_ He began to focus again, allowing his senses to take in and register outside influences. It was coming from his left, low down. It was repetitive. Sounded like glass. No, plastic beads. Clinking against each other in a rhythmic pattern. That new finder must be wearing a bracelet and be twisting it round and round their wrist. His hand clenched almost instinctively on the hilt of Mugen and he had lifted it a good few inches before he forced his hand down again. What was it he had been told repeatedly again? Something about there being no need for violence when words could solve the problem. All the finders were- with good reason- terrified of him. If he told the newbie to stop, she would. There was no need to resort to such- _clink. _He snapped. There was a sudden smash as Mugen sliced through the bracelet with such speed that the whole thing shot through the window of the carriage, smashing the glass and disappearing off into the landscape rushing past them. Kanda let a small smirk of satisfaction form before balancing Mugen once again on his knee completely ignoring the shocked expressions on all the finders' faces as he re-started his meditation. Where was he again? Oh yeah. Breathe in and out. In and out. Let the stress flow from your body and all anxieties leave you...\n\n\n\t22. Chapter 22\n\n**A/N I'm going to apologize again strait off (I have been doing an awful lot of apologizing lately :P) I know a lot of you really want there to be a BO/Allen face-off or meeting but I'm afraid to inform you that that (I love being able to use that that in a grammatically correct context :3) is not going to happen for quite some time yet, unless I decide to change the plot somewhat. Don't worry, it _will_ happen but it can't really yet. Dumbledore explains why. It wont be till at least after the ending of second year. Sorry about that :) Also I should add here, I am going away on holiday very soon and my summer is fairly packed so I may not always be able to get a hold of a laptop therefore my updates may be even more sporadic than they normally are :S forgive me?**\n\n**sammi117- Yeah, I quite liked it myself- that's just what I imagine goes on in Kanda's brain. I think the main reason he resorts to communicating in 'tch's' is because if he really said aloud what he thought, the order would appoint him a full-time therapist!**\n\n**777angeloflove- Don't worry, I'm sure Mai will protect him...**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- Thank you :) And yup, that scene is definitely going to be fun to write when I get round to it! I'm sure Mai will make quite an impression :P**\n\n**TheDeathAssistant4- Thank you so much! I know a lot of people really hate OC's but I felt I really needed her- I mean I couldn't have Cross Marion because I was going to make Dumbledore his mentor so I had to figure out another way to snap him out of the depression he got into after Mana's death and that was the best solution I could come up with. I mean, I think as soon as you start to write your own dialogue for a character, you are technically making them an OC anyway because you are putting your own twist on their personality so really I think that OC's are perfectly OK as long as the writer is able to make them realistic. I didn't really plan to put her in the story as much as I have but everyone seemed to really like her so she is playing a fairly big role. Yeah, I definitely plan on writing many more Allen and Mai scenes. They are so much fun to write :P**\n\n**Oh bye the bye, I think I accidentaly deleted one of my reviews but I never saw who it was from so sorry whoever it was- love you really! *Tacklehugs it all better* ^^**\n\n\"You did _what\" _Dumbledore said, standing up suddenly from his desk which was stacked high with papers and books all marked here and there with coloured pens and sticky notes in a chaotic order which only made sense to the headmaster. He manoeuvred his way round the teetering piles of documents with surprising ease and stood directly in front of the young boy\n\nAllen looked at the older man in confusion, unsure of what it was he had said that would cause such a dramatic reaction \"ah, I felt the presence of two Akuma so I went to check it out?\" He half asked, looking to his guardian for some clue as to what it was he was so concerned about\n\nDumbledore sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose \"You came into contact with the Black Order and came dangerously close to being caught. I think you are forgetting the terms of your contract, young man. I gave you very strict orders about the Black Order. You are to _stay away _from them. Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"But\" Allen started\n\n\"No!\" Dumbledore said firmly before Allen could finish his sentence. The young boy fell silent, slightly taken aback by the anger in Dumbledore's voice- he had never seen him so worked up before, used to him always being cool, calm and collected\n\n\"It is crucial that you understand this Allen- you are to have _no_ contact with the Black Order. None. That means no more blind scouting missions. I can't believe you would be so careless as to go on them in the first place, it leaves too much chance of being spotted by the enemy. I didn't think I would ever have remind you of exactly how dangerous it would be if the ministry became aware of the Black Order or vice versa. The resulting conflict would be disastrous for both the order and the magical community. I will remind you that I am putting my neck on the line for you here. Due to these attacks, the ministry is scrutinising me much more closely than before. I am taking a huge risk by allowing you to leave this castle at all and I would expect you to award my trust with mature and responsible behaviour. Do not let me down like this again\"\n\nAfter this, he turned on his heel and returned to his desk shuffling through some more papers and writing down a few notes on a piece of parchment. A few seconds later, he raised his head, noticing that Allen was still standing before him. He flicked his quill towards the door.\n\n\"You are dismissed\" He said shortly before returning to his paperwork.\n\nAllen turned to leave. It was odd- many people had insulted and hurt him throughout the years; said the cruellest things and attacked him in every way possible but never before in his life had he felt so... small and belittled. There were many good logical arguments that he could have made for his actions and for continuing to go on scouting missions; namely that they were the most effective way of tracking down Akuma as the only other way he could obtain information was through tapping into the Order's communications and they were not concerned with tracking Akuma, only innocence- and yet, every argument had melted away when Dumbledore had began his tirade and he had become so tongue twisted that he could not have formed a cohesive argument even if he had tried. Allen clenched his fist as he walked down the corridor to the Gryffindor common room. He hated being made to feel so foolish and weak when all he had been trying to do was save peoples souls. He had to restrain himself from slamming the dorm door in a fit of petty anger as he finally reached his dormitory and he flopped moodily onto his bed, crossing his legs beneath him and resting his head on his fists, glaring at the hangings in front of him, trying (and failing) to get a grip on the anger coursing through his veins. Suddenly, without any warning, white-hot pain shot through his eye. Allen clapped his hands to his curse mark and opened his mouth in a silent scream. He fell to the floor with a thud, clutching his face and doing his utmost to keep himself from crying out loud as the pain grew more and more intense. Just as suddenly as it came, it vanished, leaving him weak and panting on the floor- small whimpers escaping him as he tried to regain his breath. He felt something grip his arm and it took all his self-restraint not to yell aloud but when the pressure rolled him onto his back, he saw not some terribly powerful monster about to devour him but rather Harry, his face concerned as he looked down at the trembling boy\n\n\"What happened to you mate?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"I still don't understand why won't you go and tell Dumbledore about his? The way I see it, your scar must be a bit like mine. When I get close to Voldemort- stop <em>whimpering<em> Ron- it really, really hurts. Yours must have sensed the monster from the memory Riddle showed me and reacted to it. I don't suppose the monster could in any way be connected to your dad's death? That would certainly explain a lot\"\n\nAllen was sat in the middle of the huge ornate rug in the common room in front of the fire, still shivering almost uncontrollably, a rug wrapped tight around his shoulders. Harry and Ron both sat in front of him, watching the young boy intently. At the mention of his adoptive father, Allen ducked his head his eyes becoming sorrowful as he studied the pattern on the rug with a sudden intense interest\n\n\"I guess there may be a connection, though it would be really weird- I though the Earl controlled them all\" He muttered under his breath, tugging at the threads of the rug. He raised his head to see Harry and Ron's confused and concerned expressions\n\n\"There's no point in telling Dumbledore anything right now\" He said more clearly\n\n\"Not until we know for sure what is going on. We need to talk to Hagrid- ask him exactly what happened. I don't care what Riddle said, there is no _way_ that Hagrid would be naive enough to keep a pet that killed people\" Harry and Ron exchanged incredulous looks\n\n\"Have you ever heard about a creature called Norbert\" Ron began...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>It was just before the Quidditch match when Harry suddenly let out a yell, making Ron and Hermione jump with fright \"The voice!\" He cried \"I just heard it again- didn't you?\" Hermione took off at a sprint towards the library calling behind her to them that she had just figured something out. Allen looked back after her as she rocketed past him on the stairs.<p>\n\n\"Where is she off to in such a hurry?\" He asked as he joined Harry and Ron, Mai perched cheerily on his shoulders\n\n\"I'm not sure\" Harry said, nervously eying Mai whose face had lit up as soon as she saw him\n\n\"I wanna ride on Harry's shoulders!\" She cried, leaning over her papa's head so she was looking him eye to eye \"Pleeeeeeeeeeease Jibo?\"\n\nTen minutes of puppy eyes, tantrums and begging later, a rather subdued Harry trudged his way to the Quidditch pitch with a delighted Mai bouncing up and down on his shoulders, giggling wildly. Allen and Ron followed behind him sniggering at their friend's misfortune however; when they arrived at the Quidditch pitch the atmosphere was tense and sombre. Professor McGonagall marched up to them, her face serious\n\n\"I have bad news for you all...\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>Insert here trip to Hagrid's, the visit of the Minister and Lucius Malfoy plus the clue about the spiders<em>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The three boys stood outside the dark forest, watching rather despondently as the spiders all marched in an absolutely uniformed line through the trees into the impenetrable darkness within.<p>\n\n\"You know, I think Allen was right... there's no way Hagrid had anything to do with this\" Ron piped up, rather hopefully, his voice a good few octaves higher than normal\n\n\"We can't be sure until we go in. If we are right then Allen's scar will hurt when we get close to the creature and that is how we will be able to tell\" Harry said, trying his utmost not to let his fear show\n\n\"Come on\" Allen said grimly, starting off into the trees \"We are wasting precious time. Remember- Hermione and all the other victims are counting on us to solve this. With Dumbledore gone, we are the only ones that can make any difference\" He turned on his heel and marched determinedly into the forest without so much as a pause or a backward glance. Harry followed his friend, his face serious- when Dumbledore had been removed from the school, some ministry officials had turned up and Allen had been taken out of class. He hadn't returned all day and after a lot of searching, the two boys had found him in Mai's nursery. Sitting silently on the floor and staring at her empty cot with blank eyes. Turned out that as Dumbledore was her legal guardian and was no longer at the school, the ministry had the power to remove her. They obviously had wanted to avoid a scene and had taken her away to an orphanage somewhere before taking Allen out of his class to tell him. He hadn't even got the chance to say goodbye to her, in fact he wasn't allowed to visit her at all and they refused to tell him where they were keeping her or to allow him to contact her in any way. According to them, he had no rights over her as- technically- they were not related. From that day on, he had been like a ghost- hardly speaking and he had even begun eating less. The first signs of life had re-ignited the second he had seen the spiders and Harry was sure he was going to stop at nothing to return things to the way they had been.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>There was complete silence between the group of boys as the picked their way gingerly through bushes and briars, keeping their wandlight trained on the procession of spiders as they made their way deeper and deeper into the forest with Fang padding obediently behind them. The trees grew more and more dense as they proceeded until they were hard pressed to make their way through the trunks and bushed that were traversed so easily by the trail of spiders and soon the only light they had to guide them came from their wands- all moonlight blocked by the thick foliage above them. Harry cleared his throat nervously \"Remember, we only need to get close enough for Allen to get a good look at the monster so we can see if his scar...\" They all jumped in fear as Fang suddenly started to bark wildly at something in the darkness, beyond the wandlight. Ron clutched Harry's arm in a vice like grip and let out a whimper of fear. Allen however, moved in front of the two boys, raising his arms into a fighting position, his face set and determined as he glared into the darkness. A beam of light suddenly burst across the small group and Allen had his wand out and a spell half formed on his lips before Ron caught his arm and cried \"It's my car! It's OK\" Harry let out a laugh of relief as he walked up to the car, petting the bonnet. The car lent toward him as if it enjoyed the contact. He turned to Ron to laugh at the bizarre incident but the expression his friends face was not one of relief but of fear. Allen and Harry both turned to follow the boy's terrified gaze and the blood drained from their faces as they saw exactly what was terrifying him so much<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry desperately tried to keep the giant spider in conversation as he furiously calculated exactly how they were going to get out of this horrible situation alive. He glanced at Allen out of the corner of his eye but the young boy shook his head minutely; this creature- terrifying though it may be- was not the monster they were looking for. Aragog dismissed them and all the surrounding crowds of spiders began to press in on them. The three boys stood back to back as the oppressive wave grew closer and closer to them. Harry wracked his brain for some sort of spell that could take on such a large number of opponents. He had just come to the conclusion that he was just going to have to stun as many of them as possible when two things happened in very quick succession. A huge tongue of flame shot out on his left, from Allen's wand lighting the whole hollow and sending all the spiders on that side screeching for cover. At the same time, the car burst out from the forest, skidding to a halt beside them. Its doors swung open and Harry grabbed Ron and Allen's arms yanking them with him and bundling both of them into the car. He then dived into the back seat and called Fang in before slamming the door shut just as Ron slammed his foot on the accelerator causing them to leap off into the trees away from the spider's hollow. Ron's face was a mask of terror as they sped away from the scene, his mouth was gaping open but not a sound came out of it. Harry and Allen exchanged rather concerned looks but a sudden slam immediately diverted their attention. A large spider dropped onto the back windshield and thumped down on the glass with his pincers \"Ron, keep well away from trees on my side please\" Allen yelled. Without a seconds hesitation, he then proceeded to wind down the window and lean out of it, his body half out of the car- on foot rested on the edge of the window and the other on the seat. He clung tightly to the headrest of his seat with one hand and clutched his wand in his other hand which he brought out of the car, shooting a stupefying spell at the creature before it could do any more damage. The red light hit the spider and it catapulted off the car, disappearing into the darkness. He then fell back into the car, panting heavily, his chest heaving up and down. Harry lent forward between the seats and silently offered his hand to his friend. Allen smiled grimly and clasped his friend's hand, accepting the help back upright. The car forcibly ejected all its passengers as soon as they entered the school grounds once again and sped off back into the darkness. Allen was bent over double trying to regain his breath<p>\n\n\"So we are back to square one again\" He growled furiously, punching the ground\n\n\"It was a dead end. Again! I can't afford this, I can't afford to waste any more time. I...\" He trailed off, ducking his head, his shoulders heaving whether with tears or exhaustion Harry didn't know. Surprisingly, Ron- despite his shaking body and blanched face- was the one to offer comfort. He placed on hand on Allen's shoulder as he knelt down on the grass beside him\n\n\"It wasn't a complete dead end, Allen. We now know that Hagrid was innocent. That puts a whole new perspective on this whole thing. Just you wait, we will solve this thing and before you know it, Dumbledore will be back being his usual enigmatic, mental self and Mai will be back traumatising Harry and running mad round this school just like before\"\n\nAllen raised his head, giving a half hearted smile to his two friends. He nodded silently, not trusting himself to speak and the three boys made their way together back to the castle, all thanking fates and fortunes that they all their limbs were still intact and attached after their insane adventure.\n\n_**This chapter brought to you by Necron_warrior, Because Mustangforfuhrer is a silly person who forgot to post her lastest chapter, but uploaded it :P**_\n\n\n\t23. Chapter 23\n\n… **So. Hey. Remember those times I apologised when I was one day late in posting this story? Heh, yeah. Not really sure what to do now that I'm, like, 5 weeks late. Grovel? *mustangforfuhrer grovels* SORRY! Would you believe me if I told you I have only been at home for roughly 5 days in those 5 weeks and 3 of those days were pretty much spent either unpacking, repacking or recovering? These holidays have been hectic- in a good way- I pretty much visited the entire UK which was great fun however, my family have a habit of hollidaying strictly in places with no internet connection whatsoever. Plus when you get out of the habit of writing, it is pretty hard to get back into the habit again. Enough excuses. I'm very sorry, here is the next chapter! (After my responses to the reviews- cheers for them btw everyone!)**\n\n**777angeloflove- You shall soon find out! We are so close to the BIG chapter. So excited! Hope it meets up to your expectations. You are more than welcome to crisp me with a flamethrower if it doesn't :P**\n\n**sammi117- I know right? I was pretty much in tears as I wrote that part. Love Mai and Allen together so much. I must be a pretty mean writer to torture my characters so :'( Still, I shall make the reunion fantastic to make up for it :D**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- I shall take that as a compliment? Like you how? As in I am a mean, mean writer who tortures her poor helpless characters and readers alike?**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Sorry about loosing your review :( Hope you like this chapter too and thanks so much for all the lovely things you always say *tacklehugs***\n\n**lynnhunt12- Yeah I have been trying to figure out a way to put in his gambling side without it being too forced... It will come up at some point I promise**\n\n**kirimoto- Heh, although I wouldn't put it past them to set the whole of the forbidden forest on fire, no they did not. Much to Hagrids relief. Where would he hide all his 'misunderstood' creatures if that place was gone**\n\n**PurpleKyuubi- Yeah, apologies for the huge wait. Hope you like this chapter too :)**\n\nAllen sat cross-legged in the middle of the deserted nursery. He was scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment, his ink bottle lying half-empty by his side and a veritable mountain of discarded, crumpled paper surrounding him. He wearily ran his hands over his face unintentionally smearing ink all down his cheek. He had sat down two hours earlier with the idea of getting all his theories down on paper. The plan had been to make things clearer but all he had succeeded in wasting a lot of time and confusing himself even more. He knew the creature was an Akuma but tracking it down was proving to be much more difficult than he thought. His eye had been bugging him much more than usual, keeping him up at night- not allowing him a moments rest apart from the few naps he had managed to take in class, quickly making him significantly less popular with the teachers. Each time it acted up, he got up and tried to figure out where the signal was coming from but had yet to figure anything out for sure. The best explanation he had come up with so far was that this Akuma was possibly the elusive 'level 2' that he often heard the Black Order go on about. Perhaps it was somehow shielding itself from him- that would explain why the signals never intensified when an attack was happening though it didn't really explain why the signals had grown stronger at all, unless the attacks were somehow making the creature more powerful and therefore making it more difficult for it to disguise its presence. Either way, his cursed eye was proving to be pretty useless this time. The best plan of action then was to try and track it down from its attacks however that seemed to be a dead end too- they all were seemingly random. It was however interesting to note that the last time the creature had shown up, one of the students had died and so far this year, there had only been petrifications. Allen's hand froze just a few centimetres above the page as he stared blankly at the wall- he felt as if he was teetering on the edge of a breakthrough but that final connection was slipping elusively through his fingers. **(1)**5O years ago... someone had died. A student. A young girl. There was a sudden crash as the Nursery door flew open and Harry and Ron came hurtling through\n\n\"Allen! That girl that died 50 years ago! You don't think...\" Harry gasped breathlessly\n\n\"Moaning Myrtle\" Allen completed his eyes wide, a huge grin spreading over his face.\n\n\"C'mon! We gotta go\" He cried leaping to his feet and running to the door, grabbing Harry and Ron by the wrists spinning them around\n\n\"Let's go catch ourselves a monster!\"\n\nHarry and Ron exchanged longsuffering looks before following their friend back out into the corridor where they had abandoned a bemused Gilderoy Lockhart when the idea struck them.**(2)**\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>Insert McGonagall run-in here<em>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen thanked his lucky stars that Madame Pomfrey was good at keeping her secrets, merely raising an eyebrow at them as Professor McGonagall returned them to the hospital wing mere minutes after they had left. Allen's head was buzzing with this new crucial piece of information as he started trying to piece everything together. This creature was capable of killing- and had done so before but must have done so in a way in which he could not be identified, otherwise this mystery would have been solved long ago when Myrtle's ghost was questioned. The only question that remained to be answered was how then. How did it kill and why did it sometimes fail to kill- what was the link between all the victims that had prevented their attack from being fatal. He stared intently at Hermione's frozen features as the three boys crowded around her bed trying to somehow divine from her what it was that she had seen. She had been so close to discovering... then it hit him, the shock of the breakthrough was so powerful that he physically took a step back, taking a sharp gasp of air. Ron and Harry both looked quizzically at Allen who was gazing wide-eyed into space, a look of utter shock on his face.<p>\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Harry ventured nervously as his friends dazed expression intensified\n\n\"I can't believe I have been so stupid\" Allen murmured, still staring into space\n\n\"_What?\"_ Harry and Ron chorused together\n\n\"Harry, every time there is an attack, you hear something no one else can, right?\" Allen said, snapping out of his daze\n\n\"Yeah\" Harry confirmed, still not quite catching on \"But what does that...\" He trailed off, his eyes widening \"Oooooh\"\n\nAllen leaned forward and gently worked a scrap of paper out of Hermione's clenched fist\n\n\"I've read about this creature myself before\" He said eagerly as he showed it to the two boys \"When I was researching magical creatures- I got distracted and went down the wrong lane but Hermione must have stuck with it and found the answer and look- she figured out how it's been getting round too!\"\n\nHe sighed at the bemused expressions on both his friends faces\n\n\"Come on! Keep up! He tapped his finger on Hermione's note. We need to head down to the girls bathroom and have a conversation with Myrtle\" He leapt to his feet but before he could run for it, Ron grabbed his arm\n\n\"Woah there mate, what exactly is your genius plan? We go and take down a deadly, murdering monster on our own? Not a chance. We are going to the teachers to tell them. YOU may wish to confront a murdering snake on your own but I'd rather not die today thanks very much\"\n\nAllen rolled his eyes \"Fine- lets go\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>insert the Ginny revelation here<em>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>There was utter silence in the Gryffindor common room- or to be more accurate, there was a copious amount of noise but the five boys sitting in the middle of the floor looking utterly shell shocked could hear none of it. Their classmates rushed in and out of their rooms, sending owls, packing and moving purely for the sake of having some excuse not to sit down with the silent boys. It was Ron who finally broke the silence after the twins had left, muttering something about a walk<p>\n\n\"We need to go see Lockhart. Tell him\"\n\nHarry and Allen both nodded silently, and the three of them strode out of the common room oblivious to the looks of pity and worry that the other students shot their way. Moving seemed to jolt Allen's brain back into action and the fog that had descended on him when he heard of Ginny's disappearance cleared slightly, allowing him to start processing this new piece of information. It made no sense- why capture but not kill? And why Ginny? She must have known something, something that frightened the monster's master enough to provoke him to kidnapping her. Perhaps she knew his true identity. All of a sudden, the very air inside his lungs seemed to freeze. She had tried to tell him- that day, in the owlry. He had been so wrapped up in his own petty problems that he hadn't even recognised the plea for help. He had ignored her at her time of need and now, it was more than likely that she was dead as a result of his selfishness. He raised his eyes to look at Ron's haggard face, half fearing that he would be able to read the guilt he was certain was written all over his features. Ron however just gave a small smile, his eyes as trusting as ever before turning back to their whimpering coward of a teacher. Allen squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath steeling himself for what was coming. It would be selfish and redundant to tell Ron about his failure now, it would accomplish nothing and only cause more anguish. For now, all that there was to do was to track down this foul creature and destroy both it and its master. If by some miracle he survived that, he would then offer his own life as compensation to Ron and his family. Although he was more than aware that this would in no way heal the hurt they had suffered, nor bring their daughter back but at least they would have comfort in the knowledge that their daughters murderers were no longer breathing. He offered up a silent apology to Mai, pain twisting in his gut like a knife at the thought of her once again alone in the world but at least he had the knowledge that Dumbledore would look after her once he was gone. She deserved better than a murdering scumbag for a father and how could he look her in the eye each morning with the knowledge that his selfishness had cost the life of his friend's sister. He set his jaw firmly, a dangerous gleam coming into his eye. He would stop at nothing to find her body. The least he could do was offer her family the chance to give their one and only daughter a decent burial.\n\n**(1)- Just to make it clear, they didn't make this discovery till now because the outcome of the forest was slightly different due to Allen's presence. Plus I forgot. But mostly because of Allen's presense**\n\n**(2)- And HERE it ties in with the time they convinced Lockhart that he didn't need to shuttle them around from class to class. With me? Wouldn't blame you if you weren't**\n\n\n\t24. Chapter 24\n\n**A/N OK, I think I owe you guys an explanation- I had half though of posting it with the last chap but I forgot. A lot of you have been commenting about Allen's- lets be honest- slightly melodromatic guilt trip. I admit I maybe went a bit (just a teeny weeny bit) over the top with that but I do have a little bit of a defence (here I go again with coming up with bad excuses for my writing!) Allen has been living on the streets his whole life, and there you can loose your life if you so much as say something wrong about or look funny at someone, it is therefore likely that he is almost a complete stranger to the idea of forgiveness. I do acknowledge though I did layer it on too thick. I'm not changing it thoug, I'll just learn from my mistakes**\n\n**sammi117- Cheers :D Hope you enjoy this one too. **\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Thanks so much ^^ **\n\n**coronadomontes-****Gracias por su apoyo. Espero que disfruten este capítulo demasiado. Rogamos disculpen a los españoles muy pobres**** XD**\n\n**Oh, Sidenote before you get too excited. This is NOT the battle scene. I know, I am a very cruel author but I have a feeling the battle will take some time to write so here is a taster**\n\nAllen studied the young ghost in front of him, frowning slightly as he mentally went through the list of the ghost he had spoken to about helping them pass on. He couldn't remember ever seeing her or speaking to her before. She seemed to almost relish relating her death to the three youngsters, her eyes lighting up and her voice becoming animated as she related to them her hair-raising encounter with the Slytherin monster. She had probably, he thought, led a horribly dull life and her death had been the first exciting thing to ever happen to her. No wonder she clung to it so tightly, it was the one thing she could boast of and it had come to define who she was. It was rather ironic, that the thing which defied her existence was her death but who was he to judge? If she was contented to exist in this state he certainly was not going to be the one to challenge that. The trio of boys approached the freakish set of sinks in the centre of the bathroom, all wands trained on the whimpering professor. Harry broke off from the group and crouched down in front of the snake shaped tap handles staring intently into their blank stone eyes. Allen kept his wand on the professor who looked like he was either going to puke or faint at any moment and yet, there was something in his shifty eyes that was making Allen nervous. He knew fine well that Lockhart had done none of the daring deeds he had laid claim to but that was not to say that he wasn't dangerous. A low rumble filled the air, echoing round the bathroom as the sink sunk down into the ground, revealing a gaping black hole. The three boys exchanged glances and came to a silent, unanimous decision. As one, they raised their wands to Lockhart's head and forced him down the tunnel first before following him. Allen landed nimbly on the balls of his feet beside the tangled bodies of the others at the foot of the pipe\n\n\"I think we are under the lake\" Ron said, his face pale but grim as he stood up and brushed himself off\n\n\"We had better get moving\" Harry said, lighting his wand. Allen and Ron followed suit and soon they were making their way cautiously through the dark tunnel, with Gilderoy in the middle of the group wringing his hands and sweating bucket loads. They rounded a corner and came across the monstrous skin of the snake. Allen's mouth went dry at the sight of it. How on earth were three teenagers and a pitiful excuse for a teacher going to take on such a creature? At least, he thought grimly, that cleared up one mystery. It was without a doubt the master, not the creature that had been activating his eye. That meant... but before he could follow this information to its logical conclusion, Lockhart lunged for Ron's wand and shot of a spell, hitting himself and shaking the passage to its very foundations. Allen reacted almost instinctively, diving sideways and tackling the nearest person to him to the ground out of the reach of the barrage of masonry brought down by the rebounded spell. Unfortunately although he managed to knock Harry out of the way, he didn't quite manage to escape the rock fall and he let out a scream as red hot pain shot through his shoulder. Harry rolled over, coughing as the dust coated his lungs making them burn. He staggered to his feet and half-fell over to where Allen lay face-down on the ground. Harry dropped to the ground next to his friend. A rock lay a few feet away from him, having thankfully just glanced off his right **(1)**shoulder. Allen raised himself up shakily on his good arm choking and coughing on the thick air, his body shuddering as it struggled to support his weight. Harry grabbed him under his good arm and sat his up against the stone wall of the cave\n\n\"Are you alright\" He yelled, hardly able to hear his own voice through the ringing in his ears. Allen nodded \"I'm fine. Fine. Ron!\" He cried twisting round to look at the solid wall of rock that now separated them from their friend. Harry made his way over and tried to breakthrough while Allen closed his eyes, gripping his shoulder with his hand, taking deep breaths as he steeled himself for pushing it back into joint. He silently counted down from three in his head and with a sudden jerk, forced the joint back into its socket. He let out another yell of pain as his shoulder protested loudly but once the initial shock died off, it settled down to a dull ache. He opened his eyes again and saw Harry's shocked face\n\n\"Did you... what...\" He stuttered eyes wide\n\n\"It doesn't matter now. I'm fine. Is Ron OK?\" Allen said, narrowing his eyes slightly when it looked like Harry would protest\n\n\"He's stuck\" Harry replied, after recovering from his shock\n\n\"Come on then\" Allen said, standing up, ignoring the red spots that danced mockingly before his eyes \"We have a monster to defeat\"\n\n\"Are you sure you should be...\" He trailed off as Allen fixed another determinedly stubborn glare on him and he raised his hands in surrender\n\n\"On your own head be it. Let's go catch ourselves a snake\"\n\nThe two boys grinned at each other then proceeded down the foreboding passageway, side by side.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>They walked in silence, the echoing sounds of their footsteps filling up the tunnel making them both wince at the noise they were making. Harry shot Allen a surreptitious look as they made their way down the twisting passage. He looked even paler than normal but other than a slightly firmer set to his jaw than normal he didn't look at all like he had just dislocated his shoulder and re-set it himself. Allen turned to look at Harry and he wasn't quick enough to turn away before he was caught<p>\n\n\"Isn't it sore\" He said after Allen raised a questioning brow\n\nAllen shrugged his good shoulder \"Yeah, a bit. I would put a healing spell on it but that would drain my energy as my body would be forced to repear**(sp?)(2)** the damage very quickly. I _could_ put a pain deadening spell on it too but I have a feeling I'm going to need to be on full alert for what's coming up. Besides, a little pain will do me no harm. Goodness knows I deserve it\" His voice trailed off at the last part and Harry tilted his head slightly to one side, confused\n\n\"What?\" He questioned\n\nAllen let out a small sigh and ducked his head \"I guess I may as well tell you now. You'll find out anyway. Ginny came to me. A good few weeks ago. She tried to tell me about all this\" He waved a hand vaguely in the air \"I was so self-involved I didn't even notice. Now she is probably dead and its all my fault\" His voice fell to a half whisper as he finished. He bit his lip hard trying to hold back the tears that were dangerously close to spilling over. He didn't deserve to cry- how many deaths did he have to cause before he realised he was too dangerous to be allowed around people. First Mana, now Ginny. He was concentrating on holding back his tears so hard he almost missed Harry's question\n\n\"What do you mean 'all this'?\" He asked curiously\n\n\"Well, she came to me and asked about what you do if you suspect a friend of yours is doing something dangerous. I gather therefore that as she is the only student so far to be kidnapped, not outright killed that this means she had a direct and personal contact with the master of the monster. It couldn't be the monster itself as she can't speak parsletongue. Perhaps they corresponded by letter...\" He trailed off looking perplexed\n\nHarry suddenly gasped and grabbed Allen's arm\n\n\"I know who the master is! You remember that diary I found that told me about Hagrid?\" Allen's eyes widened and he nodded\n\n\"That explains everything! She must have been the one that broke into your dorm\"\n\nHarry nodded emphatically then scowled to himself\n\n\"I can't believe I trusted that lying snivelling snitch!\" He growled furiously kicking hard at a lump of rock sending it flying down the tunnel\n\n\"Look Allen, this is no more your fault than it is mine or anyone else's. Ginny came to me and Ron too you know and tried to tell us something. We didn't catch on to it either. It is the monster and it's master that is to blame for this whole mess and don't try to tell yourself anything different\"\n\nAllen gave his friend a weak smile and nodded his head, not trusting his voice enough to speak. They rounded the next corner and came face to face with an imposing shear wall of black stone into which two snakes had been masterfully carved. The two boys faced each other and exchanged grins\n\n\"Here goes nothing!\"\n\n**(1)- Just to clarify, this is his normal arm. Couldn't injure the other as he'll be needing it in the next chapter :D Ohhh I am a cruel, taunting author!**\n\n**(2)- Using my Authors licence to make up this rule. Personally I like to think this is how healing magic works (stop reading now if your not interested, this could go on for a while) The spells can only use the body's own resources aka nutrients, building blocks etc and as repearing cells takes up energy in the form of ATP if your curious, it takes a toll on the body. The spell only forces the cells to go through the replication phase faster. I prefer this explanation because it helps me sort out in my head why the magical community don't help heal muggles- because if an injury is severe enough it will kill the person, wizard or human as the spells can only use the body's resources. Therefore, if a muggle gets a fatal injury, the magical healers would be able to do no more than our doctors. In fact the only difference they would make is to the time it took to heal(with the added toll though of complete exhaustion for the patient)**\n\n**rant over :)**\n\n\n\t25. Chapter 25\n\n**A/N Tada! The proper climax chapter. I really hope you all enjoy it, I got into a bit of a run and wrote this almost all in one so there is a distinct possibility that it is not as good as I think it is, but currently, I am fairly pleased with the outcome :). Unfortunately though you may have to wait a bit for the following chapter- I'm away caravanning in the highlands so I will be without internet for a week but I made an extra effort to finish the important chapter before I left so at least I wont be leaving you hanging. Oh and I gained a number of new followers this week which has made me very, very happy! Welcome all and I hope you enjoy the story. Ps, feedback is much appreciated :P**\n\nThe imposing stone wall split in two with a resounding crack and slowly swung inward, revealing a huge cavern with a high arched ceiling supported at even intervals by towering pillars, also carved with snakes. Harry started determinedly down between the pillars, breaking into a sprint as soon as he spotted Ginny's innate body lying at the feet of a grim looking stone statue. He grabbed her by the shoulders, gently turning her over and he placed a shaking hand to the side of her neck almost collapsing with relief when he felt the faint throb of a pulse beneath his frozen fingertips. He twisted around, a huge smile lighting up his face\n\n\"Allen! She's alive\" He cried in delight. Allen was a good few feet away from him, still standing at the entrance to the cavern and Harry could hardly make him out through the gloom\n\n\"...Allen?\" He repeated nervously.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>(Allan's POV)<p>\n\nThe huge doors opened revealing a dimly light chamber. Almost as soon as he stepped over the threshold, he felt it- that presence that had been bugging him, keeping him awake through the nights. It was here. He warily took a few more steps forward and suddenly his eye activated, gears whirring as it honed in on the strangest soul Allen had ever seen. It was so unlike any Akuma he had dealt with previously. It was twisted, yes, but in a different way- as if it had been twisted long before losing its body and becoming tied to earth through magic. Just like the ghosts he had seen before, the soul occupied the same space as the 'body' and similar to the ghosts, it was clearly not being held against its will, however unlike ghosts, there _was _a chain. It extended from the back of the soul to am indistinct spot on the floor in the distance, it did not however seem to be constraining the spirit in any way, extending easily as he moved. There was another much more disturbing link though- a thin stream of gold swirling... energy? was linking the creature and Ginny whose body was now lying limply in Harry's arms. Allen had just taken in this disturbing piece of information when he heard Harry's delighted cry and he felt that tight knot of tension that had gripped him ever since he heard of Ginny's capture dissolve as he felt a rush of relief surge through his body. He knew their time was limited though- the creature was clearly draining Ginny's life force and there was no telling how much time they had before she truly was dead. There was nothing else for it. He was going to have to fight this new form of Akuma and show himself to Harry. Dumbledore could moan and gripe all he wanted about their 'agreement' and 'plan' but there was no way Allen was going to endanger Ginny's life by hiding his power just so that he could continue on at school with his new cushy life. As soon as he made that decision, his arm activated, as if it had just been waiting on that cue. Allen pulled off his white glove and ran forward, rapidly closing the gap between him and his friend\n\n\"Harry, get Ginny away from that thing! It's draining her life!\" He yelled as he ran.\n\nHarry looked up, confused. His eyes widened as soon as he saw Allen's activated arm, practically popping out of his head\n\n\"Wha...\" His jaw hung open in utter shock in an expression that would have been comical in any other situation\n\n\"No time to explain. I fight creatures like this\" He nodded in the direction of the Akuma \"My arm's a weapon\" Harry looked from Allen to the Akuma then back again and all of a sudden whipped his head back around to look at the creature as if only just registering its presence. He closed his mouth with a snap, a number of unreadable expressions crossing his face before he tightened his jaw and nodded once, in unconditional acceptance. Allen let out a breath he hadn't even realised he was holding and they both turned to face the Akuma who was scowling at Allen as if he was an unwanted guest at a party\n\n\"Hold on a second\" Harry said slowly as he finally recognised the figure in front of him \"Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean he's sucking the life out of her? He's... just a memory, right?\" He stood up, uncertainly, gripping Ginny under the armpits, clearly torn as to what he should do\n\nTom glowered at Allen \"I am far more than just a memory _Harry Potter _I have waited a long time for this and _no one\" _He spat glaring pointedly at Allen as he said this \"Is going to get in my way\"\n\nHarry straitened up, giving up on lugging Ginny's dead weight anywhere\n\n\"How did she get this way?\" He questioned, slowly moving his way in front of her body protectively. Allen was glad to see that he was finally recognising the gravity of the situation and he turned to face Tom too, curious as to the answer\n\n\"She told me things\" He said in an off-hand manner \"Opened her soul to me, let me see her innermost thoughts. It wasn't difficult for me to get control of her after that\" Allen's eyes widened in comprehension, it had been _Ginny_ painting all those messages- that explained everything\n\n\"The foolish child trusted me so much\" Riddle continued, his voice scoffing \"Didn't catch on for ages- when she did she made a pathetic attempt to get rid of the diary and that was when _you _found it Harry, everything was perfect. You have no idea how long I had waited for the chance to get a hold of you but that little _IMBOCILE _stole me back so I knew that there was only one way I could get a hold of you again\" He gestured encompassing to the chamber \"And so I set this all up, got the brat to paint her own death message in the wall and here you are\" A manic grin stretched across his face. Allen's entire body was shaking with fury. How _dare_ such a foul, twisted thing make light of poor Ginny's situation\n\n\"But\" Harry looked equally furious, his voice shaking slightly with contained anger \"Why me? What could you possibly want with me?\"\n\n\"Oh come on, surely you aren't this stupid\" He looked incredulously at both of the boy's nonplussed expressions. He let out a snort of derision and waved a wand in the air causing the words Tom Marvolo Riddle to reform and become I Am Lord Voldemort\n\n\"So tell me Harry, how does a child with no skill whatsoever defeat the greatest wizard ever to have walked this earth?\" Allen however hardly registered the heated exchange between Harry and Tom, too shocked by the realisation that Tom Riddle was holding Harry's wand\n\n* * *\n\n><p><em>Sorry, I hate to put this in because I was doing so well with re-writing the script but... Insert here the whole 'mother's protection' 'Help at Hogwarts comes to those who ask' etc stuff here and let's skip to the awesome battle stuff!<em>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Riddles manic laugh echoed chillingly around the stone chamber \"Oh this is <em>rich<em>\" He scoffed eyeing the tattered hat lying limply in Harry's arms \"I didn't expect too much from that old bat but _this. _How he ever managed to impress me I do not know. Let us see how you fare against the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir and successor to Salazar Slytherin himself with _that_ as your protection\" and with that he turned to face the statue and from his mouth came a sinister hiss. Allen readied himself, anxiously eyeing the statue\n\n\"Harry- what did he say?\" He threw across at his friend nervously, hardly daring to take his eyes off the imposing stone man.\n\n\"Shut your mouth you little wretch!\" Riddle spat venomously at Allen, gripping Harry's wand tight in his fist as he turned to him, his face twisted in fury \"This does not involve you- I want to see Harry alone fight my servant- prove that he is nothing special and that I am triumphant over all. You. Shall. _NOT get in my way\"_ Allen barely had enough time to react as Riddle pointed Harry's wand at him, sending a red flash of light straight for him. He flung himself to the side, allowing himself to skid across the damp stone- his momentum carrying him behind one of the huge stone pillars which blocked the next spell, a huge chunk of rock breaking off and spinning off into the darkness. He scrambled to his feet and crouched low, using the pillar as a shield as he tried to plan his next move. He glanced quickly over to Harry who was lying on the ground, his back against the wall his eyes wide and terrified as he looked up at the massive snake rearing before him jaws gaping- an ominous rasping hiss filling up the chamber, bouncing off the stone walls and echoing back on itself many times getting louder and louder. Allen ran out from behind the tower, not caring that he was exposing himself. He had to reach Harry before the snake did however he had hardly gotten further than a few feet before the ground in front of him literally exploded in a shower of stone shrapnel. Allen flung up his arms protecting himself, unable to contain a yell of shock which tore itself from his lips. Riddle chuckled at the sound\n\n\"What's wrong, little boy? Did you _really_ think I would just let you go like that? Think you're a match for me? _Me? _Perhaps it is a good thing you came- it has been too long since I held a wand and I think it would be a good lesson for young Harry here- to realise that not only is he incapable of fighting me but that he is also incapable of protecting his friends from me\" He threw back his head and let out a chilling laugh, mixing in the air with his pet monsters hiss. Allen scowled and changed directions. He would have to trust Harry to protect himself for the moment\n\n\"You talk too much!\" He cried, launching himself at Riddle, cursed arm outstretched, taking him by surprise and catching his arm as he twisted out of the way. Riddle's eyes widened with shock as he looked down at his arm, now leaking inky like blood out of a long, thin cut. Allen didn't give him any time to gather himself, pushing back off the ground as soon as he landed, flying toward Tom once again. Tom however reacted faster this time, leaping back so the blow just glanced off his ribs. He let out a sharp gasp, clutching his side with his hand. It was Allen's turn to laugh this time as he faced his shocked enemy\n\n\"You know for such an undefeatable enemy, you sure do seem to be able to feel pain like any other\" He risked a quick glance in Harry's direction, Riddle's new wariness giving him a little time. He let out a sigh of relief as he saw that Fawks was helping, keeping the snake busy while Harry pulled himself together. Tom unfortunately noticed this too and let out another strangled hiss. Allen had no idea what it was he was saying but he was sure that whatever it was, it wasn't good so he recklessly flung himself at Riddle again \"I'm your enemy Riddle\" He yelled as he sprinted toward him. Riddle swung around, an ugly grimace on his face. He raised his wand and shot a spell at Allen again, forcing him to veer off course halting his attack\n\n\"You are going to regret attacking me, _boy_\" He spat, shooting a number of spells in quick succession at Allen, forcing him to retreat and focus on defence. One of the spells glanced off his shoulder, exploding on contact and burning a hole strait through the materiel. Allen yelled as his skin blistered and pulled out his wand- He had hoped to get close enough, quick enough to kill him with his arm but it seemed he had no choice- this was going to be much harder than he thought.\n\nRiddle let out another shout of laughter as he saw Allen ready himself, wand in hand\n\n\"Oh surely you're not _serious? _Do you really think you can take me on with that? As if a pathetic little boy like you could ever...\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, you are the most powerful wizard ever to walk to the earth I get it already\" Allen interrupted, raising his wand and shooting a stunning spell at Riddle which he easily deflected, retaliating with immense speed, sending a thick stream of a quick-silver like substance toward him. Allen flung himself out of the way, landing clumsily on the ground a few feet away. The liquid hit the space where he had been mere moments ago. The stone floor hissed and bubbled as a huge crater was eaten out of it. Another spell hit him before he even had time to regain his feet and all of a sudden everything was obliterated as pain shot through every nerve in his body and a terrible scream burst from his lips as his entire body contorted uncontrollably. The pain went on for what seemed like years before all of a sudden it stopped. All of his limbs trembled as he weakly pushed himself to his feet, stumbling back, his arms raised defensively.\n\n\"Do you understand now boy? Do you now comprehend fully who it is you are dealing with? This is no petty school dual. You may as well give up now. I promise if you do, I will make your end swift and painless\" Riddle said, leering unpleasantly at Allen's trembling form\n\n\"Allen!\" Harry cried- glancing quickly over before turning his full attention back to the huge reptile before him\n\n\"Don't worry about me Harry, I'm fine\" Allen yelled, his voice shaking slightly. He turned back to Riddle, deliberatly making his movements slow and jerky, wiping his hand across his lip, which he had split when he hit the ground\n\n\"My name isn't _boy, _Riddle. It's Allen. And I. Will. Defeat you\" He whipped out his wand and yelled \"_Stupify\" _with all his might. The spell went way wide of the mark and hit one of the pillars a good few feet away from Riddle. He turned to face Allen, one eyebrow raised incredulously\n\n\"That was truly pathetic\" He sneered but Allen just smiled blithely\n\n\"Oh really?\" He said innocently. Riddle's eyes widened in panic as he turned around again to see the huge stone pillar toppling towards him. He raised his wand to halt its descent when\n\n\"_Expeliarmus\" _A jet of red light struck the wand, sending it spinning off into the darkness. Riddle desperately threw himself out of the way of the plummeting column of stone, landing with a thud on the ground. Allen was on him as soon as soon as he fell and he raised his activated arm, forming a clumsy fist despite his claws and punched Riddle in the face with all his might\n\n\"That's for Ginny\" He yelled, raising his arm again, claws outstretched this time. Riddle reached up and grabbed his elbow and punched him in the stomach with his other arm. The blow was weak however due to his awkward position. Allen twisted his arm out of Riddles grasp but before he could swipe at him again, Riddle sat up, powering his head up into the bottom of Allen's jaw, throwing him off and causing red spots to dance in front of his eyes. He raised himself up and the two boys circled each other, waiting for an opening. Riddle powered forward, trying to tackle Allen to the ground but Allen sidestepped at the last moment and twisted himself around, placing his hand on the back of Riddle's neck and using his own momentum to throw him to the ground before clawing his back, causing him to scream in pain. Riddle twisted around and threw himself explosively off his back onto his feet and circling Allen once again, more warily this time\n\n\"You think you can take me?\" He snarled \"Well think again- Just look\" He jerked his head over in Harry's direction. Allen narrowed his eyes slightly at Riddle, trying to figure out if it was a bluff before glancing quickly in his friend's direction. The huge serpent lay motionless in a heap and Allen could only just make out the crumpled figure of Harry, enormously dwarfed by the monster next to him. He returned his gaze to Riddle, warily circling his enemy\n\n\"Harry?\" He yelled, not moving his gaze \"You alright mate?\" There was no reply. A bead of cold sweat ran down Allen's face as he continued to circle Riddle, his entire body tense, buzzing as he waited for his next move\n\n\"He's been bitten by my basilisk, he'll be dead in just a few moments. You have failed Allen. You will all die here by my hand\" He flung himself at Allen again, punching him hard in the gut, driving all the air out of his body. Allen hit the ground, gasping desperately for air however instead of attacking him again, Riddle ran off in the direction that Harry's wand had flown **(1)**. Allen forced himself to his feet, ignoring the pain and the cold fist of dread that was cruelly twisting his innards. Forcing himself not to think, he charged at Tom, flying silently along the ground putting an extra sput of speed on as he neared, slashing once again at him with his claws, raking them along his side. The injuries he was causing were a lot less severe than they would be on a normal human but he still managed to draw more inky blood.\n\n\"Don't think this is over Tom\" He spat as they both wrested back and forward\n\n\"I will fight you with everything I have, until my last breath\"\n\nTom punched Allen hard in the ribs, his blow more powerful than any humans and Allen actually heard two of his ribs crack. With a cry of pain, he stumbled back, clutching his side with his right arm, still holding his cursed arm defensively in front of him. He charged again, ducking low under another blow, driving his fist up using all the power from his legs and core, connecting right under the rib cage. Riddle let out a scream of pain as the power of the blow flung him backwards across the floor. Allen too let out a yell of pain as his ribs complained loudly. Gritting his teeth, he staggered forward and resumed what was beginning to feel like a hopeless battle. No matter how many blows he landed, he didn't seem to be doing lethal damage. Any one of the hits he had landed would have killed any other Akuma he had fought but this, this was different. He was beginning to suspect that until the diary was destroyed, there would be no winning this fight. The two boys wrestled back and forward, both landing blows but neither gaining the upper hand as they both tried to drive the fight in opposite directions, Riddle toward the spot where Harry's wand lay and Allen towrd the spot where the diary lay. Riddle punched Allen hard again in his injured ribs causing his grip to loosen. He tried to repeat the move but Allen twisted out of the way, grabbing Riddles arm and threw him over his shoulder, slamming him hard on the ground, driving all the air out of his lungs. Then out of the darkness, Allen heard the most amazing sound in the world\n\n\"Allen!\" Whatever had happened over the other side of the chamber, Harry was alive. As soon as he head Harry's voice, Riddles face became a twisted mask of fury and he began to fight like a wild animal, wrenching himself out of Allen's grasp and running in Harry's direction. Allen grabbed his legs, tripping him up\n\n\"Quick Harry\" He yelled as he tried to hold Riddle's flailing form down, receiving a bloody nose for his trouble as he kicked hard against the boys vice like grip\n\n\"_The diary! Get the d-\"_ Riddle's foot connected solidly with Allen's mouth, effectively shutting him up and causing his grip to slip. Riddle scrambled to his feet and began to all out sprint towards Harry. Allen followed, close on his heels, desperation driving him on\n\n\"Wretched Akuma, may your soul be annihilated!\" He cried as he collided hard with him, sending him flying, gripping him hard around the neck as Harry plunged the snake's fang deep into the book. Riddles form shuddered and convulsed beneath his grip before his body became completely insubstantial and decapitated into nothing. The two boys remained in their position, bodies trembling with exhaustion and adrenaline\n\n\"He... he's gone?\" Harry said, his voice sounding too loud in the tense silence. Allen glanced around the chamber, his gaze resting on the slightly smoking diary.\n\n\"I think it's over\" He said, wonder evident in his tone. Neither one however moved from their positions until Ginny stirred, moaning as she came too. Her eyes grew widened in terror as she took in her surroundings and her eyes filled with tears as she saw Harry and Allen, both looking half-dead\n\n\"I tried to tell you, I swear I did but I just couldn't. It was _me_ but I didn't mean it I swear I didn't\" The tears spilled down her cheeks and her shoulders shook with silent sobs. Allen crouched down beside her and gently rubbed her back in small soothing circles making comforting sounds. She lent her head against him and began to cry properly as he gently rocked her, enveloping her in his arms protectively. Harry shuffled his feet awkwardly, silently grateful that Allen was dealing with it instead of him- he just seemed to know the right thing to say whereas Ginny crying was making him nearly wish the basilisk was still alive so he would have something else to do other than try not to put his foot in it. Allen murmured a few words in Ginny's ear and she gave him a watery smile, then nodded, getting to her feet, tears gone. Harry did a double take and looked in complete confusion at Allen who just smirked teasingly at him\n\n\"What are you waiting for, Harry? Let's go\"\n\n**(1) Just a quick side note for anyone who is interested- Voldemort went for his wand for two reasons. A- Killing someone by hand is not exactly the easiest thing in the world to do, especially when you are not used to hand to hand combat and B- Because Voldemort is irrefutably proud of his wizarding abilities- he would only use muggle methods as a last resort :)**\n\n\n\t26. Chapter 26\n\n**A/N- Read this! My A/N will be huge this time (sorry) I'll reply to reviews in order of size so you can skip the end bit if you really want to coz there will be a lot :) I'd appreciate reviewers reading my _second_ last reply though if you don't mind as it applies to you. Here goes!**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Thank you so much :) I'm really glad you enjoyed it!**\n\n**DarkKittehKat- Haha, thank you so much and welcome to the... reviewers? Story? Erm... Welcome to both :) And I will do my utmost to keep writing this don't worry!**\n\n**muffinfluffy- Thank you ^^ I'm happy you like it. Welcome to the reviewers too. P.S. I'm loving the username :D**\n\nFrom here, I wouldn't mind opinions on what I put in my replies as it is story and plot related. Thanks everyone :D\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Ah, thank you so much. It's great to hear that as I haven't really had any feedback as of yet about it. I just find it a lot better to only put in _my_ parts of the story. I don't want to just repeat the book because not only is it boring for me but its boring for everyone else. I do try to just re-write the most important bits but its not always easy to put an original twist on everything so thanks for the moral boost :D Oh and I will be trying to keep Allen as separate from the order as possible while trying to keep them in the picture. A lot of reviewers really want them to meet soon but I want to keep contact to a minimum if possible :)**\n\n**Inkdawn- Thanks for the feedback :), I will try to keep my updates as regular as possible, my life should be settling down again now so I should be able to get back into routine again. If you (and anyone else) wouldn't mind, could you expand a bit on what you mean. Do you want my chapters to be larger and to contain more character development and non-plot advancing things or do you want them to be longer with more plot because I could do either but the second would probably mean my updates would be less frequent. Oh and welcome to the reviewers too :D**\n\nTHIS REVIEW IS PLOT IMPORTANT!\n\n**777angeloflove asked why Allen didn't just destroy the diary and here is why**\n\n**a) Initially, he didn't actually know precisely where and/or what it was that was tying Riddle to the world, bear in mind that this was his first encounter with anything other than ghosts or akuma**\n\n**b)Harry was being attacked by a ginormous snake, at this point, Allen's main concern was to distract Riddle so that he wouldn't i) Attack Harry himself (remember, Allen hasn't read the books so he doesn't know Riddle doesn't try to attack personally) or ii) Egg the snake on further**\n\n**I'm **_**not**_** making Allen one of those irritating heroes that is indestructible. Remember, he is hardly capable at this stage of taking on three level ones let alone Lord Voldemort, even if it is a mere echo of him. This is why even after figuring out the diary thing, he fails to destroy it. Remember he **_**does**_** try to reach it but fails because Riddle is too powerful**\n\n**Allen's innocence is not yet fully synced (hence his failure to pierce Riddle's skin) and this along with a lack of experience is the reason he had such a tough time destroying him. He **_**did**_** manage injury but I am making this battle mirror the level four one- remember, he could inure but not kill them too.**\n\n**Finally though I wish to say that his Innocence CAN and WILL destroy horcruxes ;)**\n\n**Thank you very much by the way angeloflove and inkdawn- It's reviewers like you that keep us writers on our toes :D**\n\nThe three weary teens stumbled back along the winding stone tunnel, arms intertwined as they all supported each other. Ginny was in the middle of the two boys leaning her head wearily against Allen's chest as they walked, her eyes shut as she allowed them to lead her. Allen gave Ginny a little shake as they neared the wall of fallen rocks which now had a sizable hole burrowed out of the side. A huge grin spread across Allen's face as he saw the heartfelt reunion of the two siblings, both of them embracing through the wall of stone, neither willing to let go so the other could climb through. He couldn't suppress though the bitter pang that shot through his heart as he thought of little Mai still on her own, unreachable. Tears pricked his eyes but he just clenched his fist hard, digging his nails into his hand and forced them back. He was not going to allow his selfishness to ruin this moment. Ron and Ginny eventually let go long enough for her to climb through and Allen started toward the gap but before he could reach it, Harry laid a hand on his shoulder\n\n\"I won't say anything to them alright? It is your story to tell whenever you feel ready\"\n\nAllen opened his mouth and realised that he had no idea what to say so he just nodded and hoped that Harry understood how grateful he was\n\n\"And don't worry alright, now that this is sorted, Mai will be back before you know it\" He gave Allen's shoulder a quick squeeze and then followed Ginny through the hole. Allen took a deep breath to steady himself before following. By now he had reached that stage of physical and emotional exhaustion that everything just felt fuzzy and vague- like he was watching some old vcr tape. He wasn't even aware of his movements and was functioning completely on autopilot until a fiery drink burned its way down his throat sharpening everything and dragging him roughly back into consciousness again. He was sitting in some teacher's office or other, Harry on his other side and Dumbledore in front of him\n\n\"Welcome back\" He said, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips\n\n\"Now that you have re-joined us, I believe an account of exactly what happened in that chamber is required\" He leaned back in his seat and steapled his fingers, gazing intently at both the boys, his eyes piercing as ever\n\n\"Please try not to leave anything out. As soon as you are done, I shall get Madame Pomfrey to give you a once over- I know she is desperate to get her hands on you both- and then after that, a feast\"\n\nAllen sat bolt upright in his seat\n\n\"A feast?\" He cried his face lighting up. Dumbledore chuckled\n\n\"Report first, then you may eat as much as you like\"\n\nAllen launched into the events ever since Dumbledore left, talking quickly but clearly and business like. Harry filled in some of the gaps and added his encounter with the basilisk to the story. Once both of the boys had finished, a comfortable silence fell over the group until it was broken by Allen's growling stomach. He threw Dumbledore a pleading look and the headmaster laughed again\n\n\"Off you go then, to Madame Pomfrey first though\" Allen was out of his seat as soon as the words had left his lips. Harry rose to follow him but Dumbledore raised his hand\n\n\"I am afraid I must detain you a little longer Harry, though I will allow you strait to the feast when we are done- Fawk's tear will have healed all your injuries so you need not go to the hospital wing. Harry shot Allen a smug look at this and Allen retaliated by childishly sticking out his tongue before he left and the door shut with a snap.\n\nDumbledore leant back in his chair and sighed\n\n\"I think it is now I who must offer an explanation. I am referring of course to the secret which Allen and I have kept from you throughout the year. It was at my request that he held his peace and therefore it is my responsibility to clear things up for you\" He pored himself a glass of the same crimson liquid he had given to Allen before and took a large gulp before launching into his speech, sounding significantly more like a Professor lecturing a class of students than a man revealing a grave secret\n\n\"There are many magical substances throughout this world, Harry. Natural things such as unicorn horns or- perhaps a more fitting example- Mandrake root. We wizards know about a few of these substances and use them often to make man-made things, such as the antidote to petrification, or a potion to prolong life. Many of these substances can conduct magical energy and these are used as the cores for our wands. Substances like dragon horn, unicorn tail or\" He gestured toward Harry's own wand \"Phoenix tail feathers. Allen's arm is... possessed, perhaps is the best word for it, by a magical substance which most refer to as 'Innocence' and it is this which gives his arm that deformed appearance and also gives him the powers you saw today. He and a select group of others posses the ability to use the 'innocence' much like some humans contain the ability to use 'magic'. Allen however is special, he is- to our best knowledge- the only person to contain both the power of 'magic' _and _the power to wield 'innocence'. He also appears to be the only one with the Innocence actually as part of his body. Innocence can be used to separate souls with no body from whatever is holding them to this earth and allow them to pass on to the great beyond. As with most things on this earth however, it has a counter- substance which is used by a man named the Millennium Earl to trap unwilling souls and force them to do his bidding. Allen has been fighting these 'Akuma' as he calls them, throughout the year- hence his disappearances. There is another group of Innocence wielders called the 'Black Order' who also fight the Millennium Earl however they are a very cultish like group and are a rule unto themselves with the head of their groups word being law. They do not take kindly to people that do not fit into their ideals or expectations and are not adverse to human testing. You can understand then why I wished to keep the knowledge of Allen's existence secret from them. Not only is this an issue but our own Ministry can be... difficult when it comes to powers that they do not comprehend and to be honest I do not think their reaction to finding out about Allen would be much better than the Orders\" He had risen from his chair and paced the floor throughout the speech but now came and leaned on the arms of Harry's chair fixing those electric blue eyes on Harry's own green ones\n\n\"You have to understand this Harry and take it seriously. _No one_ can know about Allen other than you and perhaps Ron and Hermione. It must go no further. For either of these communities to lean about Allen or to even learn of each other would be catastrophic for all involved. Do you understand me?\"\n\nHarry nodded, trying to look as mature as possible and convey just how seriously he was taking this. While he now felt much more concerned for his friend, he felt the tight knot of tension that had formed over the year dissolve and he couldn't help but feel a little lighter and happier for it. At least now he knew that Allen was every bit the man he thought he had been and that he hadn't been putting his faith in a fraud- in someone hiding their true evil intents behind a masquerade of plastic smiles and empty words. His friend was truly everything he had hoped and yearned for him to be, and now that he knew, there was no need for there to be any more secrets. He, Ron and Hermione could help him, support him. Hermione... she would be waking up from her petrification any moment now. She was going to be _insufferably_ smug once she found out that Allen had been innocent all along but even the thought of her I-told-you-so look wasn't enough to stop the wide grin from spreading over his face nor was it enough to stop him from sprinting his way along the corridors and down the stairs with a blatant disregard for the school rules and the lecturing portraits to burst into the great hall, packed with milling school kids, still in their pyjamas, all cheering and singing as they celebrated the return of friends and the destruction of the evil mood that had sunk over the castle. Harry pushed through the crowds of students, not even bothering to pause and apologise until he saw them. Allen was sitting in the middle of Ron and Hermione, thoroughly wrapped in bandages, his hand resting on Ginny's shoulder as she knelt in front of him, chatting shyly to the three, her head resting contentedly on Allen's knee. As soon as they spotted him, their faces light up and he was engulfed in the most energetic group hug he had ever been unfortunate enough to receive. Eventually they let him go and after his lungs stopped feeling like crushed crisp packets, he joined in with the chat and banter that was flying across the group, a warm feeling burning brightly in his chest. To top it all off, Hagrid appeared, finally freed by the ministry, looking a little worse for the wear. Harry joined in this time in the very violent welcome group hug they gave him- not that it made much of an impression on him, he just beamed with pleasure and hugged them back, causing their breath to rush out of their lungs and Allen's ribs to creak ominously. They ushered him into a seat and ran back and forth to the table bringing entire platters of food to try and sate both his and Allen's apatite. Allen seemed determined to make up for lost time and was devouring everything within arm's reach whether or not anyone else was holding it and as the night wore on and the chatter died down, Harry looked contentedly around the Great Hall, packed with sleepy, contented students and felt more at home than he ever had before in his life.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Eventually, after much chivvying from the teachers, the sleepy students were convinced that their bed s would be much comfier than the stone floor of the hall and there was a mass migration up to the separate dorms. Mumbled 'goodnights' and 'see you laters' were exchanged before they all collapsed, exhausted into their respective four posters. Harry had just enough energy to kick off his shoes before he fell into a deep, peaceful sleep<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry was vaguely aware of an irritating noise. He rolled over and moaned slightly but it didn't stop so he opened one eye, annoyed at being disturbed. Mai was sitting on top of Allen's bed, obviously having been delivered back by the Ministry too. She was talking quickly and was taking bug gulps of air every time she stopped for breath<p>\n\n\"...and they said that I was being a baby and I had to stop crying but I couldn't and they wouldn't let me see you and I tried to run away but they caught me and told me I was bad and I wasn't allowed to write to you so I bit them and they shouted and me and I told them they weren't allowed to take me away from you and then they told me that you weren't even my daddy so I punched them and then they bled...\" she started sobbing, he entire form shaking with her cries. Allen embraced her, a single tear running down his own cheek as he planted a small kiss on her head\n\n\"Come on\" He said, in a fake cheery voice \"No crying. Your back now, that's what counts and I am never letting you go again, OK?\" Her sobs decreased slightly in volume\n\n\"Besides, what would those silly people know about you and me huh? Were they with us in Japan? Did they see all those nights that we would sit and tell stories till we fell asleep or do they know about all the times we snuck into the circus and went on the merry-go round as many times as we wanted? They had no right to tell you who you are and who I am. They don't know a thing about us and what we have been through\" There was a low note of anger in his voice but he kept his tone soft, his fury only betrayed by his face. Mai hiccupped as her tears slowed and she sat up wiping at her eyes. Allen quickly schooled his expression back to neutrality\n\n\"But they said you were too young to be my daddy\" She insisted, her voice pleading as she waited for her Pappy to explain everything away\n\n\"You remember don't you Mai, what I have always told you right? When a baby is born, it is made by a mummy and daddy but sometimes the mummy and daddy can't look after their baby and have to let someone else do it for them. Your mummy and daddy had something wrong with their hearts and so I had to look after you instead and that means that I did everything for you that your parents would have done and I love you just as if you really were my little girl so to me, you are and always will be my little denka\" He gently brushed her hair out of her face and wiped the tears from her cheeks. Mai sniffed and gave a watery smile, lifting her own hand and resting it gently on Allen's cheek\n\n\"And you'll always be my Papa, Jibo\" Allen smiled and embraced her again, burying his face in her back so she couldn't see his tears\n\n\"Tell you what Mai, why not break a couple rules to celebrate eh? Take your pick of these\" He said cheerily, gesturing at the 'get well soon' gifts stacked around his bed \"We'll take it down to the lake for a naughty breakfast and I'll explain to you exactly what happened here and why you were taken away. Does that sound good to you?\" Mai nodded enthusiastically and scrambled off the bed, making a beeline for the biggest boxes of sweets she could find, eventually unearthing the largest of them all- a box of Honeyduke's chocolate assortments. Allen laughed lightly and scooped her up, placing her on his shoulder and tucking the box under his arm. On his way out of the dorm he turned slightly, giving a sly wink to Harry showing that his faux sleeping had not been convincing enough before turning and exiting through the door, letting it swing softly shut behind him.\n\n\n\t27. Chapter 27\n\n**A/N- An extra large chapter to make up for the wait :P**\n\n**777angeloflove- Yeah, I was missing Mai so much I just had to get her back. Besides, depressive Allen isn't nearly as much fun (nor as cute) as parental Allen :P**\n\n**Raychael Dionzeros- Haha, well I'm glad your enjoying it! P.S. More sweetness to come!**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Thank you and YES I HAVE! One Summer chap comin' up**\n\n**D.A-H.A- Yeah, I have most of the plan figured out. You may see some of that coming up in the next book/year *hinthinthint* It will be pretty complicated though :S**\n\n**sammi117- I did quit want to have her pwn Malfoy again but there wasn't really time and it didn't seem to fit. I'm sure I'll manage to make it happen again before the end though!**\n\n**Coronadomontes- Unfortunately no, there will be Voldemort, the Death Eaters, The Millenium Earl **_**and **_**his followers (Including Noah and Akuma) To deal with. Remember though this story stars two hero's. :D**\n\nFrom that day on, Mai never left Allen's side. She clung to him as if terrified that she would be taken away again and he seemed to be thinking along the same lines. She sat in on the last few days of lessons which were fairly informal anyway but Harry suspected guilt had a fair bit to do with the teacher's new lenience. The change in Allen had been obvious even to those who didn't spend much time with him when Mai had been taken from him. His happy-go-lucky attitude had completely disappeared to be replaced by a silent, depressed version and the transformation had shocked everyone. Even _Snape_ had allowed Mai into his class, provided that she didn't so much as move without his permission. It was a testament to her determination that she actually kept absolutely quiet and still through the whole lesson though she more than made up for it later during break. Harry played more games of tag and hide and seek in those last few days than he had ever played before in his life. Seeing Mai and Allen back together and so happy made him somewhat wistful as he thought of how different his life would have been if he had had someone- _anyone _- with which to play and love throughout his childhood. It wouldn't matter if they had been related to him, nor what age, race or even species they were. Something that seeing Allen with Mai had taught him was that the only thing that really mattered was that there was love for if there truly was love, nothing bad would come of it. He was proving that true even now, building relationships with Ron, Hermione, Allen even Dobby and Hedwig, only now being able to build that trusting relationship that he had missed out on through his childhood. In a way, it made the relationships more intimate and special. His friends had become his family, in the same sense that Allen had become Mai's Dad and regardless of the science and the logic that told him there was no family link there, he felt it and trusted in it. He was miserably reflecting on this as he packed his things into his trunk once again, slowly folding up and stowing away one by one. He stood up and looked around the bare dorm. Already he could feel the trepidation building up in his heart, already Hogwarts was feeling less and less like home as it emptied in preparation for the summer and as people started discussing how and where they were going to spend their holidays. Holidays. The ultimate endurance sport for him. At least this time though, he would be receiving letters- unless he managed to get on the wrong side of another house elf. The dorm door swung open and Allen came in, Mai trailing behind him, a handful of his robes clenched tight in her fist\n\n\"You packed yet Harry? Yours is the final trunk to be loaded onto the carriages\" He said gazing around the deserted dorm as he spoke\n\n\"Woah this is weird. It feels... strange. Too empty\" Harry nodded in agreement\n\n\"Yeah. I'm ready. Let's go\" He turned around and hefted his trunk up in his arms, refusing to meet Allen's inquisitive gaze. Allen stepped forward and gripped the other end of the trunk, silently offering support. Mai, being her usual helpful self, climbed up on top of the trunk and perched on the lid- claiming that she was going to be 'lookout' and bossily directed them throughout the school. After the third set of stairs, Harry began to seriously regret leaving his packing so late- if he had done it the night before the trunk would have been taken down for him. He set his end of the trunk down and lent against it panting\n\n\"How. Much. Further?\" He asked between gulps of air. Allen set down his end too and raised an amused eyebrow at his friend\n\n\"You've still got four to go! Surely you're not out of energy _already..._ I thought after taking on a giant basilisk a couple staircases like this would be a cake walk\" Amusement thrummed trough his voice as he very obviously tried to hold back his laughter. Harry glared up at his smirking friend as intimidatingly as he could with Mai poking his forehead and giggling at him\n\n\"Oh, shoosht you\" He grumbled, standing up again \"I'd rather take on another four basilisks than another four set of stairs\" He looked despairingly down at the trunk where Mai was once again perched on the lid, her arms folded stubbornly and her eyes daring him to try and remove her. Allen laughed and put a finger to his lips before muttering under his breath \"_Wingardeum Leviosa\" _\n\nMai let out a cry of delight as the trunk moved effortlessly into the air\n\n\"Just for the next three floors\" Allen said, his eyes dancing with mischievousness \"and then I'm afraid you'll just have to man up\" Harry stuck his tongue out before falling into step with Allen, the trunk bobbing behind them like a strange balloon as they descended the next set of stairs\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen helped Harry to heft the huge trunk onto the roof rack of the carriage and after petting the invisible creature that was pulling them, he swung up into the rickety vehicle, sitting next to Hermione. He reached his arms out for Mai, gesturing with one hand to Harry who obliged, lifting the squirming bundle of energy up to her papa<p>\n\n\"How come you're coming down with us?\" He asked as he too swung himself up, sitting next to Ron and warily eyeing Mai who was opposite him- though she was too busy half hanging out of the window in order to see the last of Hogwarts to pay much attention to him\n\n\"I thought you'd have left with Dumbledore\"\n\nAllen gripped Mai tight round the waist to prevent her from tumbling headfirst out onto the road\n\n\"Well, Dumbledore has some business or other to take care of and Mai really, _really_ wanted to get a train ride so we are going to get the train in with you guys and then get a bus to his house\" At the word 'train' Mai pulled her head back in and began to expound to all of them the many delights of trains her words tripping and tumbling over themselves with her excitement as she finished her sentences almost before she had started them. Allen rolled his eyes indulgently as he talked over her chatter \"She didn't get to sleep till about 3 this morning with excitement\" He moaned, and now that he mentioned it, Harry noticed the dark bags beneath his eyes. The way things had been recently, Allen had to wait until Mai was fast asleep before venturing out on his scouting missions as she refused to go to sleep without him there beside her. Thankfully she never caught on to his disappearances but Harry had been on edge the whole of the last week, terrified that he would have to deal with her if she woke up to find her papa gone. The chatter of the students as they boarded the train was almost deafening and the four teenagers (with Mai on Harry's shoulders) had to cling tightly together to prevent themselves from being swept away in the press. Eventually though they fought their way to an empty compartment and collapsed inside, slamming the door shut. A battle immediately ensued about who got the window seat Ron and (not surprisingly) Mai won. With a rattle and screech, the train pulled away from the station slowly but steadily building up pace. All five of them crowded around the window, straining to see the last of the castle, returning reluctantly to their seats a long while after the last glimpse of its extensive grounds had disappeared from sight. Ron pulled a pack of cards out of his back pocket \"Anyone for a game of cards?\" He asked brightly, dealing them out on the table \"We can play for our supply of sweets!\"\n\nHermione turned her nose up at the 'vulgar' game and curled up in her seat, a stack of books at her side. Allen and Harry both opted in willingly accepting their hands and pulling out their sweets and arranging them on the table, sorting them into values depending on type- with Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans being equivalent to 1p all the way up to Honeyduke's chocolate bars being equivalent to £1000. Allen shifted slightly, moving Mai's head from his shoulder to his lap so he could reach the table easier. She had run around like a mad thing for the first 10 minutes or so exploring every inch of the place before her exhaustion finally caught up with her and she fell sound asleep\n\n\"You sure you want to play Allen\" Ron smirked playingly \"Your pile of candy has suffered some serious collateral damage from your delightful daughter and I'll have you know, I am raining champion at cards\" Harry laughed at his friends antics\n\n\"Oh, that sounds like fighting talk!\" He turned to Allen who seemed to be surrounded by a dark aura. He chuckled menacingly \"Let's see who's holding that title at the end of the game shall we?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry miserably pushed over his last handful of every flavour beans into Allen's now mountainous pile. Allen happily shuffled the cards again, casually fanning them out onto the table<p>\n\n\"Another round, gentleman?\" He said in a scarily innocent voice. Harry shuddered; it was freaky hearing someone speak so politely right after they just cleared you out effortlessly. Ron's confidence had completely dissolved and he was glowering at what little of Allen he could see from behind his sweets \"You are cheating. You _must_ be cheating! There's no _way _you are that good\" He cried in protest, cupping his hands protectively around his remaining liquorice wand and chocolate frog. Allen chuckled darkly again \"Just you try and prove it! It's not cheating if you don't get caught!\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" Ron cried triumphantly and practically leapt over the table but after forcing Allen to roll up his sleeves, checking for mirrors and earning a slap from Hermione for asking if she was leaking clues he slumped down on the table in defeat\n\n\"No faaaair\" He wailed. \"I was looking forward to eating those so much\" He turned puppy eyes onto Allen but he was oblivious to it as he counted his winnings, a frightening grin stretching wide across his face\n\n\"You still have a little left there I see, how about another game. Your luck may just turn\" Ron pulled a face and hugged his remaining sweets to his chest. \"No way!\" Harry and Hermione joined forces in laughing at his bad luck \"Don't cry Ron\" Hermione said, having put down her book to watch the unfolding drama \"Allen's just teasing you- he's going to give you the sweets back\" Both Harry and Ron immediately turned to look imploringly at Allen whose expression could only be described as 'deer in the headlights' \"What? I am? No way! I won them fair and square!\" He squealed as he tried to hug his huge pile of sweets to himself. Hermione fixed her most disapproving look on him and he held out pretty well considering- lasting about 5 minutes before caving in (very reluctantly) and handing back the sweets to Ron and Harry\n\n\"Sweeeeeet!\" Ron cried in delight \"Cheers Hermione\" She glowered at him\n\n\"You're _so _childish, Ronald\" she hissed before curling up on her seat and picking up the book she just finished, flicking back to the beginning and commencing reading again. Ron gave Harry a bewildered look before shrugging his shoulders and digging into his replenished supplies of chocolate frogs with gusto while Allen watched muttering discontentedly beneath his breath\n\n* * *\n\n><p>All too soon, they pulled in at Kings Cross and disembarked from the train. Allen awkwardly trailed behind the group, trying to hold a still sleeping Mai with one hand and drag his trunk with the other. Harry lagged back to help, in no hurry to exit the barrier and meet his family once again. Allen smiled and thanked him when he took the trunk from him, wheeling it alongside his own. \"Thank you Harry. And don't look so down in the dumps! This summer will be better. You'll see. I might even be able to wangle some free time out of Dumbledore and come down to see you\" Harry smiled at his friend, glad that he was trying to help but still unable to shake that trepidation that was building up in his heart as he neared the barrier. One by one they slipped back through into the muggle world. Harry could see Uncle Vernon glowering over at him, his piggy eyes widened with shock and disgust as he registered Allen's shock of white hair and scar. Allen grinned and gave him a friendly wave \"Wow, I don't know what you've been complaining about Harry! He looks like a real charmer\" Hermione hugged him tight \"We'll write lots <em>won't we Ronald\"<em> She shot Ron a meaningful look and he chuckled sheepishly \"Yeah, promise mate. And if your podgy relatives really get on your nerves, just drop us a note. We'll come pick you up in a flying bulldozer next time. See if we can't give old tubster there a proper aneurism\" Harry laughed and hugged them all, even allowing a dozy Mai to climb into his arms and give him a peck on the cheek before returning her to Allen's arms where she promptly fell asleep again.\n\n\"I'll see you all soon\" He said rather wistfully as he walked toward his uncle, who, as soon as he saw Harry moving his way walked off, anxious that no one would realize that they were actually related\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry laughed as he sorted through his bundle of presents, keeping as quiet as possible. The last thing he wanted was for the Dursley's to find out he had actually received presents this year. He was just sitting down to read the Quidditch book he had been given when there was an impatient rap on the window. He got up to see Timcampy flapping wildly, trying to stay airborne with his load of parcels. Harry hurriedly opened the window and relieved the tiny creature of his load. Once relieved of the load, Tim shook out his wings and sped around the room as if to prove that he was a very good flier when now cumbered with 3 huge packages. Harry delighted tore into the first box to find a small birthday cake, the decoration on it was... well... a little chaotic. Every form of decoration was haphazardly sprinkled over the white icing which had been spiked up into huge peaks on some places while other sections lay bare. Harry bit a chunk out of the edge, deciding that as he wasn't sharing it, he may as well dig in. It was <em>heavenly<em>, light sponge with blueberry jam in the centre- the sweet icing counteracting the tart blueberries. He closed his eyes in extecy and savoured the treat when he heard a noise. He opened his eyes and saw... _Allen?_ His heart resumed its normal rhythm after he noticed Tim and realised it was the projection of a recording\n\n\"Hey Harry, happy birthday!\" Allen said grinning widely and waving \"Hopefully Tim actually survived the journey... I actually made a much bigger cake for you but Tim appears to have scared off all the owls and he couldn't carry it by himself so I made you that one. Don't feel too bad though, it was a terrible hardship but I managed to force myself to eat it for you\" He smirked as he said this, mirth bubbling up in his voice \"So, onto your presents. Mai insisted that we explain them properly so you'll have to open them on my cue, ok?\" Harry tugged the string holding the boxes together off and settled himself comfortably on his bed, taking another big bite out of the _oh my goodness still heavenly_ cake \"Alright, first open the one wrapped by Mai\" Harry immediately picked up the parcel covered in crayon drawings of rainbows and unicorns, carefully tugging the cellotape off so that the paper didn't rip. He tipped the odd assortment of object out on the bed and looked in confusion at the projector in hopes of an explanation \"Right now, first, see that... erm... straw\"\n\nMai's voice came from off screen \"No, Jibo, its _reeds_\" Allen rolled his eyes slightly\n\n\"Right of course. OK then see that _reed_ toy\" but Mai interrupted him again\n\n\"It's a _doll_\" Allen sighed and ran his hands through his hair\n\n\"You come explain it then!\" Mai ran onto screen and sat down straightening out her skirt and fixing a childishly serious look on Tim making Harry snort with laughter\n\n\"It's a _reed doll_ and I made it\" Harry picked up the bundle of reeds he assumed she was talking about, There was two pieces of twine tied around the bent bundle of reeds and a stick jammed through the middle making rather lopsided arms\n\n\"It's your present coz you are there and we are here and it's a magic doll\" She leant forward, her face filling up the screen, eyes sincere\n\n\"It's magic coz I made it and I love you so it loves you and when your meany uncle and aunt and cousin are mean you can hug it and it'll make it so your hugging me\" A small smile tugged at Harry's lips as he tried to swallow the lump that had appeared in his throat. He turned the doll over in his hands, and it seemed all of a sudden much more precious.\n\n\"The bottle of sand is because you need a birthday wish\" Mai continued, unaware of the effect of her first gift\n\n\"See, once upon a time, there was a big battle on our beach\" Harry assumed by this she meant the beach beside Dumbledore's house\n\n\"The fairies battled the pixies and they won but some of them died but it was ok because when fairies die, they turn to fairy dust and they aren't really dead and they made the sand sparkle with their dust so I put some into a bottle coz fairies are magical and the can be generated again\" Harry laughed at her childish speech as he lifted up the small bottle of sand attached to a length of twine \"And when they generate again\" Mai continued\n\n\"They will give you a wish so that's your birthday wish. I had to do it that way because Pappy wouldn't let me light you're candle in your birthday cake\" As soon as she finished the speech, she ran over to hug Time and disappeared off screen again. Allen laughed as he watched her disappear\n\n\"I know, I am such a mean father, imagine not letting her send a lit candle to you\" Harry tucked the small glass bottle in under his t-shirt and picked up the next, flat package which he assumed was from Allen\n\n\"The other present is sort of a cheat one\" Allen said, rather sheepishly \"I was out with Dumbledore on one of his many, _many_ business meetings and came across this. I got it at a major discount because it's just a prototype and I think the inventor was hoping to win Dumbledore over by giving it to me\" Harry tore the wrapping paper off to reveal a smooth wooden picture frame sporting a blank canvas. He turned it over, wondering if he was looking at the wrong end but the back was just plain wood.\n\n\"It's the next big thing since photography\" Allen said, voice booming as he mimicked a salesman \"Are you tired of looking at the same old photos or paintings? Got more family pictures than you can handle? Why not use this new system. Simply load all your pictures onto this one device and you will be able to change them with ease. The photo frame 1000 comes fully equipped with many complimentary scenes such as 'sea' and 'night sky' simply say the name of the place you wish to see and photo frame 1000 will show you it in real time!\" He returned to his normal voice here \"Actually, this prototype is missing most of the scenes but I have no idea which ones. Just keep saying place names out loud to it and you'll soon figure out which ones it does. I sent Timcampy to Ron and Hermione so I have pictures of all of us loaded on to it already, though I couldn't find one of all of us together but we'll sort that soon enough- not long to go till school now! Have a great day and I'll see you soon alright?\" The recording freeze framed for a second before closing down. Harry crawled to the edge of his bed and lifted off the picture of some famous car or other that was hanging there- the Dursley's had funnily enough not re-decorated after moving Harry into Dudley's old room- and he replaced it with the blank frame. He had some fun flicking through the pictures his friends had loaded on, the entire Weasly family were there and Hermione had a picture of herself smiling shyly, holding her Hogwarts acceptance letter and her parents standing behind her, their faces proud. There was a picture of Allen and Mai at a small beach, walled in by cliffs, one meandering path twisting its way up the stone walls leading to an oddly shaped stone house at the top. Mai was in a brightly coloured summer dress and was constructing a sand fortress while Allen stood nearby trying to catch her so he could put sunscreen on her. Harry smiled watching them run around the frame as he polished off the last of the cake with relish. Not long to go now he kept on saying to comfort himself he sighed as he picked up the permission form he had received. He was going to have to do some major sucking up if he was going to get anywhere near Hogsmeade this year. He sighed wistfully and whispered 'Hogwarts' out loud. The picture of Mai and Allen disappeared to be replaced by a panoramic view of the caste and grounds. Harry crawled to the edge of his bed and lightly brushed the picture with his finger, causing it to zoom in and slowly spin. He had some fun after discovering this feature spinning the castle around at dizzying speed and zooming in on different parts, watching the giant squid lazily circle the lake and curiously following some stray owls as the winged their way across the night sky. When he had seen his fill, he whispered 'off' to the picture- it wouldn't do for the Dursley's to see it- and curled up in his bed, exhausted but completely content.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry stormed out of the house as soon as he heard Vernon's car leave<strong>(AN, Yes, I **_**know **_**that he is supposed to go fetch Marge here but let me have a little artistic licence here!)**. He powered down the pavement, his fists clenched tight as he tried to hold in his anger. He kept on going blindly till he reached his favourite spot- a low wall with an overhanging willow tree which shielded him not only from the blazing sun but also from the stares of the neighbours. He flopped down and glared at the pavement. Trust the _Dursley's _to manage to wreck his birthday quite so spectacularly. Now not only was he going to have to put up with being civil to the most vile human being ever to walk the earth but he was also going to have to pretend to be an _incurable criminal?_ It was unbearable but... Hogsmeade. He would just have to constantly remind himself of what was at stake here- he only had to put up with it for a week. He could do that right? He moaned and buried his head in his hands\n\n\"You're awfully grumpy for a birthday boy\" Said a teasing voice. Harry stood up too quickly in surprise and thumped his head on one of the branches of the tree. He emerged from its leaves rubbing his head ruefully to see Allen standing beside the tree, a broad grin on his face.\n\n\"You didn't think we would actually let you spend your birthday alone did you?\" He said, gently punching his shoulder. Harry just gawped in surprise, too shocked to form any coherent though. Before he could recover sufficiently to say anything, Mai tackle hugged him almost knocking him over \"Kiniiri!\" She cried in delight \"I want a piggy back! Did you like the present? Did the fairy come back? Have you made your wish? Are you coming to the beach- Jibo, is Kiniiri coming to the beach? Your coming to the beach Kiniiri and we will make a castle and we will go swimming and we will get ice cream\" At this point, she began speaking so quickly it was impossible to be sure if the sounds coming out of her mouth were even words any more. Harry looked in utter bemusement at Allen who looked like he was going to burst out laughing at any second\n\n\"Why are you both here? And _why_ is Mai calling me Kiniiri?\" Harry said weakly\n\n\"Well, we though- seeing as its your birthday- and Dumbledore had to come back from his negotiations in Ghana to deal with this break out business- that we would make good on our promise to visit you while we are still here in England! And Mai is calling you Kiniiri because... erm... it's like a nickname in Japanese\" Harry glared suspiciously at him\n\n\"What does it mean?\" He asked warily\n\n\"Well...aha... it sort of means pet. But in a good way!\" He said hurriedly \"Like a really great pet...\" Harry glowered at him but was unable to keep it up for very long, so glad he was to see them both.\n\n\"Anyway\" Allen said with the air of someone trying to change the conversation \"Let's get going! No time to waste!\"\n\n\"Get going where exactly\" Harry asked as he lifted Mai up onto his shoulders\n\n\"The beach of course\" Allen sang, brandishing the humungous pick nick hamper he was carrying\n\n\"But we are nowhere near the beach\" Harry protested, jogging slowly to amuse Mai who bobbed up and down on his shoulders pretending he was her horse. Allen just smirked mysteriously\n\n\"I have my ways... and this is part of your birthday treat. No charge required\" They walked up to a deserted stretch of road and Allen stopped, sticking his hand out into midair over a tangle of bushes. Harry looked from Allen's hand to him, vaguely concerned for his friends sanity when two broom rose up from the ground- Harry's own firebolt and a significantly thicker and longer broom with the word '_dustdevil'_ emblazoned across the dull wood. He rummaged around in the pick nick hamper and pulled out Harry's cloak, throwing it to him\n\n\"I may or may not have broken into your house a tiny little bit\" He said as he pulled out his own invisibility cloak- it was much thicker than Harry's and significantly less invisible but it would do the trick once they were up on the air. They ended up flying for a good half an hour as Mai insisted on going to a beach in Ireland that they had visited earlier in the summer when Dumbledore was on one of his business trips. Eventually however they landed at a small beach town called Portobello and almost as soon as they landed Harry wished he was back in the air again. The heat hit him like a sledgehammer as the sun blazed furiously down on them. If he was bad though, Allen was 100 times worse. He was sporting a black hoodie and looked like he was about to expire there and then\n\n\"What are you doing you idiot\" Harry panted \"Take that silly thing off or you'll melt!\" Allen miserably shook his head\n\n\"This is a holiday destination Harry, lots of families. I'll get chased off by the police if any of them see my scar or hair\" Harry laughed incredulously \"What, arrest you for having a scar? It's hardly a crime. Besides, you are wearing a black hoodie, I'd say that's pretty intimidating in itself!\" Allen shook his head \"It's happened to me before and I won't look intimidating, look\" He tugged the hood up to reveal two cute cat ears attached to the top \"Besides, I'll have Mai with me, wrecking any possible street cred the hoodie gains me. Come on- I don't know about you two but my plan is to dive headfirst into that sea\" And with that, he took off at a lazy run, vaulted over the wall separating the promenade from the rocky beach and scrambled his way over the rocks before literally face-planting himself into the water. Harry followed much more slowly, letting Mai down when he reached the rocks so she could go off exploring. He gingerly edged his way toward the sea, kicking his shoes and socks off, and warily dipping his toe in the water \"It's _freezing_!\" He yelped. Allen surfaced, one of the cat ears stuck damply to his head giving him an even more comical appearance \"Don't be such a baby\" He cried \"It's lovely!\" Harry edged his way slowly in before chickening out again. Eventually Allen got so bored of him overreacting that he came out of the water, ensuing an embarrassingly short chase before capturing Harry and throwing him into the water. He resurfaces gasping with the cold but laughing too. They alternated between playing explorers on the rocks, playing in the sandy playpark and having races on the go-kart track returning every ten minutes or so to re-set their thermostat by jumping into the sea so they stayed in a perpetual state of dampness. They snacked shamelessly as they went along, vowing to try every ice cream flavour the little town sold, and there were _loads_. They each got a separate flavour and swapped them all round as soon as they got bored of their own. They went pier diving too ant the other end of town- even Harry tried it, though only after Mai jumped in- because as much of a baby as he was when it came to anything that involved deep water considering his absolutely pathetic swimming skills, there was no _way_ he was going to get shown up by a five year old child eventually around 12 ish they stopped for lunch but by that time, Allen had dipped into the basket so many times it was almost empty, save a few sandwiches \"I could have sworn I brought more\" He mumbled to himself, sticking his head hopefully into the basket to check if there were any more hiding in the bottom \"Ah well, no point in letting them go to waste\" He chirped and stuffed them into his mouth as they made their way to the fish and chips. They excited, arms full of steaming hot packages (Allen had bought one of every meal to the storekeepers delight) and ate down at the beach, legs dangling over the wall as they watched Mai play make-believe on the rocks, her supper lying half-eaten and forgotten on one of the flatter rocks. Harry took the opportunity to tell Harry about Marge and her evil little hellhounds \"I just don't know if I'll be able to hold out\" He wailed miserably, stuffing a handful of chips in his mouth \"_and_ it means you won't be able to visit me. No offence or anything but she would blow a gasket if she so much as knew I _had _a friend\" Allen kicked his heels against the wall as he nicked a few of Harry's chips, hungrily eyeing up Mai's abandoned meal \"She sure sounds like a charmer\" He joked \"Maybe I should come visit. It might just scare her off\" Harry ginned at the thought but his smile faded\n\n\"Nah. If I have any hope of getting Uncle Vernon to sign my form, I had better be on my best behaviour\"\n\n\"Spoilsport\" Allen huffed \"Actually, I don't know how I feel about being your friend anymore- considering how you are an incurable criminal and all\" Harry punched him non to gently on the arm\n\n\"Shut it you\" A short wrestling match ensued, resulting in the both of them resolving the issue by dunking the other thoroughly. Once again sopping wet, they squidged their way back to the promenade with Mai bounding behind them, the pockets of her summer dress bulging with stones.\n\n\"Look Jibo!\" She squealed suddenly with excitement, tugged on Allen's dripping hoodie and pointed to a street vender selling popcorn. Allen's face lit up with joy and he let out a cry of excitement, running up and buying a huge bag of butter popcorn with extra butter before happily settling down on one of the benches as he took a huge handful before passing it to Mai and Harry.\n\n\"What's so special about popcorn?\" Harry asked, rather bemused by their reaction\n\n\"Well\" Allen mumbled around a mouthful of popcorn \"When I worked in the circuses one of my jobs was always to clean out the food stalls so I used to bring all the left over popcorn- kernels and all back. Mai and I would eat it for a treat and it was always swimming with butter because there was always so much left in the machine\" He gazed, starry eyed into the distance as he automatically stuffed another handful of popcorn into his mouth. Harry wrinkled his nose\n\n\"Sounds horrible! And way to get a cardio vascular problem\" He teased\n\n\"Well you've seen how much I eat- circuses aren't exactly overly generous with their wages so I had to take food where I could. I cleared out the toffee apple stalls too so at least I got some of my five a day\" He sighed, crumpling up the package \"We used to eat it when we were on the carousel- I could work it without the music so the ringmasters never knew and Mai and I would just go round and round till she fell asleep in my arms\" He smiled nostalgically as he watched Mai swing round and round on the playpark roundabout \"I'd half forgotten just how bad things used to be\" He said softly, half to himself \"I sometimes had to carry her everywhere with me- some of the circuses were of dubious reputation. Other times I had to leave her with different performers while I worked. I forget just how lucky we are to be safe and protected\"\n\n\"How come you worked in circuses if they were so bad? And for that matter, why did you keep switching the ones you worked in?\" Allen never talked much about his past and Harry was beyond curious- he decided he may as well take advantage of Allen being in such a sharing mood\n\n\"The Japanese people are a lot more superstitious than people here- and for that matter, people here aren't that much more accepting- but for me, the circus was the best protection and thankfully they not only have very few scruples about child labour but they also are very secretive and so were much less likely to inform the police that there was a young kid running amok with a baby. As for why I kept leaving... issues kept arising. A cruel ringmaster, an overly curios performer, poor wages... the list goes on. Circuses aren't really anything like those happy- clappy bright places of fun you see on the television. There is a much darker side to them\" He shivered slightly despite the heat and then gave a rather forced laugh\n\n\"Anyway. It's all behind me now\" He grinned widely at Harry, clearly showing the conversation was over \"How about one last dip in the sea before we get you back home. Can't have you late for your delightful Aunt now can we!\" That brought Harry back to earth with a thud and he gazed despondently out at the invitingly azure sea \"Yeah I guess your right\" He sighed. Allen shoved him gently \"Race you!\" He yelled over his shoulder as he sprinted off down to the sea\n\n\"No faaaaaair!\" Wailed Harry as he shot after him.\n\nBy the time they got back to Privet drive Harry was shivering- turns out flying very fast through the air is not a good idea when your clothes are sopping wet. He was just reflecting on how ironic it would be to catch a cold in the middle of a heatwave when Allen stopped\n\n\"We'd better get going\" he said, giving Harry a quick hug and lifting up Mai so she could give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek \"Bye bye kiniire \" She giggled, giving him another peck on the nose and petting his hair before wriggling out of Allen's arms and running off to the broom.\n\n\"I'll see you soon Harry\" Allen said, waving before he swing his cloak over him and Mai and sped off into the sky. Harry trudged slowly home and made his way up to his room, trying to mentally prepare himself for the next week of torture. He was just about to collapse onto the bed when he noticed the window was lying open and on his bed lay a neat stack of every flavour of popcorn under the sun. Allen must have bought it while Harry was trying to drag Mai away from the swing sets before they left and broken into the house again while he was making his _slow_ way back home. A small note lay beside it '_hopefully this helps you get through the next week. Chin up, old Pal'_ and scribbled in a childish scrawl beneath it was '_mAi' _then beneath that again '_Mai has just learnt to spell her own name. She thought you might like to know. See you soon!'_ Harry grinned despite hearing the car door slam out in the drive and hearing the dreaded Aunt arrive. It was only one week...\n\n\n\t28. Chapter 28\n\n**A/N-Disclaimer- This chapter is way longer than any of my others- this will _not_ become the norm. I struggled to get this written up in time but I really needed to make it this long. You'll see why. Also before you ask, still not changed my mind on the no pairings yet though I would appreciate thoughts (you'll see what I mean)**\n\n**sammi117- I know, they were really adorable in that chappy, I love writing those two together :D**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Mine too! I have complete freedom when writing her character which is fun!**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- I'm glad you liked it and I know, I would much rather someone give me a present that cost nothing but a little thought than an expensive one but still :( It's quite fun trying to come up with fun presents like that for your friends- For one of my friends birthdays, I gave her the printed pages of a section of an anime she hated along with a pack of matched and a jam jar to seal the ashes in :P **\n\n**777angeloflove- Tuh dah! An extra specially long chapter just for you!**\n\n**Coronadomontes- It's hard to answer that without giving anything away... The Millenium Earl and Voldemort will not exactly be joined forces- they are just sort of dependant on each other and neither trusts the other enough to be proper partners... it's really hard to try and explain without giving anything away! No they won't fight- as in battle- against each other but they are not exactly joined at the hip either**\n\n**B3GIN- Thanks for the feedback but my full reply will be very wordy so I'm going to PM you :)**\n\n**Guest- Not sure if you are still reading this but I decided to reply here in case you are because I can't PM you. **\n\n**1. Timcampy- There is very little explained about golems in the anime so I guess I used my artistic licence a little there, which is something I admit I have been very guilty of throughout this whole story which I do apologise for. I had to have them meet in a different context as I removed Cross from the story and I thought Allen saving his life was a good way to go because it would explain his undying loyalty **\n\n** - I had to remove him for this story to work as I could think of no other way for Allen to enter Hogwarts which unfortunately led me to having to re-write much of Allen's character and story. Allen self-trained himself which I don't see as highly unlikely because Cross actually did very little training, his main role was just to keep an eye on Allen**\n\n**3. Mai- Allen didn't trust her with anyone else partially because she had magic and he didn't know at that stage that there even was a wizarding community and he didn't trust anyone else not to do what her parents did and abandon her. Part of it was purely selfishness though as she was the one that snapped him out of his depression.**\n\n**Thank you for your constructive criticism though- I do appreciate it and I hope you are still reading :)**\n\n**Diavo- I am really glad you are enjoying this story so much! Plus yeah, I really don't like Seamus and Dean all that much :P**\n\nAllen wearily flopped down on a small single bed, wincing as he felt the bony knuckles of every spring dig into his back. He had just finished unpacking the last of the suitcases as Dumbledore had rushed away to some meeting or other as soon as they had arrived at the holiday cottage leaving Allen to deal with all of the luggage while he swaned off to solve some new crisis or other. It was something to do with a discussion on prison security as now the entire wizarding community was freaking out about the measures not being strict enough- though if you asked him, any prison that had lasted that long with only one escapee was a pretty good one, especially when you considered that it contained _every single_ wizarding criminal in the UK but whatever. Everyone was panicking so Mai and Allen had been uprooted from their cosy house on the cliff top to this tiny cottage in the middle of the countryside. Not that he didn't like the countryside- it was just that he liked the shops to be closer than a miles hike from him. Plus the bony mattress was not helping matters at all. He got up after his stomach started to complain loudly about the lack of food and with a huff of irritation pulled on his boots again, mentally preparing himself for a miles walk with heavy grocery bags. Mai scurried up to his side, sporting a pair of bright yellow wellington boots\n\n\"Where are we going Jiiibo?\" She sang, dancing energetically round him\n\n\"Shopping\" He grunted, pulling his hoodie on \"Are you sure you want to come? It's a long walk\" But Mai insisted that she could do it \"I'm _five_ now daddy\" She proclaimed proudly and set off at a fast pace as if to prove to him that such distances were a cake walk for her. Allen followed her after unearthing a rusty wheelbarrow to carry the shopping in and put a hand on her shoulder, gently steering her around so she was walking in the right direction before falling into step with her as they made their way over the rolling hills, following a path of worn grass in the hopes that it led to the town. It did eventually, and after seeing just teasing glimpses of chimney pots over the brows of the green slopes they came to a proper road which led into the surprisingly large town. Mai was very enthusiastic to begin with, loading every type of food she could lay her hands on into the cart while Allen returned most of it back to the shelf as soon as she turned her back but eventually her enthusiasm died out and she climbed into the baby seat of the trolley, pulled out her favourite fairytale book and buried her nose into it, every now and again reading out her favourite parts to Allen as he stacked the trolley full of food. He always bulk-bought his food due to the enormous quantities that he ate, filling the trolley up with sackfull's of rice, potato's and veg. One of the other reasons he was fairly bitter about having to leave Dumbledore's house was that he had to give up his jobs- he had managed to get a paper round as well as a restaurant job which he had used to buy all his food because he was unwilling to be any more in Dumbledore's debt than he already was however it was quite likely that by the end of the week he was going to have to ask for money. He scowled in irritation as he switched one of the huge boxes of cereal for a cheaper rip-off version. He was going to have to find some way to earn again because by the sound of things they were going to be here for a while. Allen loaded all the shopping bags into the wheelbarrow but before he had managed to get more than a few steps along the road, Mai spotted a sweet shop. The two of them exited a few minutes later, each carrying a small paper bag of sweets. Allen was just about to pick up the handles of the wheelbarrow again when someone walked straight into him, sending him and his shopping flying.\n\n\"Oh my gosh I am _so _sorry\" Cried a voice somewhere to his right. Allen struggled to get up, eventually untangling himself from the shopping to see a young girl lying on the ground beside him, a book clutched in her hands her face red with embarrassment\n\n\"I was reading and I just forgot to look where I was...\" her voice trailed off as she looked at him and caught a glimpse of his scar. Allen flushed darkly and ducked his head, pulling his hood back up\n\n\"It's OK, I'm not hurt\" He said standing up and restacking the shopping, giving her the chance to leave without feeling too guilty but she didn't go. Instead, she picked up the paper bag that had landed on the ground, scattering the sweets everywhere\n\n\"Ooh, strawberry bon bon's. They are my favourite! Come on, will you let me buy you another bag as an apology?\" Allen looked at her in surprise, at a loss for what to say. He stammered out something about her not needing to but she just grabbed his hand and pulled him into the shop. Allen reached down and scooped Mai up in his arms before he was dragged through the door\n\n\"Is this your sister?\" The girl asked curiously, her blue eyes smiling as she waved at Mai who shyly returned the gesture\n\n\"Ah... not really. Sort of\" She gave Allen a rather assessing look\n\n\"I shall need to hear this story! Two quarters of strawberry bon bon's please\" They wondered out of the shop with their sweets and Alexi- as Allen found out her name was- led them to a small playpark. The two of them sat side by side on the swings and Allen told her a heavily edited version of his past- that he and Mai had been in the same orphanage and that he had cared for her as a daughter and that later they had both been adopted by the same person\n\n\"So you are originally from Japan\" She said, lazily scuffing her feet off the ground, sending her swing a little higher \"Your English is good. Very good actually\" Allen smiled shyly\n\n\"Thank you. My first foster father taught me it very well, he thought it was important that I could speak it properly seeing as it is the business language of the world\" His smile faded slightly and he gazed at the ground, kicking his feet so that the swing swung in circles, the chain growing taughter and taughter until he lifted his feet and the world whirled around him till it righted itself again\n\nAlexi looked searchingly at him, her face grave too \"What happened to him?\" She asked, so softly that if he had wished to, Allen could have just pretended not to hear. He raised his eyes to her solemn face and suddenly made the decision to trust her\n\n\"He died when I was only a little older than Mai. It was my fault. I... I made a stupid decision and trusted the wrong people. He died trying to save me\" He kept his gaze fixed on his hands trying very hard not to think about what he was saying. No matter how many times he told the story, he could still feel the knife of guilt twisting in his heart and hear the echo of Mana's furious voice. He jumped with surprise when he felt Alexi's warm hand on his own as she gently clasped it\n\n\"It wasn't your fault, Allen\" She whispered, tears in her eyes\n\n\"You were too young to know what you were doing. I know how you feel though. My mother... she died last year. I... I had fought with her just before. Something stupid, not even important but I shouted at her in anger and then she died without me even apologising\" A tear slipped down her cheek \"But I know that she has forgiven me, just as your father has forgiven you\" She smiled gently at him and he smiled back too then gave a little laugh\n\n\"This is the most ridiculous first meeting ever!\" She laughed too, the tears still sparkling in her eyes\n\n\"Come on\" She said and the two of them ran off to join Mai in the play park running around with wild abandon, laughing louder and acting all the more childishly to spite the pain in their hearts. Eventually when the shadows grew long and even Mai begun to run out of energy, they reluctantly decided to go back home. Alexi hugged Allen briefly and kissed Mai on the cheek, making plans to meet them again and promising to finish her book that night so Allen could read it and see exactly why she was justified in knocking him over. They waved good bye and walked off in opposite directions, Alexi with her nose firmly back in her book and Allen trundling the wheelbarrow along with Mai curled up on the top of one of the bags of rice, half asleep.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>As it turned out, Alexi's father ran a drop in centre for homeless people and Allen was able to get a job there easily enough. The pay was pretty awful but it was better than nothing and it meant that he could work while keeping an eye on Mai. He was soon put on kitchen duty and was in charge of all the cooking which more than pleased him as working with food was almost as much fun as eating it. He helped Alexi with the cleaning and maintaining of the house between meal times as there was no one else to help out. When he asked her why there were no other workers she just shrugged sheepishly and said \"Well after mum died, dad sort of stopped coming by and the workers left soon after that. Something about '<em>if the boss can't even be bothered turning up why should we?<em>'\" She flashed him a quick grin but it was clear that she was quite upset\n\n\"How long has it just been you looking after this place\" Allen asked as he worked his way up the narrow corridor with a ragged mop that had most definitely seen better days\n\n\"Well thankfully the last worker didn't leave till a week or so ago but it's pretty obvious that they had stopped looking after the place properly long before they left. It was in a right state when I first started. I've been struggling to work my way through all the records too\" He jerked her head in the direction of the small cupboard like room that was being used to hold all the records of residents. It was supposed to be a way of figuring out who was who and how often they visited. In theory it was so that any lost person could be flagged and all the data gathered about a resident could be kept together so that if they returned after a while any allergies etc could be looked up however, it was clear that no one had been bothering to keep up with it and sheaves of paper were belching out of filing cabinets and drawers, coating the floor and seeping out into the hallway. Allen raised one eyebrow at the mess \"Do you want a hand with that\" He asked as he skipped past the area around the paper then continued mopping the rest of the corridor. Alexi looked for a minute like she might accept his offer but seemed to change her mind and shook her head \"Nah it's fine. I already know the filing system so it'll be easier for me to do it\" Allen shrugged easily\n\n\"That's fine. Now about that book you lent me...\" And they spent the rest of the chores deep in discussion about the book, ranting about the irritating characters and waxing lyrical on their favourite's, bemoaning the premature end and wishing out loud that there was a sequel. Before they realised it, they had cleaned the house from top to bottom and it was tea time already. Allen rushed off to start the pasta while Amy frantically set the tables, recruiting a willing Mai to help. Mai seemed quite star struck by Amy and took great pleasure in helping her whenever she could, carrying fistfuls of forks and knives from their cabinet to Amy so she could put them on the tables. Allen ran around the kitchen like a mad thing, throwing chopped tomatoes, stock and herbs into a separate pot to make a quick sauce while frying chicken and throwing a frozen crumble he had made earlier into the oven. He had just whipped up a simple custard and thrown it into the microwave when the first customer came in. Half falling over himself, he scooped a ladle of pasta, sauce and chicken onto a plate and thrust it over the counter to the slightly bemused man. Alexi and Mai joined him behind the counter and they soon had a little production line going with Allen piling on the pasta, Alexi ladling the sauce and chicken and Mai passing the plates over to the small queue of people. All three of them sank down to the floor in relief when the last scraped clean bowl of crumble was returned to the counter and the residents made their way to their newly cleaned rooms\n\n\"That\" panted Allen \"Was too close for comfort\" Alexi nodded wearily and Mai flopped dramatically onto the floor and pretended to snore. Allen laughed and scooped her up, cradling her like a little baby \"Aw the poor little thing\" He teased, holding her tighter when she tried to wriggle out so an all out wrestling match ensued which eventually, he let her win wailing in fake pain as she held him in an arm-lock with Alexi cheering her on. The three of them walked through town together after realising that Alexi's house was only two hills away from their holiday cottage. Allen and Mai waved goodbye to her when they reached the small house and after helping Mai change into her pyjamas and scrub her teeth, Allen collapsed on his bed, too exhausted to even notice the uncomfortable mattress before he fell into a deep sleep.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Simply keeping on top of the mess wasn't quite so difficult after the major clean up so Allen mostly cleaned while Alexi worked her way through the mountain of paperwork that had accumulated over the year. Allen was a little concerned about her though, from the sounds of things her father had more or less become a recluse since the death of her mother- locking himself in his room and refusing to come to work at all. Thankfully so far, the patrons of his charity hadn't caught on because the workers and Alexi had kept it going but as soon as school started up again, it would be impossible her to work. It was inevitable then that they would find out and shut the home down leaving her father with no means of income. Not only that though- his depression had meant that she was not only bereft of a mother but of a father too and although she seemed cheerful, Allen knew that no matter how tough she was this was difficult for her. He was doing his best to cheer her up, taking her and Mai out for walks in the countryside, allowing her to show them all the best spots for picnics and rooting through bookshops for the best reads but he got the distinct impression that there was something really bothering her. Eventually after he had finished clearing up the kitchen for the night, he forcibly took her by the arm and dragged her from her little cupboard of papers and sat her down in the now deserted dining room. He shoved a big mug of steaming tea and two chocolate cookies over to her and sat back in his chair with his arms stubbornly crossed<p>\n\n\"You are not leaving this room till you tell me what's bugging you\" He said firmly. Alexi looked slightly confused \"But there's nothing...\" Allen held his hand up, halting her mid speech and pulled out a notebook, clearing his throat importantly\n\n\"In the past four days you have: Run your fingers through your hair in frustration 20 times, Sighed in exasperation 36 times, sighed in irritation-there is a big difference in the tone of the sigh- 15 times, gazed thoughtfully into space 8 times... shall I carry on?\" A reluctant grin worked its way across her face and she leant forward, tugging the book out of his hand\n\n\"Wow, you actually _did_ write all that down\" She said, sounding somewhat impressed\n\n\"Oh fine then!\" She cried in exasperation when he fixed her with a mock serious look \"I think something bad is happening to the homeless people\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Alexi turned the make shift light she had constructed out of a torch and some string on revealing a somewhat organised mass of papers. She dug through the piles, pulling out reports and roll calls, setting them side by side<p>\n\n\"See here, this is the roll call from last year, just before... just before my dad stopped coming in to work. See all those ones I have highlighted? They are the regulars, the ones that come if not every night, at least three or four times a week and see\" She spread out the weekly roll calls for the rest of the year and on each one, the number of highlighted names grew smaller and smaller. Allen frowned as he leaned in peering closer at the lists\n\n\"It seems to drop by roughly the same number each time\" He murmured, lining them up with each other \"The first week, there was a big reduction but after that, it seems to have settled down to around two or three a week and that's not accounting for all the ones who only showed up once or twice. Have you said anything to anyone?\" Alexi shook her head dismally, sighing and running her fingers through her hair\n\n\"No one would listen to me- I mean I have no proof and to be honest with you, most people don't really care\" Allen stretched across and pulled some of the individual's files out of the bundle, flicking through their information\n\n\"So what are we thinking? Human trafficking?\" Alexi shook her head and opened her mouth to answer but at that point, Mai came into the room, sleepily trailing her teddy behind her and rubbing her eyes \"Jibo I'm bored\" She whined in an I-am-going-to-kick-off-if-I-don't-get-my-way voice\n\n\"Just a minute Mai\" Allen replied impatiently, picking up another handful of files but at that she started to cry loudly, stamping her little feet on the ground in the beginnings of a temper tantrum. Allen opened his mouth to reprimand her but Alexi put her a finger over his lips and shook her head with a small smile \"It can wait until tomorrow- there's nothing we can do this late anyway\" Allen reluctantly nodded and replaced the files into the cupboard. It took a good ten minutes to calm Mai back down again and coax her out the door so that he could make the long trek home with her wrapped up in blankets, cradled in his arms. She fell asleep long before he got back to the little cottage which was once again deserted- Dumbledore must be working late. Again. Allen awkwardly fished the keys out of his pocket and opened the door with his elbow, doing his utmost not to disturb Mai. He gently tipped her into her bed and re-adjusted the blankets around her before going into his own room. He sat down on the window seat which he had discovered was significantly more comfortable than the actual bed. Despite being physically exhausted, he couldn't sleep- his brain wouldn't shut down and he kept going over and over the list of names, wondering what had happened to them, where they were now, if they were still alive. Eventually he fell into an unsettled doze, full of large shadowy figures that disappeared as soon as he turned to face them.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen turned up at work the next say with dark bags under his eyes- a look which Alexi was also sporting. He was distracted throughout the whole morning which caused all of his jobs to take twice as much time as they normally would but eventually he cleared up the last of the breakfast plates and sat out on the small porch swing that hung from the single fruitless apple tree which filled most of the small garden as the home had no porch. Alexi joined him with the files and Mai quite happily began a game of make believe with her dolls on the withered grass. Alexi handed Allen over a small handful of the files \"This is why I don't think it could be traffickers\" She swept her short hair behind her ear and pointed to one of the papers \"See here, this person was dying from AIDS- we had been getting him medicine but...\" She shrugged her shoulders and left the sentence unfinished \"This one here, he was 54 years old and was lame in one leg and she was so mentally unwell she could hardly hold a conversation. It just makes no sense- why would they take them?\" She fixed her eyes on Allen's desperately searching for answers but he had none.<p>\n\n\"It is possible that these were opportunistic crimes and they didn't know who they were snatching but for such a careful organisation, that would make no sense. There is very little point in theorising though- we need evidence. I don't suppose you know the places that these people frequented? We could ask questions of the people there, canvas the area, maybe patrol and see if we can find any solid leads that we can bring to the police?\" he asked, his voice quick and urgent. Alexi's face lit up and she nodded enthusiastically. She ran off and dug up a map of the town, circling all the areas that she knew the homeless people gathered when they weren't in the home. They spent the rest of day writing up a plan of action- making patrol times and a list of all the items they would need. Excitement thrummed through the air as they gathered together torches, dark coloured clothes and a walkie talkie apiece complete with a list of code words. Allen left Mai in the charge of Dumbledore who thankfully was at home that night and set off to his assigned area of town, his black coat fastened right up to his throat and a black beanie pulled down over his silver hair. He settled down in a good lookout spot on the roof of an allotment garage which gave him a good view of his area while keeping him more or less invisible. For the first hour or two, he and Alexi kept to the plan and didn't speak at all over the system but after reading over the statements he had taken from the remaining residents for the tenth time, he got bored and they started to chat about everything and anything to help them pass the time. It was about four in the morning and Allen was lying flat on his stomach on the roof, viewing the street with half closed eyes as he and Alexi quoted film lines to each other across the walkie talkies \"If in doubt, always follow your nose\" He sleepily yawned into the speaker\n\nCrackling across the system came Alexi's reply \"You broke the smol... What was that!\" Allen jerked to attention, sharply pulling the device away from his ear as her yell caused a squawk of feedback \"What's happening!\" he shouted back, panicked. There was a burst of static and a few disjointed words flew through \"I just saw... huge... can't see what...\" Allen scrambled to his feet and set off at a sprint in the general direction of Alexi's area. The walkie talkie burst into life again, this time a little more clear \"Sorry, panicked. I just saw something. You're going to think I am crazy. Oh my gosh what happened to him\" She trailed off into a panicked whine, sounding like at any minute she was going to burst into tears. \"Get out of there Alexi\" Allen said, as calmly as he could, changing direction \"Go to your house, I'll meet you there and you can tell me what you saw. Just keep calm and _get out of there_\" He ran full pelt through the streets, hardly slowing for anything. All the while, terrifying thoughts swirled through his head about a mass murderer, mad axe man and every few seconds, he would call \"You ok?\" Through the walkie talkie and not relax until she replied \"I'm OK\" They kept this dialogue up until eventually he called \"You OK?\" and she tapped him on the shoulder replying \"I'm fine\" Through shuddering gasps of air. They embraced tightly and with trembling hands, she unlocked the front door. They both fell through the door as soon as it opened and she ran up stairs immediately with Allen close on her heels. She swung into her room and collapsed onto her bed wrapping her duvet tight around her trembling shoulder as she tried to calm her juddering breaths. When her breathing had eventually returned to normal, she told Allen her story\n\n\"There was a man walking down the street and he looked a bit suspicious but I didn't really think anything of it but then he sort of froze and jerked- I thought he was having a fit- but then he... he. A thing...\" She was struggling for words and was still shaking\n\n\"You won't believe me. _I _don't believe me\" Allen reached forward and gripped her shoulders tight, fixing his gaze on hers. Trepidation was building up in his mind and he had a horrible feeling that he knew exactly what she was going to say\n\n\"There was a huge monster inside him Allen, It burst out of his body and killed one of the sleeping homeless people. It was horrible. Bulbous and black with these cannons\" She shuddered and fixed her gaze on Allen \"What was it?\"\n\nAllen took a deep breath to steel himself, he was just about to tell her the truth when the front door swing open with a loud bang and his eye activated\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Alexi gave a strangled scream as the gears in Allen's eye whirred panickedly, informing him that this Akuma was like nothing he had ever faced before<p>\n\n\"What is going on, Allen! What happened to your eye?\" Allen scrambled off the bed caught between keeping Alexi calm and sprinting downstairs to save her from the Akuma\n\n\"The monster you saw is here Alexi, my eye detects those kinds of creatures. I can fight it but you _need_ to get out of here. Now!\" He grabbed her arm and pulled her out into the corridor but she pulled back gasping \"No, Dad\" she half fell into one of the other rooms crying for her father to get up and come out but there was no sound from within the room. She ran back to the door, her eyes wild \"He's not there Allen, He's not there\" He could hear the desperation in her voice and he felt a horrible sinking sensation in his stomach as he started to piece together what had happened\n\n\"Listen Alexi\" He said, his voice low and urgent \"That monster you saw, remember how it looked like a man first\" Alexi nodded her head, her lips pressed tightly together and her face stark white \"Well this creature, it can take on the appearance of humans but I can tell what it really is with my eye- your father hasn't been acting like himself for a long time now has he?\" He could see something of understanding dawn in her dark eyes\n\n\"Hey sweetheart, what are you doing up so late? And who is this?\" came a smooth voice from the bottom of the stairs. The two teenagers spun around and Allen placed himself in front of Alexi, spreading his arms out protectively\n\n\"Just tell me\" Alexi whispered, her voice trembling \"Please just tell me. Is that my Daddy\" And slowly Allen shook his head. She gave a small sob and Allen activated his arm. The face of the middle age man who stood in front of them contorted into a twisted mask of fury and bitterness \"_Exorcist\" _He hissed and the skin which the monster was wearing shuddered and rippled as it tore itself free revealing its true form. Alexi gave a soft whimper of fear, her nails digging painfully into Allen's shoulders as she clung to him. The creature that emerged was unlike any other Akuma Allen had ever seen, though there was no doubt it was an Akuma- there was the soul that he figured was Alexi's mothers, but it was twisted and tortured beyond anything he had ever seen before. His stomach turned at the very sight of it and it was all that he could do not to be sick. The Akuma itself was different- it looked almost human with a distinctive torso, legs and arms that ended in cruel talons. A huge manic grin was stretched impossibly across its face from cheek to cheek and it appeared to have no eyes\n\n\"What's wrong exorcist?\" It hissed the grin stretching even further \"You scared?\"\n\nAllen bared his teeth in anger and recklessly threw himself at the creature, hoping to gain enough time for Alexi to make it out the door but the Akuma easily side-stepped him and hit him with a blow that sent him flying. He landed hard on a coffee table, snapping it down the middle with a resounding crack. Allen was forced to throw himself recklessly back at the creature as his foolish move had left Alexi completely unprotected. The creature clawed at him, scratching shallow furrows across his chest. Allen rolled back to the foot of the stairs, his arm clutched around his stomach.\n\n\"Alexi, get out now\" He yelled, trying to ignore the burning sensation in his stomach and the horrible thought that he was in serious trouble and the Akuma didn't even seem to be trying very hard. It stood there, its head cocked to one side, the manic grin stretching its already disfigured face even more out of proportion. Alexi crept down behind Allen and made a mad dash for the door but just before she reached it, the Akuma reached out his hand and shot a bolt of what looked like liquid flames at it causing it to immediately burst into flames. Alexi yelled in shock and fell backwards onto the ground. The Akuma immediately bore down on her, its hand outstretched but before it could reach her, Allen cannoned into it side and locked it in combat, exchanging fierce blows and earning himself another long scratch on his cheek. Blood slowly trickled down his face as he wrestled with the creature trying to gain the upper hand. Flames crackled and snapped around him as they spread from the door to the furniture. The Akuma leaned close into Allen\n\n\"I am going to kill you exorcist and devour that little girl. My master will reward me richly when I return to him\" It giggled ominously \"Or perhaps I won't kill you myself, I shall let you watch me kill the girl and leave the flames to devour your pitiful body\" his laughter grew louder\n\n\"I won't let you touch her\" Allen yelled, desperately pulling on every fighting skill he had ever learnt while silently cursing himself for not bringing his wand. A good '_augmenti'_ charm would not go amiss here. The Akuma just laughed all the louder\n\n\"You think you can defeat me, you puny little child\" And he dealt Allen a dizzying blow, turned his hand palm up and shot an intense stream of flames towards Allen's innate body. He wildly twisted his body out of the way, initiating a desperate game of 'tig' with the monster only the ramifications of losing this game were much more daunting than any he had played before. The staircase behind him rushed up in flames, the heat searing his skin as he sprinted past. The air he sucked into his lungs seemed to catch his very chest on fire as it burned its way down his throat, choking him. He had to get Alexi out of there. She was curled up on the floor sheltering under one of the tables with her hoodie pulled up over her mouth and nose. Allen pulled himself up short when he reached the open plan kitchen. Using magic had obviously made him complacent- he needed to start using his brain. He plunged his arm through the kitchen unit that held the sink, gripping the water pipes in his cursed arm before wrenching them out causing a gout of water to burst from them, twisting them so that they hit the Akuma. He followed this up with an attack, using the spray of water to hide his approach but while he ran, he caught up an ugly metal statue and threw it with all his might through the window above Alexi's head and gestured wildly at her to get through it before he collided once again with the monster, wrestling him to the ground and pummelling him with his cursed arm. The Akuma just laughed and threw Allen off, seemingly unaffected by the blows\n\n\"Do you think that will stop me, puny boy? You will watch while I feast on her...\" But Allen didn't let it finish\n\n\"You will never touch a hair on her head\" he roared and he could feel something change within him, his arm rippled and changed, growing heavy and re shaping. He instinctively raised his arm and, working in perfect synchrony with his body without even realising what had happened, he sent a barrage of white bullets towards the Akuma. They collided with his torso and cut off his horrible laughter and replacing it with an inhumane screech. Allen yelled too as he channelled all his energy into the cannon his arm had given him. Finally, he cut off the stream of bullets and collapsed to his knees, coughing and chocking on the smoky air but as the smoke cleared the Akuma came forward, still standing. The manic grin was gone and instead a snarl was twisting his face \"I will tear you limb from limb you pitiful little exorcist\" It snarled as it staggered forward. Allen forced himself back to his feet and charged, knocking the creature to the ground. He let out a scream of pain as it shot a stream of hot magma at him, it caught his shoulder and set his top on fire but Allen just screwed his face up and clung all the tighter, placing his new weapon up against the monsters head\n\n\"Pitiful Akuma\" He chocked out between clenched teeth \"May. Your. Soul. Be. Saved\" and he shot.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Alexi watched as her house burned down, barely noticing the tears as they streamed down her face. She stood as close as she could bear to the blazing building, the heat of the flames evaporating the tears almost as soon as they slipped out of her eyes<p>\n\n\"Allen!\" She screamed into the flames, straining to catch a glimpse of him through the smoke. There was a deafening crack and the back half of the building shuddered as something inside collapsed, consumed by the fire. Suddenly she saw something move though the shadowy smoke. She drew back in fear- it didn't look human but as it collapsed over the sill of the window, she saw the familiar silver hair and she ran forward, sobbing in relief as she dragged her friends limp body away from the house, rolling him over and over in the grass, trying to put out the flames that were licking his shoulder. His body shuddered as he coughed and spluttered trying to get the thick smoke out of his lungs. Alexi helped him up and they both started when they heard the faint woop of a siren in the distance \"Someone must have seen the smoke and called the fire brigade\" Alexi said, nervously tugging Allen further back as the building shuddered again. Allen struggled to his feet, stumbling and almost falling over. Alexi tried to pull him back down to the grass but he staggered away shaking his head \"I have to go Alexi- I can't let them find me here. You need to lie to them, I'm sorry but you _need_ to. They will think you are insane if you tell them the truth. Just tell them that you woke up with the house on fire and you escaped through the window. Please Alexi, I can't get involved in this\" He turned in the direction of the sirens as they grew louder and looked pleadingly down at Alexi who was still clinging on to his arm \"Promise me Allen\" She said urgently, her gaze burning \"Promise you will explain everything to me\" He nodded and lent down embracing her\n\n\"I swear I will tell you everything later but I need to go now. They will lock us both up in a mental asylum if we tell them what really happened. Trust me, it's for the best\" Alexi reluctantly nodded and released her grip on Allen. He glanced worriedly down the lane before turning his back on the blazing house and limping off as fast as he could in the direction of his house just as the sun started to kiss the fields, shedding light on the scene of disaster. He held out right up till he reached the door of the cottage at which point his legs gave up on him and he crumpled in a heap on the ground, his vision flickering, showing him teasing glimpses of the door, of Dumbledore's worried face, of the narrow entrance hall and then darkness\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen wondered through the bleach white hospital, holding a sheet of paper with directions on it as he meandered from one corridor to the other, utterly convinced that he had been past this door at least twice before. Eventually, he was rescued by a kind nurse and shown into the ward Alexi was in. She was sitting up in her bed, a drip attached to her arm and a ventilator sitting beside her. Her face lit up when she saw him and he smiled at her, handing over a poorly wrapped box.<p>\n\n\"It's a little get-better-soon gift\" He said shyly. Alexi tore into it in delight and laughed when she pulled out a huge jar of strawberry bon-bon's along with a bon-bon scented candle and air freshener. At the bottom of the box, was a leather bound version of the book she had been reading when she knocked Allen off his feet with a little handwritten note inside '_sometimes good things come even from bad beginnings'_ She reached across the bed and embraced him gingerly, trying to avoid touching either of their burns before fixing him with a solemn look and saying\n\n\"OK, now it's time to explain\" Allen proceeded to tell her everything. He hadn't told Dumbledore that he was planning on doing this but he knew that it was the right thing to do- she deserved to know exactly what had happened to her father otherwise it was very possible that the Earl would appear to her and offer her the same deal he offered her father. When he had finished, there was a long silence until \"So, he is definitely dead then, my father\" Allen nodded and she pressed her lips tightly together, nodding back. She lasted almost five minutes before bursting into tears and as she sobbed, Allen held her, not even bothering to try and offer any empty consolations just saying\n\n\"Let it out, it's fine\" Eventually, the tears dried up and she sat up, drying her face. She seemed almost calm and she gave a small sad smile \"I guess he died a long time ago really\" Allen held her hand in his own and told her that he had taken care of the home, written to the charity and arranging for help to come so it would keep running. There was still a job there for her, if she could take it. Alexi nodded listlessly, only wakening from her stupor when Allen made to leave and she just whispered \"Please. Stay\" So he stayed and sat with her, stroking her hair until she fell asleep against him, her face becoming peaceful as she escaped into the beautiful world of dreams. It was with a heavy heart that Allen left the village the next week. Even with the promise to keep in contact with Alexi, he couldn't help but feel a yearning that he had never felt before- a yearning to be normal. To have a house and friends and a job with no fighting or responsibilities. With a small sigh, he hefted the last of the suitcases into the car and gazed around the small town for the last time before closing the car door behind him with a snap.\n\n\n\t29. Chapter 29\n\n**A/N**\n\n**Diavo- Thank you so much for all you kind comments :D Potions in my mind have the same effect as spells, they use the bodies resources but speed up the process or neurtalize poisons the body can't neutralise on its own but they still rely on the body's energy, otherwise the hospital wing and st Mungo's would be completely redundant**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Thnk you :) I needed to find some way for an Akuma to cover its tracks while living in a town and that seemed the best way- horrible as it is, its just true that people don't really care about the homeless so they seemed like the ones that noone would notice dissapearing**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- YAY ^^ Me too :P**\n\n**777angeloflove- Me too :/ she's a tough cookie though, she'll be fine :)**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- Don't worry, this year there will be 'the meeting' though it won't be for a wee bit yet sorry :/**\n\nAllen waved over to Hermione and Harry as they finally reached the Great Hall, gesturing to the free seats beside him and Ron. They made their way through the press to reach them as quickly as possible, both trying to ignore the stares that followed them. Malfoy had obviously been filling in as many people as physically possible about the dementor incident and Harry felt like the entire student body was judging him. They collapsed gratefully into the seats and tried to look unflustered as Dumbledore began his speech. The Great Hall was buzzing with excited chatter as the students greeted new additions to their houses and dug into the delicious food, one topic dominating all the conversations- Dementors. Allen greeted them with a smile when they finally got a chance to talk \"It's good to see you all again\" He said politely but Hermione ignored the formal greeting and threw her arms around him. Allen's eyes widened with surprise but he then relaxed into the hug, blushing faintly\n\n\"How come you lot were so late\" He asked, staring around the hall at the bustling body of teenagers, the excitement and nervous practically tangible in the air\n\n\"Woah mate, you first. What _happened _to you?\" Ron exclaimed, completely ignoring the question and staring blatantly at Allen's bandaged arm and suspiciously padded robes which he apparently hadn't noticed all throughout the sorting\n\n\"Oh, nothing really\" Allen said airily, giving Ron a meaningful look \"Had an argument with a couple of adolescent salamanders when I was helping Hagrid in the grounds\" He gave a rather pointed look to the surrounding eavesdropping students who- realising that they had been discovered- began talking loudly to each other and Ron flushed \"Sorry\" he muttered under his breath. Harry immediately became Mai's personal playground as she scrambled onto his lap without so much as a 'if you please'\n\n\"Hey Kiniiri!\" She squealed in excitement, wrapping her arms around his neck but before he could recover from the shock and greet her in return, she turned around and began playing quite contentedly with the cutlery on the table, utterly ignoring him.\n\n\"Kiniiri?\" Ron asked curiously. Harry flushed darkly\n\n\"Ah, nothing. Erm, you were asking about the train Allen?\" He shot Allen a pointed look and he took the hint, repeating his question. Thankfully Ron hardly noticed the change in topic and he began to tell an- only slightly- exaggerated recount of the events on the train. His version oddly enough left out the bit where he panicked and according to him, he had managed to wrestle with the creature before Lupin 'finished it off' without anyone else noticing which was quite a fete if you thought about it. Harry and Hermione exchanged longsuffering looks before filling Allen in on what _really_ happened. To Harry's relief, Allen didn't so much as bat an eyelid when he heard that Harry had collapsed and merely shuddered, thanking his luck stars that he hadn't been on the train. Once the noise in the hall had reached its standard close-to-deafening level, Harry repeated Ron's question/ Allen shrugged rather dismissivly and told them he'd had a rather bad run in with a pairomaniac Akuma. Harry and Ron both accepted this without much though and resumed their previous discussion about exactly how likely it was that Hagrid would set them a fire-demon as their first lesson\n\n\"You'd better watch it Allen\" Ron joked \"By the end of the year you'll have more burns than Charlie!\" Hermione however didn't join in the laughter and watched Allen closely, curiosity written all over her face\n\n\" I thought Akuma were easy enough to handle. You've never been burnt before. What changed?\"\n\nAllen squirmed uncomfortably under her scrutiny\n\n\"Really it's nothing. This one was just a little stronger than what I'm used to. It happens\" He proceeded to stuff copious amounts of every surrounding dish into his mouth to ward off any more questions. Hermione however- used to Ron as a friend- didn't let this deter her. If there was one thing she hated more than anything else it was being in the dark. And she was concerned about Allen's safety. That too...\n\n\"So can they all shoot fire\" She inquired, making it clear that she wasn't about to drop the subject \"Why have you never been burnt before?\"\n\nAllen gulped down his mouthful of food, frantically trying to think of a way to get her off his back\n\n\"This one was just different\" He said, smiling his best I-am-absolutely-fine smile\n\n\"Most can't do that but don't worry, from now on out I'm going to be much more careful. It won't happen again\"\n\nHermione narrowed her eyes, clearly not believing a word he was saying\n\n\"How come Madame Pomfrey hasn't fixed you up yet? You must've given Dumbledore quite a scare, coming home burnt to a crisp!\" Ron chipped in, grinning ear to ear at the thought of a blackened, smoking Allen arriving at Dumbledore's doorstep. Allen took a deep breath, resigning himself to answering all their questions\n\n\"Akuma are magical creatures so the normal remedies don't work and Dumbledore was worried yeah, but he's fine now\" Thankfully at this stage Hagrid came and distracted them from their cross-examination leaving Allen to recover and dwell on the unpleasant memory of exactly how Dumbledore _had_ reacted to his injuries\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"<em>...completely irresponsible and utterly foolish. What on earth do you think you were doing, putting yourself in such a dangerous position without so much as informing me? Especially considering the delicate situation we now find ourselves in- the entire wizarding community is in uproar, the authorities on high alert, watching every single suspicious event for a hint of Black's whereabouts. What were you planning on doing if they had found out you were involved in that fire? How would you have talked your way out of that?\" Dumbledore paced the floor furiously as he ranted. Allen listlessly watched him, not even bothering to try and reply. He <em>had _been stupid but most of all he was just too exhausted to even bother trying to defend himself. He only snapped out of his silence after Dumbledore suggested they wipe Alexi's memory as insurance_\n\n\"_That would not be the best approach\" He said as calmly as possible, clenching his gloved hands tightly together and doing his utmost to keep his expression calm and blasé \"So far this just looks like a house fire- if you interfere in such a large way, it would seriously increase the chances that we would be linked to it. What reason would you have to visit her? And wouldn't it be even more suspicious if she could remember nothing about the fire?\" Dumbledore conceded the point and sat down on the chair opposite Allen with a sigh. He looked drained Allen noticed sympathetically- how he managed to juggle all the responsibilities he took on despite his obvious age Allen would never understand_\n\n\"_Look, I know it is tough for you having all this on your shoulders at such a young age but you must realise, I put this pressure on you because I know you can handle it. You managed to look after that little toerag\" He gestured affectionately to the dozing Mai \"So I know that I can trust you to take care of both your educational and moral demands without letting the two clash. I am just warning you that you are going to find that much harder in the coming year. We are to have Dementors placed around the school against my express objections and we are to be watched closer than we ever have been before. I _need _to know that I can trust you to do your job discreetly and to avoid __ever getting yourself into this kind of situation again\"_\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen had solemnly sworn to follow this command to the letter with absolutely no idea as to exactly how he would pull it off. Dumbledore had informed him of a passage that led out into a small wizarding town nearby Hogwarts. It had previously been blocked but he had cleared it for Allen's use however as a precaution against anyone else using it, Allen had needed to recite a blood-vow so that only he would be able to enter it. He had also had to perfect the disillusionment charm over the remaining week of the holiday until he passed Dumbledore's inspection. It was not however getting out that troubled Allen, it was the Akuma. He had no idea what he would do if he was ever faced with a level two again. It was pure luck that he had survived the last attack and despite many attempts, he had been unable to activate his innocence to the gun-form again and without that he knew he had no chance whatsoever of so much as injuring it. He wished he had someone to explain to him why his arm had done what it had done and how he could make it do it again but unless he had plans to sign up to the black order, he would just have to puzzle through this himself. He was just going to have to do what he could, which included a strict exercise programme- he had become complacent over the past year, with comfort and safety surrounding him and he had lost many of the skills he had honed while living on the streets but he was just going to have to buckle down again and get his head back in the game. This was no time to be slacking. The next morning a surprised Harry woke up to see Allen performing press ups on a chair precariously balanced on one leg. He rubbed his eyes and blinked a few times to be sure that he wasn't still asleep<p>\n\n\"What are you doing mate?\" He asked incredulously. Allen started at the noise and the already unstable chair wobbled then skidded across the stone floor. Allen pushed off the backrest at the last moment, landing in a handstand on the floor and letting his legs down behind him so he ended up in a bridge position looking at Harry upside down\n\n\"You gave me the fright of my life\" He moaned, slowly lowering himself to the floor where he lay trying to regain his breath\n\n\"What were you doing?\" Harry repeated weakly, feeling like he had just aged a decade, watching him tumble toward the unforgiving floor\n\n\"It was just an exercise I used to do while I was in the circus\" Allen replied, getting up off the floor and straitening himself off, tugging his gloves more firmly over his hands \"Need to keep in shape\" He grinned and then his stomach let of an ungodly growl. The two boys laughed and after waking up a sleepy Ron, they made their way down to the Great Hall.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"He really is rather rude\" Allen observed as they walked past Malfoy, who was taking great pleasure out of mocking Harry. Ron and Harry both exchanged incredulous looks<p>\n\n\"Rude is the word you are going to choose to describe Malfoy?\" Ron asked, his voice indignant. He then proceeded to reel off a long list of the things you could be justified in calling Malfoy. Rude did not make the list oddly enough\n\n\"_Ron!\" _exclaimed Hermione as she caught the tail end of the conversation. Ron merely shrugged and gave her a you-know-its-true look, piling as much food as he could onto his plate before Allen could reach the table. Recovering from her indignation, Hermione started to geek-out over her new school subjects, attracting some unwanted attention to her overly crowded timetable\n\n\"Talking of school\" She said loudly over Ron's inquiries \"Isn't Mai starting school?\" Allen started at the sound of Mai's name and peered around his teetering mountain of bangers and mash, somewhat resembling a chipmunk with his cheeks stuffed full of food. He nodded in conformation as he swallowed \"Yeah, Dumbledore insisted on hiring a tutor personally. You should have seen the number of interviews we had! There were a couple brownies I really liked but Dumbledore said that they would have just spoiled her rotten and there was a fairy we contemplated for a while however her voice- gave you a splitting headache so eventually we settled on a dryad called Rhamnella. She's strict enough to keep even Mai in line. Nice though\" As soon as she heard Mai was being taught by a dryad Hermione's eyes lit up and she began to inform the definitely not even vaguely interested boys about every minute detail of their race. \"I wonder if she'd let me ask her a few questions?\" She mused out loud to no one in particular as the group made their long and winding way to the North tower, stopping frequently to try and regain their breath and bearings\n\n\"Probably best if you don't\" Allen said rolling his eyes at her back \"Don't want to disturb Mai from her studies\"\n\n\"Oh no of course not!\" Hermione exclaimed, sounding shocked that he would even suggest such a thing. The boys all smirked at each other\n\n\"Ah I give up!\" Harry moaned in desperation and turned to the nearest painting to ask directions\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Eventually the group made their slow way around the last spiral in the staircase and stood at the top, panting until they had regained their breath. Allen looked in trepidation at the trapdoor in the ceiling<p>\n\n\"What's the matter Allen? Afraid of heights\" Ron smirked\n\n\"Nah\" Allen replied glumly \"Just not a fan of fortune tellers. Dumbledore bullied me into taking this stupid subject- something about 'trying new things' and 'broadening my horizons' If I don't like this class, I am swapping strait to ancient ruins. Sounds so much more fun\" He missed the look that Harry and Ron exchanged as the ladder descended from the ceiling and slowly the whole class ascended into the perfume and pouffe filled room. Trelawney made her way around the students, airily predicting tragedies wherever she paused along the way. She passed by Allen on her way to inform Dean that he would sprain his ankle in the near future and Allen breathed a sigh of relief into his cup of tea but then\n\n\"Wait!\" Trelawney roared causing the entire class to jump and poor Neville to land on the floor for the second time. She slowly turned around, her head tilted back to the ceiling and her arms outstretched, trembling \"There is darkness, such darkness\" Her voice was harsh, quite unlike the breathy tones she had previously been using. She stopped abruptly in from of Allen and lowered her gaze to his\n\n\"Ah yes. Your curse not only fills your aura but your very appearance- you are marred by your fate. The desperate past. The hopeless battle. The dark future. And the shadow. The growing shadow. You feel it, don't you, feeding and growing and solidifying, eating at your soul. Gnawing at your very being\" Her eyes filled up her glasses as she leaned closer to the wide-eyes Allen\n\n\"Who are you?\" She hissed\n\nAllen shakily got to his feet, his face blanched but expressionless. He opened his mouth as if to say something, and the entire class watched him, the silence so heavy, it seemed to press down on him, restricting his lungs. He then turned around and left without a word, pulling open the trapdoor then letting it shut quietly behind him\n\nTrelawney started with surprise, now bereft of her centrepiece then her eyes lit up again when she saw Harry \"Let us take a look at your cup dear\" She said, a creepy grin filling her face\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen blindly strode through the school, paying no attention to where he was going and eventually choosing a door at random to walk through so that he wouldn't end up meeting Mrs Norris or Filtch along his way. The room he walked into was surprisingly huge and thankfully completely deserted. To Allen's pleasant surprise, he found it full of training devices- dummies, swords, punching bags, weights and whole cupboards overflowing with other such things. He set to it with a will, hammering his frustration out on the punch bag until the sweat poured down his face. He continued pummelling it until he heard the bell go in the back of his mind. He caught the swinging bag and lent his forehead against it, his chest heaving<p>\n\n\"Tch, call that punching?\" came an irritated voice to his left. Allen swung around with a yell of fear to see a flickering hologram instructor, looking as bored as a hologram can\n\n\"Idiot apprentice, you'll need to do much better than that\" It sneered. Allen squinted at in, waving his hand in front of its eyes- nope, definitely a hologram- it must have been left by whoever owned all this stuff. Ignoring the insults that were thrown after him, Allen picked up his bag and schooled his expression back to its usual passive state before exiting the room, taking careful note of the rooms position before making his way to Transfiguration\n\n\n\t30. Chapter 30\n\n**A/N- Quick note here- Just to tell you something you'll already have noticed- My updates are slowing, and I don't think I'm going to be able to post much faster so just a heads up, the once a week thing probably won't continue. My posts will _probably_ be either a Thursday or a Saturday but I'm just too busy to keep up the speed I had before, sorry :/**\n\n**sammi117- Nah, Allen is far too passive aggressive to actually hit anyone. Unless its Malfoy. But he doesn't count**\n\n**Guest- :D Got it in one! **\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Thank you muchly ^^ I'm really pleased your enjoying it so much! **\n\n**Diavo- I don't know, pairings are sort of danger ground for me. Might have AllenxGinny... though I quite liked the idea of AllenxLuna too. Whatever I do though there will be no Roadxanyone. This fanfic is supposed to be true to life and I refuse to believe that any of my characters would fall in love with someone so twisted... though I do like lighter fanfics that pull it off :) AllenxRoad are usually pretty cute though only after the OOC them to death**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Thank you for the feedback! I hope this chapter is a bit better that way though I do see your meaning- I think because I am writing this in chunks I lose sight of the story as a whole and forget to develop certain parts**\n\n**Origami Lotus- Maaaaaaybe. I couldn't resist it! (ps, awesome username)**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- :3 Hehe, I just had to do it!**\n\n**Coronadomontes- Thank you and... sort of. Err... for now, the Akuma will steer clear of the wizarding community. They are weak at present and are working their way through the weaker humans to become more powerful and then yes they will start attacking wizards as for Voldemort, that is a bit more complicated. Not really, he doesn't care one way or the other about exorcists but remember he is in partnership with the Earl who does so... we shall see :)**\n\n**RhiannonWolf- Ah thanks! Appologies for making you cry so much :P I slipped a little parental Allen in here for you. I totally agree, he makes a great dad...**\n\nHarry let out an audible sigh of relief when Allen entered the room and the class's stares ceased to bore into the back of his head and focused instead on the white haired boy as he made his sedate way down the classroom to sit in the empty seat beside Ron, seeming oblivious to the sensation his presence had caused. Ron shot him a rather uneasy look\n\n\"Err... are you... I mean... are you OK?\" He muttered under his breath, his whisper unusually loud in the silent classroom. Allen smiled reassuringly\n\n\"Of course I am\" He said chirpily \"Though I don't think Divination is the class for me. I might try ancient ruins, it sounds much more my style. How did the rest of the class go?\" There was an awkward silence and Harry was more grateful than he even had been before for Professor McGonagall's strictness as she swept into the classroom, effectively silencing all chatter and saving him from having to answer that question. Even though he had been on the receiving end of Trelawney's exuberant predictions, Harry couldn't help but wonder about what she had meant by her prediction about Allen. As much as he hated to admit it, there had been a grain of truth in her predictions about him, after all, he _had_ seen the Grim and as Hermione had pointed out he _did_ have someone out to kill him. He had seen something in Allen's face when she had been mouthing off, something he couldn't quite put his finger on which made him wonder what it was about her prediction that had touched him enough to make his pristine mask slip. The thing he was struggling with was what it could have been in her speech that had scared him so much- sure the whole 'devouring shadow' thing had been creepy but as to what it had actually meant he had no idea at all. He would have to ask Hermione. He was snapped out of his ponderings by Professor McGonagall's irate question and was distracted once again by the taboo that now seemed to be attached with his name\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen was making his way to Ancient Ruins to ask about switching classes when he was accosted by a rather flustered looking Hermione<p>\n\n\"Allen, I really need to talk to you\" She panted breathlessly, having sprinted up the corridor to reach him\n\n\"If this is about Divination..\" Allen started warningly but Hermione shook her head firmly\n\n\"It's not. Not really. Sort of though. Ah, come here\" She grabbed his arm and yanked him into one of the deserted classrooms, pushing him down into one of the chairs and pacing uneasily in front of him. She seemed at a loss for what to say and her naturally thick hair had expanded to about twice its usual impressive size as a result of her running her fingers through it too often. Allen was just about to ask what was bothering her when she ceased her frantic marching and faced him square on, her eyes alight with a rather frightening fire. Allen shrunk back slightly in his chair and prepared himself for the worst\n\n\"You need to _swear _on your life that you won't mention a word of what I am about to tell you to anyone else and I mean _anyone_. Not Harry, not Ron, not Mai. _Do you understand?\" _She said suddenly, fixing him with a look that Professor McGonagall would have been proud of. Allen nodded his head vigorously and tried to look as serious and not-creeped-out as he could. Hermione however seemed unconvinced\n\n\"My entire school career depends on you being able to keep this secret Allen\" She growled \"If you mess this up for me, so help me I will use every jinx and curse I know on you all at once\" Allen shrunk back even further and gulped- Hermione may not be a very violent person but he knew that when school and work came into the equation, all of her ethics went out the window. He didn't even want to contemplate the terrible fate that awaited him if he inadvertently exposed whatever deep dark secret she had so he shook his head with equal vigour, waving his hands in front of himself\n\n\"I won't breathe a word, I swear\" He laughed nervously, his mind racing through all the possibilities- Hermione: Leader of a Honeydukes smuggling band, Hermione: Chief of after hours library club, Hermione: Co-conspirator of NEWT textbook-napping. He was not disappointed however as Hermione told him all about the time turner and exactly why it was that she was going to be at ancient ruins at the same time she was at Divination and at the same time she was at Muggle studies .\n\nThere was a long silence after she had finished speaking where Allen said nothing and just sort of sat there in a dazed silence\n\n\"So there is magic out there that... turns back time\" He murmured, almost too quiet to hear. Hermione looked at him funny. There was an odd tone in his voice, almost longing? He didn't seem to even remember that she was there and just stared into space, a small smile on his face and a glazed look about him\n\n\"Allen?\" Hermione said timidly after a few minutes had passed and he didn't appear to be snapping out of it any time soon. Allen jumped slightly and seemed to come back to Earth\n\n\"Why didn't Dumbledore use that to turn back time and kill Voldemort?\" He asked suddenly and Hermione started at the odd question. She got the impression that she was treading on dangerous ground and there was something in Allen's face that was frightening her slightly. She inadvertently reached up to clutch the necklace as she answered\n\n\"It doesn't work like that Allen- Voldemort's existence is too key a thing to change. If Dumbledore did go back in time to the opportune moment and killed Voldemort then the entire world would change and the set of situations that led to him going back in time would not come to pass and would therefore nullify the action- theoretically that is. The ministry are too frightened of the idea of a time warp to test whether doing something like that would cause the world would end or the action to become un-done. Besides all that, you can only go back one day and even then you can only do so once. The stone this magic was derived from shatters as soon as you do so and there are very few in existence so I won't be attempting it any time soon\" She frowned in concern as a shadow passed over Allen's face \"Why?\" She asked simply, watching him closely but he just shook his head and smiled, his cheerful demeanour firmly back in place\n\n\"It doesn't matter, I was just curious. Trust you Hermione to break the laws of time itself so that you could go to more classes! Just let me know if there is anything I can do to help you alright? You are going to have a lot on your plate, with three times as many subjects as the rest of us\" He laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder\n\n\"I won't say anything. I promise\" and with that he left, the door swinging shut behind him. Hermione followed more slowly, still not completely sure of what had just happened and more than a little concerned about her friend\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Lavi slowly edged his way along one of the long winding passageways, carefully placing each foot as he slipped through one of the doors that was lying slightly open. A huge grin split his face as he spotted his prey- Kanda was sitting in the middle of the floor meditating or whatever. Honestly, that guy needed to get a life! He spent his life either fighting, meditating or eating that disgusting soba of his. He needed someone to snap him out of the rut he had gotten himself into and to teach him how to have fun. Thankfully, Lavi knew the very person. Him!<p>\n\n\"YUU!\" He yelled joyfully, throwing himself at Kanda, his arms outstretched in full glomph-position however somehow Kanda reacted in time and leapt out of the way so that he stood scornfully over Lavi's crumpled body\n\n\"Tch Baka usage\" He scoffed prodding Lavi's twitching body with his foot \"How you have survived this long I will never understand\" He turned to stalk superiorly away but Lavi clung to his ankle wailing like a spoilt child\n\n\"But Yuu! I'm _so bored!_ Spar with me. Oh please, oh please, oh please...\" Kanda looked down his nose in disgust at the dramatic performance Lavi was giving and stomped his other foot in his face, cutting off his incessant pleadings\n\n\"I wouldn't waste my time or energy\" He growled, tugging his foot away but Lavi just clung tighter\n\n\"But YUU! \" He whined even louder causing Kanda's eyebrow to twitch with irritation \"I wanna fight! No fair, you always spar but you never let me join in and I'm bored! Spar with me. Oh please, oh please!\" Kanda let out an inarticulate growl of anger and unsheathed Mugen however before he had the chance to carve Lavi into bunny-shaped mincemeat, Lenalee walked through the door carrying a tray with steaming mugs of coffee. She stopped short as soon as she saw the two- Lavi wrapped around one of Kanda's legs snivelling and Kanda holding Mugen within a hairsbreadth of Lavi's neck. The both of them froze as soon as they saw her though their reactions were slightly different. Lavi unravelled himself from Kanda and was by Lenalee in a flash, his trademark grin back in place. Kanda merely tsked in annoyance at being deprived of a good chance to put that babyish bunny rabbit in its place and sheathed Mugen with more than a little reluctance. Lenalee put the tray down and looked from one to the other, hands on hips and a no-nonsense look on her face\n\n\"What's going on here\" She said warningly. Lavi adopted a pout and puppy eyes\n\n\"I wanted to go spar with Kanda and he wouldn't let me! Make him Lenalee\" He directed his pleading gaze in her direction and went down on his knees. Lenalee tried- and failed- to hide a smile at his antics and looked at Kanda who was staring stubbornly at the corner of the room avoiding her eyes and shifting his weight almost impercevably from one foot to the other in what could almost be described as nervousness. Lenalee's smile softened slightly as she noticed this and she decided not to push him\n\n\"Lavi\" She said in a placatory tone \"You can train with me as soon as I get this coffee to my brother OK? Let Kanda be for now- you'll just end up killing each other if you insist on irritating each other\" Kanda let out a snort at this as if to say 'you think there is even the slightest chance that he could so much as injure me' Lenalee shook her head. It was not a good sign that she could interpret Kanda's many inarticulate grunts of irritation to such accuracy. Lavi wasn't too pleased with her decision either\n\n\"But I wanna spar with _Yuu!\" _He wailed, pouting moodily\n\n\"DON'T CALL ME THAT\" roared Kanda, his patience snapping and Mugen practically flying to his hand though he didn't attack despite the murderous glare he was now fixing on the cowering Lavi who was grinning cheekily from behind Lenalee\n\n\"Kanda, put the sword away\" Lenalee said wearily and then she turned to Lavi, smiling sweetly\n\n\"I'll see you on the training field in five minutes OK?\" Lavi missed the current of warning beneath the sugary sweetness and opened his mouth to protest but before he could get a word out, Lenalee's leg twitched warningly \"O. Kay?\" she repeated through slightly clenched teeth. Lavi gulped and nodded obediently\n\n\"Brilliant\" She chirped and picked up the tray again, stalking out of the room. Kanda smirked at Lavi who sunk down on the floor in relief at his close escape\n\n\"She would use her Innocence even for that?\" He whimpered in disbelief. Kanda snorted again and picked up Mugen who had been returned once again to his sheath before stalking out of the room and heading to the training ground with Lavi's wails echoing behind him\n\n\"No fair! You were going to go spar anyway!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen half-ran half-walked along the school corridors, clutching two cupcakes- a treat for him and Mai- in his hands and desperately hoping that he wouldn't run into Filch or Mrs Norris along the way. He sighed in relief when he finally reached the hospital wing and he slipped through into Mai's nursery, waving to Madame Pomfrey as he passed. Mai was already in her pyjamas, sitting in the middle of a circle of toys who were being lectured on their table manners. Allen crept up beside her and tapped her on the shoulder<p>\n\n\"Can I join the tea party? I know I'm late but I brought cupcakes\" Mai let out a squeal of joy and jumped up to hug him before relieving him of one of the cupcakes and delving into it with pleasure. Allen felt his heart lighten once again as she told him all about what she had learned that day (she could count all the way to ten without making a single mistake!) and informing him about the behaviour of all her toys through the tea party (Mr Mistoffelees had spilt tea all down his front and was being forced to sit in the naughty corner). Her excited chatter filled up the silence and her eyes lit up with excitement until all at once her energy ran out and she stopped mid-flow, yawned and help out her arms in a silent demand to be put to bed. Allen chuckled in amusement and gently picked her up, kissing the crown of her head and lowering her into her cot-bed\n\n\"How about we go and visit Hagrid this weekend?\" He said, smoothing the hair out of her face \"He's had a tough week and I think it'd be nice to cheer him up\" Mai snuggled down into her bed and sleepily replied\n\n\"Can't. Ella's taking me on a nature walk to count real live things\" It took Allen a few seconds to make the connection between 'Ella' and 'Rhamnella'\n\n\"Ah that's ok\" He said, slightly taken aback but his reply was lost on Mai as she was already fast asleep. He reached over and lit her bedside lamp before turning of the main light and exiting the room. He walked back to his dorm feeling a little wrong-footed without really being able to put his finger on why- It hadn't bothered him when Madame Pomfrey had looked after Mai so why was this bothering him now? He shook his head, putting it down to the exhausting day he had been through and firmly told himself to stop being so petty, however sleep did not come easily that night and when it came, his dreams were restless and confusing.\n\n\n\t31. Chapter 31\n\n**A/N- I warned you :) Yeah, it took longer than even I thought to write this up- I had the chapter in my head for weeks but life has been busy :P Enough of my excuses. Enjoy, and apologies but I think you may need to get used to late updates!**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- I'm glad I am managing to make things make a little bit of sense now :) I know I am developing the plot pretty slowly but ,hey! All the more time for suspense to build, am I right! I think this may turn out to be the longest fanfic in history :S**\n\n**Raychaell Dionzeros- Please don't stop with the compliments! They keep me going :P I'm really glad you are enjoying this :D**\n\n**Diavo- Thanks, the time turner thing was a little awkward. Sorry for my slip of tongue- that was quite arrogant actually, when I said my characters, I really ment JK Rowling and Hoshino. I love fanfics that use Road pairings like I said but I am writing this fanfic as a (relatively) serious story that is supposed to be fairly true to human nature etc and there is no way that in 'real life' any of the good characters would actually fall for someone who enjoys causing suffering as much as Road**\n\n** -Nah, its just the 14th. I'm sticking at least vaguely to the actual plot :)**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Thanks, I'm glad I was able to improve on that chapter. I am going to try and have the Black Order in a little more from here on out because (not to drop any hints) during this school year there will be a slight clash of the worlds. We have just been covering child development on my course so I couldn't help but slip a little of it into my story :P**\n\n**B3GIN- Ta muchly XD and yup, that bit is going to be importaint, but mainly it just acts as an introduction to the 14th who may or may not rear his head at some point this year...**\n\nSteam rose in neat, uniform spirals from Allen's cauldron as he happily busied himself with heating his scorpion paste to precisely the right temperature, frowning in concentration as he carefully controlled the small flame beneath the mortar. He swiftly lifted it off as it reached the optimum heat and was about to scoop it into his cauldron when\n\n\"Sir! I can't heat my scorpion paste properly- you know, due to my injury\" came the obnoxious call from behind him. Allen froze mid-scoop and shrunk down, hoping to avoid Snape's eye but\n\n\"Allen, give Malfoy yours\" Came the bored reply. Allen's shoulders slumped and he growled in irritation at Malfoy's smug laugh\n\nHarry glanced up from his own cauldron which had a mini-hurricane of smoke rising from its surface due to Malfoy using his ingredients and messing up his timing. He looked empathetically over at his friend. Allen's fringe of snowy hair was shadowing his eyes and he had that same freaky expression he had worn while pilfering all of Ron's sweets in that poker game\n\n\"Sure thing\" Allen said chirpily, handing over his perfectly heated paste, a polite smile on his face\n\n\"Be sure to ass it quickly so it doesn't cool down\" and with that he turned back to his station and began to heat his replacement paste. Malfoy looked about as confused as Harry felt, but with a shrug he added the paste to his potion. Harry turned back to his cauldron, a small smile on his face. He had a vague suspicion that things were about to get very interesting. Mere moments later- in the middle of Malfoy's rant at Harry- things did get very interesting. He had just reached the \"You really don't know do you?\" part of the rant when his voice started to get higher. He paused, looking puzzled and sat back down in his seat (he had been leaning over his cauldron to hold the conversation)\n\n\"You 'right, Malfoy?\" Crabbe mumbled. Malfoy shot his a glare\n\n\"of course I...\" he clapped his hand over his mouth, flushing bright red. His voice had reached the pitch of a young girls. Crabbe looked in confusion at his friend\n\n\"You 'right, Malfoy?\" He repeated, more slowly. Malfoy's glare this time was directed at Allen\n\n\"What did you do?\" He shrilled indignantly, sounding somewhat like an irritated pixie.\n\n\"Who, me?\" Allen inquired innocently, his eyes huge \"I didn't do anything. It's nothing to be ashamed of Malfoy, this is probably just the after effect of your fright earlier. There's no need to be scared, you're safe here and if Buckbeak does break into the school intending to kill you, you don't need to worry- Harry here seems to have a knack for taming dangerous animals. I'm sure he'll protect you\" By some miracle, he managed to keep his innocent poker face in place through this whole speech. Ron and Harry weren't so strong and by this stage were doubled over, laughing so hard tears were trickling down their cheeks, even Hermione was struggling to keep a straight face and the nearby Gryffindors were also taking great pleasure in Malfoy finally getting a taste of his own medicine. Unfortunately at this stage, Snape realised Malfoy was being teased by the students- not the other way around and decided to intervene sweeping across the classroom, his black cloak billowing in his wake.\n\n\"What is going on here?\" He demanded his voice icy cold. Harry and Ron swiftly gathered their wits\n\n\"I don't think Malfoy is feeling very well sir\" Harry said, his voice trembling slightly with suppressed laughter. Thankfully Snape was too concerned with Malfoy to notice and he lent over his cauldron, poking at the contents and taking a quick sniff of the liquid before jerking his head back\n\n\"You put magnolia essence in here\" He snapped in irritation \"You've turned the potion into a voice modifier. You'll need to wait behind so I can make a remedy. Class dismissed\" With a flurry of activity, the class packed up as swiftly as possible before Snape could change his mind or find some excuse to take points of Gryffindor to make up for his favourite students 'mistake'. Allen, Ron and Harry led the class out the classroom, not even pausing to put their books into their bags so great was their hurry to escape the dank dungeon before collapsing in a heap on the grass just outside the school and bursting into hysterical giggles.\n\n\"That was you, wasn't it Allen\" Harry said when he eventually recovered. Allen tried unsuccessfully to put his poker face back on \"No\" He snorted unconvincingly before laughing and saying \"Well maybe. A little. He deserved it!\" Harry and Ron nodded in agreement but Hermione shot him a disapproving look\n\n\"You shouldn't sink to his level Allen- who knows what adding strange ingredients to his potion could have done. You're lucky it didn't have any serious effects\" All three boys stared at her in silence\n\n\"But it was pretty funny right?\" Allen said breaking the long pause in conversation, a huge childish grin on his face. Hermione bit her lip and looked away\n\n\"Ok, fine, it was a _little_ funny\" She said reluctantly and all three boys cheered\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"I wonder what he meant though\" Harry said thoughtfully as the group made their way back into school for the next class \"why would I want to go looking for a raving mad psychopath who probably wants to murder me in cold blood?\" Allen and Ron both shrugged unhelpfully and as one unit the boys turned to Hermione for a psycho-analysis on Malfoy's behaviour but she wasn't there. They all exchanged confused looks<p>\n\n\"She was right there\" Ron said and Allen immediately understood what had happened\n\n\"Oh, I think I saw her drop a book or something\" He said suddenly and to his relief, she came round the corner, seconds later lugging an over-full bag after her which promptly gave up the ghost, its contents spilling all over the ground. Allen told the two boys to go ahead and he stooped down to help Hermione pick up all her books. He gave her a small smile and raised a questioning brown. She shook her head wearily \"I know, I know. Professor Vector ran on later than usual today. I sprinted down the corridor but I just didn't manage to catch up in time\" She ran her fingers through her hair and Allen couldn't help but note her pale complexion \"Hermione, don't you think you are maybe taking on a bit too much\" He asked tentatively. She shot him a glare so heated he was incredibly glad that she had an armful of books and therefore was incapable of violence\n\n\"Okay, okay\" He cried hurriedly, grinning from ear to ear \"Taboo subject. I get it. We'd better hurry or we'll be late to defence against the dark arts\" Hermione's death-glare softened slightly at the mention of class and she nodded, both of them picking up their pace so they were half-running along the corridor\n\n* * *\n\n><p>They thankfully managed to reach the classroom in time though they didn't get much of a chance to regain their breath before Lupin had them marching through the school on a mystery errand. Malfoy was back in the class clearly having being fixed by Snape though he looked absolutely furious and was even more spiteful than usual, sneering every time Lupin opened his mouth and whispering snide comments to his faithful bodyguards who obediently chuckled each time. As soon as Allen entered the room however his expression changed to one of pure loathing and he ceased his attention on Lupin, switching his glare to Allen who reciprocated the gesture with a cheery grin and wave. Hermione shot him a disapproving glare \"Don't antagonise him\" She hissed under her breath but Allen just shrugged \"I was being <em>nice<em>\" He insisted innocently. When their assignment was eventually explained to them the class stood in silence, all concentrating on one thought: What was it that scared them most in the whole world. Allen lent against the classroom wall, his head ducked and his eyes closed as he tried to think of what it was that scared him and for some strange reason, it was much harder than he thought it would be. When he thought of the Akuma, he thought of pity, pity and revulsion. Although it was true that fighting them was scary, they themselves did not frighten him. Even the Millennium Earl brought along feelings of fury and disgust rather than fear per se. As he sifted through all the horrific experiences he had been through, his thoughts strayed to Mana before he could reign them back in and all of a sudden there was an intense lack of air in the classroom as his memory flooded back without warning, each image, each word as clear and cutting as they had been on the day itself. The grave stone, the skeleton, the Earl. Empty promises and the twisted truth \"_Curse you Allen\" _The scream of Mana rang through his ears. He raised his trembling cursed hand to his scar- the only remaining link he had to the first person ever to love him. There was a flurry of activity in the class and with a jerk, Allen snapped out of his trance. Thankfully, the entire class had been concentrating on their fears also so no one seemed to have noticed his reaction however as they gathered around the wardrobe to watch Neville's attempt, Malfoy shot Allen an oddly triumphant look\n\n* * *\n\n><p>There was a loud crack and Lupin's boggart became a cockroach but before the next student could take their place, Malfoy snuck up behind Allen giving him an almighty shove and throwing him into the path of the Boggart. The cockroach turned slowly to face him and all the room seemed to fall completely silent. For what seemed like an age, nothing happened and the two just stood facing each other, Allen pale faced and trembling ever so slightly, the cockroach frozen and flickering every now and again like an old TV. An almighty hush had fallen on the classroom as every student waited with baited breath to see what form the Boggart would take for the most mysterious member of the class. With a sudden rush, the Boggart changed, seeming to melt, spreading all over the classroom to the very walls before solidifying. Screams of horror rang through the class as they noticed what they now appeared to be standing in. Bodies lined the staff room, piled high. Harry's stomach jolted unpleasantly when he noticed his own corpse, accurate right down to the red scar and slightly askew glasses. Hermione and Ron lay there too, in the circle of bodies closest to Allen along with a girl he had never seen before with deep green hair and most disturbing of all, the small form of Mai, tiny in death. To his surprise, he even saw the body of Malfoy, somewhere off the edge of the classroom. Malfoy had spotted this too and the triumphant look had been replaced by one of fear. Allen stood in the only clear area of the class, his wand limp by his side as he gazed around the scene of devastation. All of a sudden there was movement and some grotesque shape moved across the room- a fat clownish man with a leering grin stretched impossibly across the majority of his face \"You have failed them Allen, failed every one. You can bring them back you know. Just call their names, just call them. Call them back from your detestable God. Call them Allen\" There were cries of terror around the whole classroom and the scene solidified even further, the Boggart clearly taking energy from their fear. Allen turned to face this new monster, his face blank and empty of all emotion. The perfect poker face<p>\n\n\"You think\" He said, his voice quiet but powerful \"You think I fear you?\" He raised his wand, his hair shadowing his eyes and a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth \"I. Do. Not. _Riddikulus!\"_ and with a deafening crack, the twisted scene dissolved, and the smoky tendrils of the monster twisted into a small circus dog which stood on its hind legs and balanced a red ball on its nose however no gale of laughter swept over the classroom this time and Lupin, pale faced, forced the Boggart back into the box. He drew a deep breath\n\n\"Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for being so brave as to take part in my assignment. You have all done well . Very well. 10 points to everyone who tackled the Boggart and five points to Harry and Hermione for answering my questions\" His matter of fact approach seemed to calm the class back down as their world returned to normal and as they filed out of the classroom, they were all chatting again, laughing and joking about each of their Boggarts but before Allen could slip out of the classroom Lupin called out for him to remain behind. Harry and Hermione exchanged concerned looks but had no option but to leave. Harry's heart was still thumping from the disturbing scene and he just couldn't quite wrap his head around what had happened. Why had the Boggart taken so long to change? Why had Allen's been so much larger and more detailed than any of the others and why had he not been... well... frightened of it? And deep down there was the more selfish question. Why had Lupin not allowed him to face the monster himself\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen stood awkwardly in the middle of the classroom as Lupin gathered up his things and set the staff room back to its usual state. He shot Allen a friendly smile, handing him a pile of papers<p>\n\n\"Would you mind giving me a hand with taking this down to my office\" He asked mildly. Allen nodded, slightly taken aback as he followed the teacher through the school to his own room. Lupin relieved Allen of his burden and gestured to one of the seats, busying himself with making a pot of tea\n\n\"You don't need to worry\" Lupin said kindly as he delved into one of his cupboards, bringing out a handful of Honeyduke's chocolate bars \"I'm not going to ask you for an explanation of your Boggart. I would never presume to ask such a personal question. I just want to make sure you are ok. You seem to have perfected a marvellous poker face but no matter how strong you are, that will have shaken you and the best cure I have found for that is chocolate\" and with a smile, he handed over the chocolate bars and poured them both mugs of tea. Allen rather warily accepted the chocolate but his stomach wouldn't let him be too tentative, letting out an almighty growl. Lupin laughed and Allen couldn't help but chuckle slightly too, blushing\n\n\"It's fine Allen. I have been told you have a tremendous appetite. Dig in\" Lupin said and Allen needed no second invitation, digging into the chocolaty goodness with gusto. Lupin ended up returning to his stash three or four times before Allen was finally sated but eventually he sat back, refilling his mug with tea and sighing with relief\n\n\"Better?\" Lupin inquired, his face slightly amused at the mound of wrappers that had formed on his desk. Allen nodded with a small laugh and took a large gulp of tea, steeling himself for his question\n\n\"Sir, why... Why was my Boggart different?\" He kept his gaze fixed on his tea stubbornly as he asked and he heard Lupin suck in a breath. There was a long pause and then\n\n\"It is impossible to say exactly why certain people have certain Boggarts, especially as they change depending on the mood of said person but I can take a good guess if you would like\" Allen nodded silently\n\n\"Well, it is obvious that you haven't had an easy childhood. You have clearly seen much more suffering than your average adult which changes the way you approach the emotion of fear. See, for children and many adults who have never seen the true nature of the world, they concentrate all their emotions of fear on one thing, say a spider, or snake and while other things may also scare them, that becomes the embodiment of their fear. For those who have seen more of the world, they realise that there are many more abstract things to fear and they stop concentrating all their fear on one object and instead fear... well, _fear. _I take it you have not met a dementor yet?\" Allen shook his head\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't advise that you do so but if you ever had, that would be the form your Boggart would take. As you had never met one before, the Boggart struggled to come up with a form as _fear_ itself isn't really a solid thing. That is why it paused so long and flickered. The form it eventually took was a scenario it thought would induce fear in you. Clearly, it failed to effectively terrify you but your classmates were so frightened that it had enough strength to complete the transformation\" Allen nodded his head. It made sense that the Boggart had thought the scenario would have caused him to fear- it was true that he feared failing those he loved most however the scene had not been him failing, but him having failed and so brought only sorrow to his heart. He stood up suddenly, wanting nothing more than to be out of the room and into the open air, with a chance to clear his head. Lupin stood up too and walked him to the door, handing him another chocolate bar before they parted\n\n\"Listen Allen, I am sorry you were put into such a difficult situation in my classroom and I know I am probably the last person you want to listen to right now but I am a teacher so you have little choice. You have obviously had a hard life and have suffered much but remember, there are those who care about you now. Your friends are worried about you. Go to them. It is not weakness to rely on others. Trust me, I was once in your place- so frightened to trust anyone but myself but eventually I let my guard down and I have never regretted it\" He gently lay a hand on Allen's shoulder \"Let them help you\" He said kindly and with that, returned to his office. Allen stood for a while, clutching the chocolate bar in his hand before slowly turning away from the staircase leading to the secret passage and toward the one leading to the dorm. As he walked, he steps became quicker and more sure as his heart lightened just at the thought of seeing his friends once more\n\n\n\t32. Chapter 32\n\n**A/N So yeah... hey strangers :S I shall spare you the details but suffice to say I sincerely dislike viruses and slow repair men :/ still. Here you are :)**\n\n**Also. The spelling will be atrocious- Don't say I didn't warn you. I typed this on my ipod which atocorrects like there is no tomorrow**\n\n**EpikalStorms- Thank you :D And I know... I love cuteness :)**\n\n**Akuma Lee Crimson- Yeah, I like Lupin in this book. Not so much in the other ones, but in this one at least he is rational and kind :P**\n\n**Raychael Dionzeros- Amen!**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Thanks, I was a bit dubious about it but I think it turned out OK**\n\n**Nekogami Bastet- Thanks, I did have to think long and hard about that scene but there was no way I was going to just pass over such a big bit in the story because I was struggling to find an appropriate Allen-response to it XD**\n\n**Not-Your-Buiness- No nead for death threats! I shall not hiatus, promise! And if I do, you may hunt me down with pitchforks and fire ;)**\n\n** - :D Maybe. Maybe not. Read on to find out... hehehe**\n\n**I-Love-Chocolate- First things first, ME TOO! Secondly awww, I didn't think about that. I quite like making all her nicknames Japanese, that one must've slipped through the net :P**\n\n**Guest- ME TOOOOOOOOOO**\n\n**coronodomontes- Well, the way I have thought it out so far, Allen will be more important to the wizarding battle than Harry will be to the Millenium battle which, in retrospect, isn't exactly fair. I may try to jig that about a bit and see what I can do about that... hmm... we shall see :)**\n\n**Guest- I did not know that at all! Where does it say that! I'm guessing I skipped over that bit in the manga or something... thanks for telling me!**\n\nKanda concentrated hard on breathing deeply and emptying his mind of all thoughts to do with that stupid usagi he didn't trust that little bookman at all- why did he constantly ask such pointless questions? He must have some evil ulterior motive. After all, his special ability was recording so he was probably using some psycho babble thing to get battle information by asking questions like \" how are you?\" and \"what are you having to eat?\" plus all those times he had tried to make Kanda spar with him- he was probably trying to find his weaknesses and learn all his secret moves. Kanda clenched his fist in anger. That was definitely what he was up to! Next time he saw that Baka usagi, he was going to smash his obnoxious little face in! Unfortunately, Lenalee had taken a liking to the little fool for some unknown reason. He would have to wait for some time when she was not around to exact his revenge. Lenalee was not to be messed with- although he could easily defeat her if he wanted to, he didn't want to upset her. When she was upset she did some thing with her eyes that gave him a fun y feeling in his stomach and he didn't like it. It must be a special skill that came along with 'dark boots'. Plus when's he was sad, the whole order got depressed and everyone became even more useless than they were usually which was just plain frustrating. A harsh scraping sound broke into his reviver and soft, light footfalls made their way to the spot beside him. That confirmed it, it must be Lenalee- only she would be foolish enough to interrupt his meditation and then sit anywhere within reach of Mugen. He cracked one eye open just to check and sure enough, Lenalee was sitting there in the standard meditation position, frowning slightly , her brow furrowed with worry. She must have felt his gaze on her because she opened her eyes too and met his gaze, smiling apologetically  \n>\"Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you\" she whispered. Unable to think of the socially acceptable response to this, he just tsked softly and closed his eyes again hoping she didn't think he was worried about her or that he had noticed her dull, slightly swollen eyes or the worry marks on her pale face or the way she was twisting her fingers in her lap or e fact that this was the first time she had ever even attempted to meditate<br>\"Am I annoying you Kanda.\" She asked timidly. His eyes snapped open at the out-of-the-blue question  \n>\"Huh.\" He said inarticulately<br>\"It's just you look rather... Upset\" she ventured, her big, sad eyes wide open and full of concern  \n>\"I'm fine\" he snapped and silence fell again. It wasn't that he was worried for her or anything- it was just that... As a soldier born and bred to do battle, he had no motive other than his orders to fight but if he was ever to be like one of the many other common soldiers who relied on other things to drive them in battle- if he was ever to be that weak minded and to sink to that level... He would fight for the hope that one day his actions on the battle field would help to bring about a world in which the light of hope and joy in her eyes would never have cause to dim or fade<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Kanda marched purposefully down the corridor with one thought filling his mind. Soba. He hadn't noticed the time passing in his meditation until Lenalee rose to leave,snapping him out of his trance and he very quickly became aware of the fact that he hadn't eaten anything since dinner the day before. He was in the middle of fantasising about a huge bowl of steaming soba when he heard the one sound that he hated most in the whole world- hurried footsteps and he didn't even need the following exclamation to identify his stalker<br>\"Yuuuu!\" The Baka Usagi squeeled. Without even turning, Kanda sidestepped the glomph that he knew was coming and allowed himself a satisfied smile as Lavi face-planted into the unforgiving stone floor  \n>\"Yuu, that was mean!\" He whinged, sitting up and rubbing the lump that was now forming on his forehead<br>\"Don't CALL me that, Baka Usagi!\" Kanda snarled as Mugen leapt from its sheath to Lavi's neck, almost completely of its own accord. It was a testament to Kanda's self-restraint that he didn't finish the blow. Why did that idiot rabbit have to be an exorcist? It was so frustrating! If he had just been a finder, Kanda wouldn't have thought twice about severing his head from his neck but no, that idiot just had to be an accommodator for innocence. If he didn't k ow better, he would say that the idiot had done it just to irritate him  \n>\"Aw don't be so grumpy Yuu!\" Lavi sang, either oblivious to or uncaring of the black flames and tick mark that Kanda had developed<br>\"We have guests today- you need to make a good impression and be welcoming, not a moody she-man samurai\"  \n>Kanda hesitated for a split second, momentarily torn between mild curiosity and blinding fury. It didn't take too long for his better judgement to win out. Lavi was booted with tremendous force half way down the corridor and a very irritated Kanda stormed past his innate, twitching body on his way to the dining hall. Unfortunately the idiot seemed to have quite amazing powers of recovery paired with an inability to learn for his mistakes and he trotted up behind Kanda, grinning widely as he answered the unasked question<br>\"Rouvelier has come on a spot check to see how we are settling in here. He brought cakes. Isn't that sweet of him?\" He deadpanned. Kanda's jaw tensed ever so slightly at the mention of that man's name but other than that, he didn't react at all  \n>\"That man gives me the creeps\" Lavi said happily, as they neared the cafeteria<br>\"Don't you think he is creepy, Yuu?\" Kanda growled in The back of his throat like an angered cat hut he resisted the urge to slice him in two  \n>\"Tch, for a rabbit, you're quite the scardy cat\" he mocked giving a small sigh of relief as they finally reached the cafeteria. He didn't even need to say anything (which was just as he like it) as soon as Jerry saw him coming, he pt a bowl of soba on the bar, making some cheery comment or other that Kanda didn't pay any attention to. Lavi however seemed not to care that Kanda was clearly in the middle of his meal and plopped down on the bench beside him, still chatting away<br>\"I'm not the only one Kanda! Even Komui is more on edge than usual and no one can find Lenalee to calm him down with her usual cup of coffee\"  \n>Kanda froze momentarily but decided that as usual, silence was the best policy. If Lenalee didn't want to be found then that was her own business. He didn't care<br>\"Don't you think he is scary, Kanda?\" Lavi inquired, slouching back against the table a that he could get a good view of the stony faced boy. Kanda scowled more fiercely at the return of the pointless questions. He hated them almost as much as he hated pointless emotions. What did it matter how Rouvelier acted? It made no difference if he was sweetness and light or dark and twisted. He was in charge and when he gave an order, it was to be followed. That was all that was important. The petty comic actions that people liked to add to things like that just made it harder for em to properly fulfil their role and it made them even more useless than they would normally be  \n>\"Not everyone is as babyish as you. If your frightened of your own boss then maybe you shouldn't be fighting at all- if you are that scared of your own side you'll be useless against the enemy. There's the door. Your more than welcome to walk out of it\" he said scathingly to the fool, downing the rest of his soba in one but before he could stalk it of the room, Lavi laughed out loud<br>\"That's the longest speech I have ever got out of you, Yuu! We are making progress!\"  \n>With a flurry of motion, Kanda body slammed Lavi onto the floor<br>\"My name is Kanda, Baka Usagi!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen, Harry, Ron and Hermione lay stock still,their breath bated as they eavesdropped on Dumbledores conversation with Snape none of them daring to move, lest it be discovered that they weren't sleeping like the rest of their classmates. The next day, as soon as they managed to get a few moments to themselves, they discussed the recent development in hushed whispers<br>\"For goodness sake Allen, you are being completely paranoid! Of course Rhamnella isn't sneaking Sirius into the castle\" Hermione snapped impatiently- she had been doing little other than snapping recently, what with the exams approaching and her stress levels rocketing  \n>\"Didn't you listen when I told you about the dryads? You-know-who and his death eaters wiped most of them out when they were on power. Wy on earth would she help Sirius who is the biggest death eater of them all?\"<br>All eyes turned to Allen, who shifted uncomfortably under the scrutiny  \n>\"Well... She was hired this year\" he said, realising how feeble his argument sounded even to his own ears<br>\"She's always taking Mai on walks around the castle and the grounds. She's probably scouting the area or something\"  \n>All three of his friends gazed at him incredulously and he shrank back slightly, hugging his knees to his chest<br>\"She's just acting suspiciously!\" He insisted, pouting moodily. Ron snorted in derision  \n>\"She's Mai's tutor Allen, it's her job to look after her and teach her about plants and the history of the castle. You're not jealous are you?\" Allen looked completely taken aback by this comment and proceeded to violently deny that he was, ever had been or ever would be jealous of Rhamnella. All three of his friends fixed him with a disbelieving look and he spluttered something about needing to train before fleeing the common room with impressive speed. Hermione stood up and straitened her robes before following Allen though in a significantly more dignified manner saying something about two ruin essays and a muggle studies assignment that needed finishing. Ron and Harry glanced up at the huge clock resting on the mantelpiece it was 7 at night. Ron stood up too<br>\"Gobstones?\" He inquired in a business like manner\n\n\"Gobstones\" Harry confirmed with a grin\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen scowelled as he pummeled the punch bag willfully tuning out the ever present snide comments coming from the holligram. He wasn't jealous of that stupid tutor- I mean sure he had hardly seen his daughter in the past few months because she now had a strict 'nap time' over break and he had been forbidden from bringing her lunch time treats and from visiting her after his trips out of the school- something to do with sleep being essential for learning. That was clearly just a stupid excuse to keep him from her. He had hardly slept for longer than four hours in a row for the past month and he was just fine! Sure every now and again he would get double vision or fall asleep with his eyes open but apart from that he was just fine. It was obviously a huge conspiracy of Rhamnella's to replace him in Mai's affections and he was not going to let it happen. He would not let her win. Tonight he was going to go out and get the biggest bag of butter popcorn he could find and he would sit up late with her discussing her latest lessons and the behavior of her large toy collection. Stuff Rhamnella and her stupid 'healthy development'. He thumped the punch bag moodily, pouting childishly at it. He made his way over to the cupboard in which ho stored his broom and was just about to perform the disillusionment charm when Tim flapped panickedly in front of his face and projected an image of an incredibly pissed off Snape onto the wall. Allen groaned. He had forgotten about his detention. Snape had been waiting to pouch ever since he found out that Allen had been the one to upset his favorite pupil and earlier in the day had given Allen detention for 'looking bored'. With a heavy sigh, Allen returned his stuff to the cupboard and took off down the corridor at a sprint hoping he wouldn't end up with another detention for being late<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>He arrived at the dungeons just in time and a rather disappointed Snape waved him in to one of the workbenches where a young girl was already sitting. He instructed them to replenish his supply of bubotubor pus and left the dungeon leaving no doubt of the wrath that would reign down upon them if they didn't finish the task by the time he returned. Allen made his way across the room and joined the young girl at the table<p>\n\n\"Hey, my name's Allen\" He chirped, smiling\n\n\"Oh, I know who you are\" She replied rather dreamily, seeming utterly oblivious to how creepy this sounded. She swept her dirty blonde hair out of her face, deftly twisting it into a knot at the base of her neck before approaching the squirming, bulbous plant with a pin and a flask. She suddenly swept in, piercing one of the pustules and ducked as a jet of yellow pus shot out, raising the other hand, catching the stream deftly in the glass flask. She turned to face him, her pale blue eyes wide and vaguely curious. Allen sweat-dropped and edged his way around the table, trying to put as much distance between them as possible\n\n\"How do you know who I am\" He asked as calmly as possible, gingerly approaching his own bubotubor with a needle\n\n\"You are rather easily distunguishable\" She said with a half smile \"You saved Ginny from the basilisk last year. I like Ginny. She's kind to me\" She said the last bit as if she was talking to herself and Allen carefully maintained his distance from her.\n\n\"Yeah, well I didn't really saver, Harry actually...\" But before he could continue, she cut him off\n\n\"By the way, you didn't happen to notice if the snake had writing on its fangs did you?\" Allen stuttered in shock as he tried to come up with an appropriate response\n\n\"I.. The sn... erm.. no?\" She sighed as she collected another flask\n\n\"Shame. There is some debate as to whether Cornelious Fudge or the Weird Witches owned it\" Allen was once again completely wrong footed and at an utter loss of what to say. He then made the mistake of asking her why there was even a debate about that and a detailed explanation of some conspiracy involving the ministry, the music corporation and Dumbledore all in one giant mess of nonsense. By the end of her speech, Allen was actually finding her somewhat less scary and much more amusing, laughing aloud at some of the hairbrained ideas- so by the time Snape returned to find to his immense displeasure all of the bubotubors de-pused- he had quite forgotten his previous anger\n\n\n\t33. Chapter 33\n\n**coronadomontes- I will definitely consider it. I haven't really figured out all the details for the end of the story yet but I will definitely try not to leave Harry and the rest of the wizards out of it :P**\n\n**Raychael Dionzeros- Just what I was aiming for! Hope you enjoy this one too!**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- Yeah, Luna is one of my favorite characters- as to Dumbledore, I don't know, I have to say I find his character hard to figure out. I don't think I like him very much... he is more of an ends before the means kind of guy. I've not writen a family scene because when he adopted Mai and Allen, he did it for the battle plan- not for his own benifet but I do conceed I have perhaps been a little harsh on the guy. I will try to come up with some nice chapter or other for them, maybe in the next 'summer holidays'**\n\n**jozefien- Soon, it will coincide with the whole Sirius bit so I don't need to re-write that section or awkwardly write Allen into it. Definitely will happen in one of the next few updates though :D**\n\n**Guest- Well, I'll definitely keep that in mind :) Thanks for telling me! And thanks for the compliments, hope you like this chapter too**\n\n**Not-Your-Buisness- I'm updating! See! Here's an update! Please don't shoot me with a machine gun :'(**\n\n**I-Love-Chocolate- Hehe, yes, I'm gonna have a showdown between him and Rhamnella at some point! And no, I don't like her much either. Favorite chocolate?... Sooooo many :P Green and blacks butterscotch I think... or Cadburies milk. Or Galaxy caramel... :D**\n\n**Rex888- Tuhdah!**\n\nA distinctly christmassy air had descended upon Hogwarts- tinsle and holly had sprung up over night, twisting itself around the banisters and filling every crevice while icicles mysteriously hung from ceilings and mantle places alike. Students everywhere were packing excitedly for home or lounging lazily before the roaring fires comparing Christmas lists all with the exception of two students. Hermione was- as ever- somewhere under her fortress of textbooks and didn't seem to have any inclination of emerging any time soon. Allen on the other hand was running laps around the school, slowly boring a trench through the knee deep snow as he went. There were two other students besides these who were not busied about the usual activity. By the fire in the common room, two brothers sat side by side and conferred in low murmurs, warily watching passerby's lest their conversation be overheard. Nothing and no one was going to come between them and their plans for this Christmas.\n\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0\n\nIt was the morn of christmas eve and not a soul was stirring, not even... well... not a soul except...\n\n\"TIMCAMPY!\" Allen called as he made his way across the floor on his hands and knees, peering under the sofa. He glanced up and started as he noticed that he was not alone\n\n\"Hey, Hermione, you haven't seen Timcampy by any chance have you?\" He asked as he picked up the sofa cushions and peered hopefully under them\n\n\"I suppose you think Crookshanks is hunting him down too!\" She snapped acidly, her eyes sparking\n\n\"Oh no, of course not\" Allen laughed nervously waving his hands frantically in front of his face making a mental note to check the cat as soon as Hermione had left the room\n\n\"While we are on the subject of disappearing things though\" Hermione said in a slightly less hostile tine as she ran her finger down the spines of one of her many book towers\n\n\"You haven't seen my copy of 'Hogwarts: A History' have you?\" Allen shook his head and joined her in her search of the common room. They were both disturbed from their search coon after by a chorus of evil laughter. They spun around to see Fred and George sitting in one of the chairs in front of the fire, each wearing their respective Christmas jumpers and stroking a purring Crookshanks who was sitting very smugly in between them\n\n\"We have been expecting you\" They both chimed, their eyes fixed on their unfortunate prey\n\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0\n\n\"We have a proposition for you\" began George\n\n\"Well, its not _really_ a proposition\" Fred mildly pointed out \"They have no choice in the matter. A deal?\"\n\n\"No\" countered George in an equally blase tone \" Deal insinuates a choice too\" The two boys frowned in thought, then Fred brightened\n\n\"We have an ultimatum for you!\" He cried triumphantly\n\n\"Nah, that suggests that they made a move first, this is an utterly unprovoked attack, remember?\" George parried \"A demand?\" He suggested but before Fred could counter this as well, Hermione interrupted the banter\n\n\"Your blackmailing us?\" She asked indignantly. George snapped his fingers his face lighting up\n\n\"That's the word! Thanks Hermione. Yes, we are blackmailing you\" He said cheerily\n\n\"You two have been criminally un-festive\" Fred intoned seriously with the air of someone reading a list of serious crimes to a criminal in the docks\n\n\"Reading and training\" George continued gravely shaking his head\n\n\"Well no more\" They chimed together\n\n\"You both need to complete a series of challenges we give you with no breaks for studying or weight lifting or you will never see your beloved Timcampy or really-thick-textbook again\" Fred finished triumphantly and they both crossed their arms and leaned back with self-satisfied smirks plastered across their faces. Allen and Hermione exchanged exasperated looks but there was every little they could do other than sigh and nod in agreement. The twins let out exuberant cheers at this and handed them their timetables for the day assuring them that they would know if the tasks hadn't been properly carried out. They left the two alone to read over their orders of the day, exiting the common room with a cheery goodbye. The two blackmail-ees sat down next to each other and consulted their lists. Hermione let out a moan of annoyance\n\n\"We are _so _going to get expelled for this!\" Allen nodded silently \"What's your first challenge?\" She asked curiously \"Mine is to have a 15 minute conversation with Professor Flitwick using the words Merlin's pants, flaming oranges, peeves, Dumbledore and flibertigibbit\" She ended her sentence in a horrified whisper and buried her head in her arms quietly whimpering. Allen sympathetically patted her arm, struggling to surpress a grin\n\n\"My first one is great- I'm to take Mai down to the lake for breakfast and I've been ordered to have at least one snowball fight and I'm to build a snowdragon\"\n\nHermione shot him a look of indignation\n\n\"That's so not faiiir!\" She wailed\n\n\"I'm going to die from embarrassment... I just know it!\"\n\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0\n\nHermione rocked back and forwards on her heels nervously in front of professor Flitwicks room rehearsing her speech in her head. Those stupid twins! If hexing wasn't against the school rules, the both would have antlers for ears, them and their stupid Christmas spirit. And why on earth did Allen have such a simple first challenge? He was away down to the lakeside for a snow fight with his daughter whereas she was about to humiliate herself in front of one of her favorite proffers. She hoped his later challenges would be just as horrible. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself and knocked on his door  \n>\"Er, hello professor\" she squeaked when the door opened<br>\"If you are here about the exams again\" professor Flitwick sighed \" I've already told you- you did better than everyone in the class. Stop worrying about the few marks you lost and concentrate on enjoying your break!\" Hermione steeled herself and in hurried tones said  \n>\"Merlin's pants! Is that peeves juggling flaming oranges over Dumbledore head? Oh no. It's not. My mistake. Merry Flibertijibbit sir!\" And with that she turned tail and ran down the corridor, her heart pounding in her chest and her cheeks flaming red but despite this, a reluctant chuckle escaped her pursed lips.<p>\n\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0  \n>Allen packed a wicker basket with steaming hot blueberry muffins and stacks of toast with mini jam pots tucked in beside them. He threw a cloth over the top and ran up to the nursery, taking the steps two at a time. He burst through the door and swept a startled Mai up in his arms, twirling her around the room<p>\n\n\"What do you say to a Christmas Eve pick nick down by the lake followed by a snowball fight and a snow sculpture contest\" he sang as he danced the giggling toddler in a waltz around the nursery  \n>\"Yes please Pappy!\" She cheered. A few minutes later- with Mai swaddled in multiple layers- they exited the school and made their way down to the frozen lake, Mai perched in her usual spot on Allen's shoulders carrying two thermos flasks, one of hot chocolate and one of hot ginger. Allen had one hand steadying the squirming toddler and the other swinging the basket of goodies. Two hours later, the pair trooped back wearily, cheeks flushed with the cold and the remainders of the snowball battle still clinging to their clothes. Behind them at the lake, the two dragon inspired lumps of snow stood out against the now brilliantly blue sky as they stood guard over the almost completely frozen Great Lake<br>0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0  \n>Allen joined Hermione at the lunch table and- after devouring everything within arms reach they exchanged details on their challenges before consulting the list again. This time, it was Allen's turn to groan and slump down on the table muttering the words<br>\"Definitely getting expelled for this\" Hermione gave a smug grin and waved her list in front of his face I just have to read at least two fiction books in front of the fire in the common room with a box of chocolates. She punched the air triumphantly  \n>\"Wait a minute, where am I going to get the chocolate?\" At that minute, Fed and George seemed to materialise our if nowhere and handed Hermione a box of Honeyduke's chocolates tied up neatly with a red bow<br>\"Merry Christmas Eve\" they chimed together \"oh, and good luck Allen\" Fred chuckled, slapping him bracingly on the shoulder before disappearing into the crowd of milling students  \n>\"What is yours? Hermione said curiously, plucking the list out of Allen's limp grip. She scanned it quickly before bursting out laughing and handing it back to him.<br>\"Good luck!\" She sang as she half ran out of the hall up to the library clutching the box of chocolates to her chest  \n>0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-<br>Allen crawled his way up to the back of the greenhouses and slipped his wand out of his pocket  \n>\"Alohamora\" he whispered and the latch of the window clicked open. He froze for a few seconds and after he was sure that professor sprout hadn't heard he crept over and eased it open, poking his head through. He caught his breath when he spotted the professor, with her back to him. He wriggled about till he managed to manoeuvre his wand arm through the window too and whispered<br>\"Wingardium leviosa\" levitating two baskets of flitterbloom seeds to ceiling height. He squeezed his head our of the window and readied himself to run before releasing the spell and sprinting back across the school grounds with yells coming from the greenhouse behind him as the plants burst into bloom all over the professor. A few minutes later Allen, two red heads jogged back to the castle too with suspiciously bulging robes and a mischievous glint in their eyes.  \n>0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>Allen joined a significantly more relaxed Hermione in the common room and after helping himself to the remaining chocolates, the two consulted their lists again and let out simultaneous cries of horror.  \n>\"He's going to kill me!\" Allen whimpered while Hermione just stared blankly at hers<br>\"I'm getting expelled this time. Definitely. If it wasn't an extra rare signed and extended version of Hogwarts: A History, I'd say the twins were welcome to it\" the swapped lists and quickly returned them to their owners  \n>\"I can't figure out which one is the worst!\" Allen moaned<br>\"How about we team up for the last two? We can do mine first then borrow Harry's invisibility cloak for the other and so it tonight\" Hermione nodded in agreement and the two of them set off for the school dungeons  \n>0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>Hermione and Allen squished themselves into one of the empty classrooms and eased the door open a crack to watch the fun. A few minutes ticked by and nothing happened  \n>\"Are you sure that we did the spell right?\" Allen whispered \"I've never used that one before\" Hermione shrugged<br>\"Your welcome to go out and check but I'm staying right here\" she replied but before Allen could say anything else, it started. The suit if armour at the end if the corridor burst into a squeaky version of \"let it snow\" Hermione raised one eyebrow at Allen who shrugged sheepishly  \n>\"my first time using the spell\" he whispered but Hermione grabbed his arm silencing him as Snape rounded the corner, looking livid. He very quickly found the culprit and shot a spell at the suit if armor silencing it. He had turned and was striding back to his office when a holly wreath began to sing a tuneless 'jingle bells' Allen raised an eyebrow back at Hermione who stuck her tongue out at him and shrugged. Snape silenced that too with increasing irritation when from out in the corridor the tinsel wrapped around the staircase harmonized over 'frosty the snowman' with a look of sheer and unbridled fury on his face, Snape strode out of the dungeons. Allen and Hermione exchanged looks and in mutual agreement they sprinted from their hiding spot and slipped into one of the broom cupboards in the main hall just in time to see Snape silence the tinsel with one furious wave of his wand. The two hiding teenagers shook with surprised laughter as the watched him visibly draw a deep breath and walk in a dignified manor back to his room.<br>\"Three. Two...\" Whispered Allen one on the count of one, all the remaining baubles, clumps of holly and bundles of mistletoe burst into 'here comes Santa Claus' and with a snarl of anger, Snape spun around and in one sweeping wave he tuned all the decorations into a heap of ashes before marching back into the dungeons and slamming the door with excessive force behind him. A peal of laughter rang out from the broom cupboard and the two teens half fell out as they clutched to each other in a vein attempt to support each other as they gasped for air  \n>\"Only one more to go now\" Allen said weakly when he finally caught his breath<br>\"Yeah, thank goodness for that\" Hermione replied, wiping tears of laughter from her face \"I'm not sure how much more my poor heart can put up with\"  \n>0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0<p>\n\nThat night as soon as everyone had gone to bed, the two teen crept out of the common room with Harry's cloak wrapped firmly around them. They padded their way down the ash-covered stairs and drew out their wands, whispering the charm they had been practicing all evening. With a satisfied look, they examined their work, awkwardly high fived under the cloak and crept back up to the dormitory and fell asleep, both quickly falling into the deepest, dreamless sleep that they had had all term.\n\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-00-0-0-0-0-0\n\nThe next morning, cries of delight echoed around the school as the pupils stirred and made their way down the stairs to find the entire entrance hall was covered in a thick layer of ice and all the way up the banister, ice-skating blades were tied with ribbons. One by one, the pupils made their way gingerly out onto the ice and began to skate in huge rings around the hall, their excited laughter and chatter ringing around the whole school. Hermione and Allen ran down as soon as they woke and joined in- Hermione clinging rather nervously to the side, but Allen having spent so much of his life doing balancing and agility training took to it with ease and was soon skating literal rings around the other pupils. Luna (who's dad was away hunting Purple ringed Snorcrackers or some such thing) soon proved to be a match for him and in no time they were in somewhat of a competition. Luna flew out to the center which had very quickly been vacated by the other pupils and lept into the air, traveling a good meter or so before landing perfectly. Allen retaliated by flying equally quickly out to the middle and with a snap of skates leaping into the air and twisting 180 degrees, landing perfectly and skating backwards, skidding to a halt beside Luna. She started skating in lazy circles that got tighter and tighter til she snapped her skates together and hugged her arms tight to her body, spinning in tight circles til she became a blur. Allen copied her as soon as she had gone and the two twirled in sickening blurs. Neither probably would have given up but the cheers of the students died down and it soon became evident why\n\n\"_What in the name of all that is holy has happened!\"_ came a cry from the stairs and Allen and Luna ceased spinning to see Professor Macgonnagle an Dumbledore standing at the head of the staircase. The two dizzy teens clung to each other for support but their centre of gravity had been so far flung out that it was only a few seconds before they both thumped down on the ice and neither even atempted to move from the spot as they watched the teachers to see what they would do. Profesor Macgonnagle looked like she was about to blow her top but Dumbledore just chuckled quite cheerily and with a wave of his wand, skates appeared on the soles of his shoes and he skated quite calmly across the hall, opening the doors to the dining hall with a wave of his wand\n\n\"Well, don't just stand there gawping\" He cried \"There's a feast to be eaten!\" And with a cheer the entire student body- and a rather reluctant Profesor Magonnagle- made their way into the dining room. Allen and Hermione had barely sat down before a laughing George and Fred made their way across to them, releasing a very disgruntled Timcampy who quickly flew over to join Allen and Mai, settling comfortably on Allen's head and maintaining a healthy distance from Mai. They handed Hermione back her textbook too with a wink and a cheery \"Merry Christmas\"\n\nThe spread of food was just as fantastically ridiculous as it always was- though it didn't really seem like such a ridiculous amount this year, with Allen stuffing every dish within arms reach into his seemingly bottomless stomach. They had just started on the enormous turkeys when Fred and George once again joined them\n\n\"Watch closly\" Fred said nodding up to the staff table \"Your about to see the fruits of your work\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Allen asked curiously but they just nodded again so the two turned to face the staff table. At first they couldn't see anything but after a few minutes, they started to notice that maybe Dumbledore's beard was getting slightly thicker than usual. They exchanged curious looks and turned back. The teachers seemed not to have noticed anything and were pulling their Christmas crackers. Out of Dumbledore's cracker fell a bright red hat, trimmed with white wool and all the teachers received green pointy hats. At this stage both Hermione and Allen twigged onto what was happening- both having been raised in a muggle world. The teachers noticed not soon after and with cries, their hands flew to their ears which had grown long and pointy. By this stage, Dubledore's bead had expanded to twice its usual size and, laughing as unrestranedly as usual, he pulled his hat on his head and perched his wire-rimmed spectacles on the edge of his nose\n\n\"Very well done\" He laughed jovially \"Whomever carried out this prank\" He sent a rather piercing look to Fred and George \"It was very well done. Merry Christmas!\" The students all laughed, though those from wizarding backgrounds seemed not to find it quite as funny as the others\n\n\"We got the idea from hearing you two going on about muggle studies\" Fred said\n\n\"Yeah, we replaced Flitwicks crakers when you distracted him Hermione\" George chipped in\n\n\"And got the ingredients for the morphing potion when you both distracted Snape and Sprout. Good going there by the way\" Fred continued\n\n\"And then smeared the potion around the rim of the goblets while you had everyone distracted by the ice rink\" George finished triumphantly \"I know. We are geniuses. You don't need to tell us\"\n\nAllen laughed at this \"Yeah _right_. But what about the snowball fight with Mai and the books you made Hermione read?\"\n\n\"Than was just our little present to you both\" They chimed together \"Your welcome! Merry Christmas!\"\n\nAnd with that they disappeared back to join Lee and their other friends at the other end of the table\n\n**This is your christmas gift! Hope you all have a great time and aren't driven mad by your families- tis the season of Goodwill to all men! Apologies for spelling again- this was once again written on my ipod which is unreliable at the best of times :) Glad we all survived the Mayan calendar disaster and here's to another year of living on this earth! **\n\n\n\t34.

I tried to make that chapter as light as possible- I notice most my chapters are pretty depressing (this one is no exception) so its nice to throw in a few silly chapters :)**\n\n**Guest- I didn't really forget, I just didn't really think it was useful to the story to add it in as an afterthought and I wanted the focus to be the run up to Christmas and the pranks rather than think up some birthday scene. I'm really glad you enjoyed the story :D**\n\n**PoisonousDemon- I know, I'm really sorry- I've been laptop-less for a month now so I wrote and published that on my ipod which is not easy- they layout is pretty hard to figure out. Please tell me if its better this time :)**\n\n**Oragamilotus- I WANT COOOOOOOKIES! Totally sympathise though- my plans for this weekend are also baking with my little sister :S Should be fun! Yeah, the twins are so much fun to write- though they are mean to poor little Allen :P**\n\n**Diavo- Aww, hope your feeling better and I'm glad I cheered you up- Lucky you being in Africa though! Forgive me for getting a little fangirliish about it but I love Africa (I know thats rather broad- rather I love where I've been in Africa) I went on holiday to Botswana a few years ago and I'm away to Ghana this summers as a charity thing to build a hospital. My plan is actually to move out there for a while at least after I graduate from my nursing programme... anway enough rambling. Hope you had a great time and a wonderful christmas :)**\n\n**Lisel- Oh I knew, Mai is pretty frightening and she seems to have a bit of an obsession with poor little Harry**\n\nHarry had ony been to one lesson with Proffesor Lupin when Allen returned early from one of his trips, trembling and even paler than he normally was. He didn't say much all night, just asked Harry if he could join on the next lesson and then fell into a brooding silence, staring unseeingly into the fire and shivering every now and again, as if some chilled breeze had swept through the room. Harry was rather relieved to see that it was not only him that reacted so strongly to the dementors presense but he very quickly began to rather regret having invited Allen along. By the end of his first lesson, he had already produced what Lupin called a 'corporeal' patronus and Harry was still struggling to produce so much as a vapor. His Patronus was a shining silver wolf and Harry couldn't help but feel a little jelous as it soared gracefully around the room a few times before trotting over to Allen's side like an obedient dog. Allen himself was to thrilled to notice Harry's annoyance and he seemed very taken by the animal, announcing to each of his friends separately- as Ron and Harry were still refusing to talk to Hermione- that it was in fact an Arctic wolf and then he continued to reel of a long list of interesting facts that bored even Hermione by the third or fourth repetition. Harry and Allen's roles however completely reversed when it came to fighting against the boggart. If anything, Allen's reaction to the faux dementor was more violent than Harry's. It's effects didn't seem to fade much either and Harry had been woken on more than one occasion with Allen crying out in his sleep from some nightmare or other. At the end of one of their lessons, after Allen had left, Harry asked Lupin a question that had been weighing on him for a while\n\n\"Sir, why do the dementors have such an effect on Allen and I?\" Lupin sighed and sat down\n\n\"Both you and Allen have horrors in your past that most adults don't have. The dementors use your past as a weapon against you so it is no surprise that they effect you two more so than your classmates\" Harry nodded thoughtfully then after a short pause he tentatively said \"And why do they effect Allen more than me?\" Lupin ran his fingers through his greying hair and seemed to think long and hard about the answer, choosing his words carefully\n\n\"Allen was older than you when his particular tragedy struck him, not only had he therefore formed a closer bond with his father (1) but he was also more aware of what was going on and therefore his memories are not only clearer but also hold somewhat stronger emotion than perhaps yours- not of course that this minimises your pain from your past. It's just different\" Harry nodded, all feelings of jealousy completely disappearing\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen was rounding the corridor to Mai's room when he bumped into Rhamnella. He apologised profusely but she waved away his niceties<p>\n\n\"I've been meaning to talk to you anyway. Let's go in here\" She gripped his arm and marched him into one of the empty classrooms, lighting the chandelier with a flick of her wand. She gestured wordlessly to a chair and sat in her own, ramrod strait, with a rather severe expression on her face\n\n\"I wan't Mai to go to a proper primary school\" She stated with no preamble, staring expectantly at Allen, clearly expecting some sort of reply. Allen wasn't capable of speech for a few seconds, so stunned he was by the curveball. He mouthed wordlessly trying to come up with an elegant argument however, as usual, his brain failed him\n\n\"With all due respect ma'am, no. I made a deal with Dumbledore- Mai and I were not to be separated, I've had her taken of me once already and I will not let it happen again. She stays here. That is final\" His voice shook slightly at the end and he struggled to keep his voice level. Rhamnella just shook her head and pursed her lips\n\n\"I was afraid you would take this stance. She is a child, not a plaything. She needs to be with children of her own age- it's not healthy for her to be surrounded by those so much older than her\" Allen literally reeled with this verbal blow, leaning back on his seat, the blood draining out of his face and he replied in a tone so frosty you could practically feel the room's temperature drop\n\n\"I raised Mai on my own from she was but a few days old. I fed her and cared after her on the streets of Japan, slaving so that I could care for her and foregoing food so that she would have enough to eat. You have no idea what we went through. Plaything? I love that child more than my own life and you say plaything?\" He let out a bitter laugh and before he did something he would regret, he strode out of the room, resisting the temptation to slam the door in a fit of rage\n\n* * *\n\n><p>That night, Harry was struggling to sleep again, memories of his parents swirling maddeningly around in his head. He head a rustle from Allen's bed and he curiously poked his head around the curtains of the four poster. Allen was pulling clothes on over his pyjamas, obviously struggling to sleep. Harry rolled back over into his bed. He would never understand how Allen had the willpower to leave his warm bed to go outside in the wintertime. It struck him just he was settling down to sleep that Allen had looked rather strange- his usually ivory white skin had seemed almost... gray. Harry dismissed the thought as drowsiness finally crept over him. Must've been a trick of the light or something.<p>\n\nIf he had continued to watch his friend, he might have been rather more concerned. Allen walked rather zombie-like, still half asleep to the end of the dorm, reaching out confidently for the door handle at the wrong part of the wall. His brow wrinkled slightly in confusion but after feeling about for one he eventually found the door and strode confidently through, nearly falling down the steps, completely misjudging where they were. He made his way down to the common room and seemed to get his bearings back and although it took some time to navigate his way through the portrait hole, he strode purposefully through the school, till once again he seemed not to notice a set of stairs. He jerked suddenly as he caught himself and he seemed to snap out of a trance. He looked around himself in confusion and slowly made his way back to the common room, glancing around him as if expecting someone to jump out and tell him it had been a practical joke. The moonlight shone over his pale face but he eventually seemed to dismiss it, sinking back into his four poster and falling immediately into a deep sleep\n\n(1)- They still think Mana was Allen's father\n\nfor those of you who are interested, I chose a Wolf as his patronus as they are pack animals and are very loyal to their group. I chose arctic wolf purely because they are pretty. And white :P\n\n\n\t35. Chapter 35\n\n_**A/N This is a long preamble. My responses to people is written like**_ **this** _**and you can ignore the rest if your aren't interested**_\n\n_**If you are interested, I just wanted to share something about myself. I am going out this summer to Ghana to build a hospital- I am working with a company called reallywildchallanges who will send me and my friends out to Ghana and supply materials to build a health centre if we each raise £2500 for Marie curie and sick kids jointly.

You should be gratefull that this is even readable because my spelling is pretty atrocious too :P Just correct me when you find a mistake and I'll go fix it :)**\n\nAllen took up a firm stance, holding his body weight low and swaying lightly from foot to foot, staring determinedly at the trunk in the middle of Lupins classroom. He closed is eyes, taking deep breaths and concentrating hard on something. Eventually, he opened his eyes and nodded to Lupin who in turn opened the trunk. Filthy grey smoke spewed out of its depths and rose up in a tower, forming the tall figure of the dementor. Allen raised hhis wand desperately but hardly got the word \"expect\" out of hi mouth before his eyes rolled back in his head and he fell to the floor. Lupin sent the dementor back to its box and patiently revive his pupil, handing him over a box of toffees as allen had complained about chocolate after a few lessons. He sat down beside the young boy and took a piece for himself\n\n\"What memory are you using Allen? I think you are going to have to change it- its clearly not working for you\"\n\n\"I'm using the first time i took Mai on the carousel ride and that was the first time she laughed. It is the happiest memory I have- I cant understand why it wont work\"\n\nLupin considered this for a while then \"Well tell me then what memory the dementors are using against you. Its not always about how happy the memory is but sometimes it is about how strong it is. If this happy memory is in any way linked to your bad memories, it makes it easier for them to corrupt it\"\n\nIt was Allen's turn this time to sit in silence. He didn't reply until he had half finished the box of toffee's. He heaved a great sigh and said\n\n\"The circumstances I got Mai in weren't exactly ideal. I found her only a few days after my fathers death and that memory is what they always use against me\"\n\nLupin nodded \"Well that explains why you were having such trouble. You are just going to have to find a happy memory that cant be linked with your fathers death and then you should be fine\" He took the box o toffees back and started setting the classroom back in order\n\n\"It'll have to wait until next lesson though. you are too tired to go through this again today\"\n\nAllen however didn't leave strait away. He hovered uncertainly by the door for a while before blurting out\n\n\"But sir, all of my happy memories are with Mai- I don't have any that aren't linked with her so all of them are corrupted\" His shoulders slumped despondently \"I'll never be able to make a Patronus\" he wailed despairingly\n\nLupin strode over to Allen and frowned rather disapprovingly at him\n\n\"Is your life here so horrible that you have not one happy memory out of the year and a half you've spent here? Are your friends so terrible that they have never once made you laugh or smile? Is Dumbledore such a horrible foster father that he has never made you feel safe or cared for? You need to stop being so selfish Allen and realise that you aren't the only person capable of caring for people- your friends all love you and you are surrounded by people who care for you. Don't insult them by imagining that you are all alone in the world.\" He walked over to the trunk againn and stood beside it, hand on the latch\n\n\"Think this time Allen and tell me when you are ready\"\n\nAllen closed his eyes, waves of shame and confusion crashing alternately over him. He hadn't thought of it that way before. He was so used to being the one who cared and the one who sacrificed that he had been blind to what others had been doing for him. He remembered now all the times Ron, Harry and Hermione had stood by him, supported him even when they knew he was keeping secrets from them. All the times they had cheered him up and helped him. He remembered how Madame Pomfrey and so many of the other teachers had made him feel at home for the first time in since Mana. He remembered how Dumbledore had helped him when he most needed help an how he had so many times calmed him down after a restless night or a bad Akuma encounter with kind words and a steaming mug of hot butterbeer. More than any one memory however, how just concentrated on the feeling of protection and safety he had enjoyed while around his new family. He allowed the feeling to fill him up until he almost felt like bursting and then he needed to Lupin, who flicked the catch, setting the Bogart loose once more. This time however, the dense chill didn't sweep over his body like it normally did and for a split second,the happy memories protected him from its powers. He raised hhis wand again and shouted the incantation before the brief respite disappeared. The huge silver wolf erupted from the and tip and at his command, chased the bogart back into the box.\n\nAllen exited the room with a huge grin plastered across his face and Lupin's words of praise still echoing around his head, feeling more contented that he had since the start of the term, when the Dementors were first introduced.\n\nAllen slowed slightly as he passed the darkened library, a pang of guilt hitting him. Between all the training and revising he had been doing, he had been able to do very little for Hagrid and Buckbeak. The execution was set for tomorrow and it seemed like there was no hope left. Stupid Malfoy and his insatiable ego- both him and his father were stuck up morons but there really was nothing to be done at this stage. Allen sighed and after deliberating for a moment, he headed off to the room of requirement. He would be back in time for the execution- to be with Hagrid but at the moment, he really needed to get out- due to the increase in Dementor patrols and his inability to be about them without passing out, he hadn't been able to get out for months. Just the thought of all those souls he hadn't been able to save turned his stomach but now he had managed to master the Patronus, he would be fine. He ran up to the owlry first to search for Timcampy but the little golem had once again gone missing- he probably was wondering about the forbidden forest somewhere traumatising Bowtruckles and Fairies alike. He paused uncertainly for a short while but he couldn't leave it for another night- he had already wasted so much time. He set his face determinedly and swung himself onto his broom, casting his Patronus to fly before himself, bursting through the ranks of thhe Dementors and the barrier, shooting out into the clear nights sky\n\nLenalee sat patiently on the sofa in front of her snoring brother as section chief Reever lent down and quietly whispered in his ear\n\n\"Komui, did ya hear? Lenalee is getting married!\" Komui shot out of his seat faster than a bulled from a gun and clung to Lenalee's skirts sobbing about how she had broken his heart and about how he was going to brake the boys neck. She blushed brightly and gave him to the count of ten before braining him with her clipboard. This seemed to bbring him back to his senses surpriingly quickly and he pulled a few files from his desk\n\n\"There is a new phenomenon we need investigating. There is a small town from which we think no one is able to enter or leave. Deliveries are ordered every week yet supplies never manage to reach them had the delivery men can never explain why and yet, each week the same deliveries are made. we believe Innocence is involved\" He handed over the information pack for her to look over\n\n\"Is it just me going out, brother?\" she asked as she poured over the booklet. She glanced up and to her dismay, her brothers eyes were streaming again\n\n\"Yes, poor little sister! Kanda and Lavi were sent off on another mission last night so its just you but we can cancel, what was I thinking sending you on your own? There's no way I could let you do that my little angel!\" but before he could carry on, she brained him one last time and stood up primly\n\n\"I'll leave right away\" she said, ignoring his wails of 'Lenaleeeeeee' and striding out of his office without a backward glance.\n\nIt was just starting to get light out when Allen came across a small village. He Hadn't come across one Akuma all night and he was starving. After a moments consideration, he landed and cast a disillusionment charm on his broom and backpack before setting off into town. It was the weekend anyway so it didn't really matter what time he came back at. It was quite a quaint little place and after realising that they didn't have any all-you-can-eat buffets, he wondered into a small restaurant and settled for ordering everything. Twice. He was just polishing off his second bacon and eggs when he saw something that almost caused his heart to stop. Amongst the crowds of blondes and brunettes, he saw a green haired girl. He twisted in his seat, straining to get a better look at her. The crowd thinned somewhat and he got a better look at her- it was definitely the exorcist girl- she looked rather lost, staring down each street she passed and frequently turning around to see what was behind her. He watched her curiously but then her searching eyes found his. Allen caught his breath and spun around, ducking his head and avidly staring at the table cloth. There was no reason she should think anything of it- he was just a stranger who happened to catch her eye but he was a white haired, scarred young stranger. He groaned and thumped his head on the table. Suddenly the resteraunt bell rang, he turned in his seat staying low and his worst fears were confirmed- she was standing in the doorway, scanning the room for someone- for him! Keeping low down, he slipped off his seat and made his way slowly to the fire exit door, ducking behind the tables as he went. He had almost reached it when a voice ran out across the resteraunt\n\n\"Hey, you there- can I talk to you please?\" Without a backwards glance, he flung himself out the door and sprinted off down the street, randomly picking streets and lanes to run down, trying to throw her off his trail. He almost fell over as he sharply turned another corner and all of a sudden, his eye activated. It honed in on an Akuma at the end of the street, hovering over a cowering figure. He straitened up and walked down the cobbled street, trying to get as close to the creature as he could without alerting it to his presence. It seemed to be talking to her which was weird but ten it reached out its long claws to her exposed neck and he figured he had waited long enough\n\n\"Please let go of her\" He said calmly, hoping to distract the Akuma from the young woman and catch it off guard.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Akuma\" He smiled as it turned to face him\n\nLenalee danced from rooftop to rooftop, frustratedly scanning the streets for the white haired boy. She had been searching for hours but he seemed to have disappeared completely. It was possible of course that he had nothing too do with innocence or the strange phenomenon but innocence had a tendency to make itself noticeable and he certainly had been noticeable. She spun around sharply when she heard a loud bang somewhere behind her. Without a moments hesitation, she flew off in the direction of the noise. As she neared it, a woman ran full tilt past her but she payed little attention, more shocked by the white haired young boy who was mid-battle with an Akuma and seemed to be fighting it with his arm- and winning!. The young boy leapt through the air and brought the claws of his hand down with tremendous force on the Akuma and leapt back before it exploded. Determined not to loose him again, Lenalee sprinted down to him\n\n\"Wait a minute please, we need to talk\" The boys eyes widened as soon as he saw her and he tried to run away but she caught up with him\n\n\"I'm not going to hurt you- I just want to talk\" she cried, catching his arm and spinning him around. He tried to twist out of her grip and run away again but she caught a hold of his other arm and held him steady. He wriggled like a caught fish and succeeded in freeing himself- she only just managed to catch a hold of him again before he ran away\n\n\"I wont hurt you- I just want to talk\"\n\nAllen nervously walked into a small coffee shop, with the exorcist girl- Lenalee keeping a firm grip on his sleeve. He had ran away multiple times but soon found that he was unable to leave the town. Every time he had tried to get beyond a certain point, he found himself back in the town again. As much as he distrusted the Order, he needed to figure out how to get out so he could get back to Hogwarts before lessons started again. They sat down at one of the tables and Allen ordered the whole stand of cupcakes- He was going to need a lot of sugar to get through this\n\n\"There's this thing called Innocence\" Lenalee started as Allen tucked into his tower of cupcakes \"And a counter substance called dark matter which that monster you killed is made from. I work for a company who fight against the man who makes these monsters and try to collect all the pieces of innocence we can. We would like to recruit you and figure pout how to stop your innocence from trapping this town in a bubble\" Allen looked at her, half confused and half amused\n\n\"I know what Innocence and Akuma are, I have been using my innocence for quite some time. I don't have anything to do with this town being stuck- I got caught in here just like you. In fact I was hopping you would be able to help me get out. I think I saw the woman responsible for this but she ran away when I started to fight the Akuma.\" Lenalee gaped at him for some time before finding her voice\n\n\"You're the rogue exorcist \" she gasped when she regained her breath\n\n\"I've been ordered to take you in\"\n\nThere was a long silence during which Allen downed the rest of his cakes, politely wiped his mouth and then calmly pointed out that neither of them was going anywhere or doing anything any time soon unless they spoke to the woman causing the town to rewind and if she wanted the chance to try and arrest him, she may wish to try and catch the woman who was standing right outside the shop.\n\nLenalee sat opposite the terrified woman who seemed to be the centre of all the chaos. This was not a good situation she was in- stuck in a rewinding town with a hysterical woman and a completely unknown entity. Besides all that, she had to rely on this strange boy for help. Miranda, nervous as she was trusted him because he had saved her and she knew she couldn't arrest him and figure this out by herself because the already terrified woman would probably freak out completely. On the other hand, she had no idea what motives were driving this boy, whose side he was on and what he would do with the innocence if he got a hold of it before she did. She would just need to play along with him for the time being and once the innocence had been discovered, neutralise him. Once he came to the order and found out what they were really about he wouldn't be o hostile and she would have another brother. He looked kind and gentle despite his aversion to the order. He was polite too and had a way of talking to the half-crazed woman that kept her sane. Yes, he would soon see that the order was ultimately a force for good and they would have two more additions to the family. All of a sudden, Allen stood up\n\n\"You may wish to take her out of here\" He said calmly, his scarred eye turning black with a searing red pupil\n\n\"These village people aren't quite what they seem\" He stood up, his arm seamlessly transforming into the huge claw she had seen before as the three villagers twisted and warped into Akuma. Lenalee made a split second decision and grabbed Miranda by the waist, shooting out the door and speeding across the rooftops. She sent a worried look back to the small shop but there was nothing she could do- she had to protect the innocence at all costs.\n\nAllen staggered up to the apartment, a small line of blood trickling out of his ear and an even longer one soaking through the leg of his trousers. Inside, Miranda was feverishly polishing a large grandfather clock. He explained to Lenalee what had happened with the Akuma and she listened attentively\n\n\"There was no way you could have taken on three level two's by yourself anyway. You were lucky they stopped when they did\" She smiled gently, as she held out a first aid kit questioningly. Allen paused momentarily then nodded and rolled up his trouser leg for her to clean the wound\n\n\"I want to talk to you abut the order Allen, I really think once I explain...\" He gently placed a finger on her lips, silencing her\n\n\"I am sorry, Lenalee. You seem like a very nice person and it is nothing personal but I could never join t he order. I know what they do and I know how they act. They place the needs of some above the needs of others based on whether or not it is profitable for them to help. If innocence isn't involved in an Akuma's presence, they dont help- they leave the Akuma to suffer\" Lenalee gave him a questioning look and he smiled slightly\n\n\"My eye, it lets me see the trapped souls inside the Akuma. It lets me see their pain and suffering as they are forced to kill. I don't care about innocence or politics, I just want to save as many Akuma as possible and joining the order won't help me do that. Besides all that, I know the Order's track record isn't exactly squeaky clean- I have a young daughter and I don't want her to get cauught up in anything\" He chuckled at the shocked look on Lenalee's face \"She's adopted\" He said, answering her unasked question. Before she could say anything else, the town started to rewind again, a huge gale sweeping through the room. Lenalee reached for him and he caught her hand, clinging on for dear life as his feet were swept out from under him\n\nAllen balanced in a practiced way on top of a huge circus ball- it was funny how all his circus skills seemed to come back so easily. This situation he was in was just so strange- he had to make a woman he had never met before in his life feel worthwhile so that he could escape this crazy town and get back to Hogwarts. He had already been away two days- it was not good. Not good at all. Lenalee smiled at him as she handed out leaflets to passer by's. He hadn't really meant to tell her so much about his life but she was just so trustworthy- besides, he had told him a lot of personal information as well. A cry distracted him from his thoughts- poor Miranda had been pick pocketed. In a vain attempt to get the money back and convince her that she wasn't completely useless, Allen chased after then man with Lenalee hot on his heels but when they eventually caught up with his, he turned out to be an Akuma\n\n\"It's a trap\" Allen cried uselessly but it was too late for either of them to escape the battle. They both flew viciously to their own Akuma however the same one Allen had faced the last time let out its ungodly shriek which spilt its way through both the teens heads making it almost impossible to focus on anything but making the noise stop. Allen gritted his teeth and dodged an ice bullet from the other Akuma, reachiing into his pocket and pulling out his wand\n\n\"Silencio\" He yelled, hardly able to hear his own voice. The shriek stopped but his ears were ringing so loudly he hardly noticed at first then gathering his its, he attacked\n\n\"Help me!\" He yelled to Lenlee who left up and brought her foot down with tremendous force on his hand, driving his claw deep down into the Akuma's metal shell and for the first time since Alexi's father, he felt his Innocence changing into its gun shape. He very quickly sent of as many successive shots as he could before it reverted to its usual form, he jumped away from the unfortunate Akuma and glanced up as it exploded, smiling ever so slightly as he saw the soul escape from it and soar off into the sky just before another explosion knocked him off his feet and his vision turned black\n\nHe came too slowly, foggyness clinging to his brain like a thick cloud. He blinked repeatedly to clear his vision and even when it did eventually clear, he couldn't believe his eyes. Miranda was impaled by spikes onto her beloved clock. Lenalee was slumped in a high backed chair, a young, freaky looking kid grinning next to her wearing her exorcist coat\n\n\"Lenalee!\" He screamed and tried to move toward her but he was unable to move and a sudden blinding pain shot through his arm. He turned in disbelief to look at his arm which was pinned to the wall with the same candy striped spikes that were holding Miranda. He looked in desperation and confusion at the young kid who was dancing around Lenalee's chair, singing her name cheerily\n\n\"What are you doing?\" He gasped \"why are you helping the Akuma? Akuma hunt and kill humans and you are a human. Why are you helping them?\" The child's grin widened as she licked a drop of blood off her fingertip\n\n\"Akuma can be used by humans to kill other humans. I and my family are the true disciples. We are righting the balance of the world. Together with the Millennium Earl we will build a new world free from you weak humans. We are the true apostles of god\"\n\nAllen reeled in shock. Humans working for the very man who was trying to wipe humans from earth to replace them with twisted machines powered by sorrow and pain. No. He couldn't let this happen. He had to save Lenalee and Miranda and the Akuma and this young girl whose mind had been so twisted. Ignoring the pain, he ripped his arm off the wall. The pain blasted through his body, and he was unable to carry through on the attack. Suddenly, he felt the girls small, warm body press against him\n\n\"I am. Human\" she whispered into his ear \"feel that? That is my bodies heat\"\n\nAllen paused mid-attack\n\n\"You are human? You are like us? Then why?\"\n\nShe chuckled eerily, sending shivers up and down his spine\n\n\"Not quite like you\"\n\nShe grabbed his innocence and impaled herself with it. As his claws pierced her, he felt the innocence react to her like it reacted to the Akuma. She was the enemy there was no doubt about that. She pulled back, seemingly unbothered by her injuries, her skin knitting together in front of her eyes\n\n\"We Noah are nothing like you puny humans\" she hissed, driving one of the floating candles deep into his eye\n\nThe pain almost knocked him out but he battled through it- he had to save them. He had to save the all. He charged at the girl the weird pumpkin had called Rhode but she sent the remaining two Akuma after him. He knew there was no way he could take two level twos on by himself. In desperation, he touched the wand that still lay in his pocket but didnt withdraw it. Something told him he would be better to keep that weapon a secret for as long as possible. As qetly as possible he whispered \"protegro\" The shield charm caused them to deflect allowing him to catch one off guard. He sunk his claws deep into its armoured shell, gritting his teeth, pushing through the pain and digging them in as deep as possible. He felt them penetrate fully just before the other Akuma hit him from behind, flinging him across the room. The little girl screamed in anger as the Akuma he attacked exploded. Still yelling, her face twisted in anger, she swept her hand towards Miranda, sending all the spiked candles towards her at a furious speed. Without a second thought, Allen flung himself in front of them, wrapping his arms around her and whispering the shield charm again. He wasn't quite quick enough this time though and some of the candles pierced his body. Blood pooled around him and he looked numbly up at Miranda's terrified face\n\n\"It's ok\" he said reassuringly, forcing a smile \"you're going to be ok\" Rhode sent the final Akuma towards him and he tried hard to concentrate on staying conscious. His vision flickered worryingly as he fought to stay upright. He wasn't going to show any weakness- he wouldn't let her win. He was about to try one last act of defiance when he felt Miranda's thin arms wrap around his body. Her clock started glowing and he smiled slightly. Her innocence was activating. He body felt warm all over and the pain dissapitated. Hardly believing his eyes, he looked down to see his suit free of blood and puncture holes, even his eye was healed. He smiled as he looked up at Miranda\n\n\"You've saved us! Thank you\" ignoring her shocked face, he turned to face Rhode who was floating undecidedly outside the bubble Miranda had created. He made an angry swipe at her, missing just but before he could go any further, he remember Lenalee. He carefully released her from her chair and together they turned to face Rhode and the remaining Akuma. They fought like cornered lions but Rhode was powerful\n\n\"I have waited a long time to meet you Allen\" she purred languidly as she looked down on them \"you are the most interesting exorcist I have ever met\" Lenalee and Allen exchanged looks but he decided correcting her would not be in their best interests so he shook his head ever so slightly\n\n\"Akuma\" she chirped childishly \"you and your friends have been a huge disappointment to me today. Self destruct at the count of ten. Ten. Nine. Eight\" Allen looked in confusion between her and the Akuma\n\n\"I don't understand, what are you doing?\" Rhode leered at him as the pumpkin continued the countdown\n\n\"Did you know that if an Akuma is destroyed by anything but innocence, it devolves into dark matter, the soul doesn't escape\" Allen's eyes widened and he instinctively tightened his hand around his wand but the wand wasn't innocence- what if it just had the same effect? In an act of desperation, he flung himself at the Akuma but something caught him around the middle and right before his eyes, the final Akuma exploded and the soul dissapitated. Disappeared. Right before his eyes. In a fit of rage, he flew at Rhode who was disappearing through a door, he held the gun to her head, tears streaming down his face\n\n\"Tut tut Allen\" she sang \"crying over an Akuma? You'll never fit in if you carry on like this\" and she stepped though the door which snapped shut behind her. He stood staring numbly after her for a bit and then returned to Lenalee and Miranda. She was right. He would never fit in at the order. For a while there he had considered it- Mai could have stayed at Hogwarts- she would have been well looked after and he could have gone with the sweet, kind Lenalee and the timid Miranda, made a family, a home but he already had a family, a home. And they accepted him for who he was- an Akuma loving exorcist. Miranda reluctantly relinquished her power and the pain from his injuries hit him like a hammed blow, knocking the air out of his lungs and blackness started sneaking in at the edges of his vision but he knew he couldn't let go. Lenalee was planning to take him back to the order by force and he was in no shape to fight her. He wrapped his fingers around his wand again and whistled\n\n\"Accio broom\" under his breath while Lenalee was distracted. The broom, still under the disillusionment charm nudged him gently as it soared through the window. He disillusioned himself and wearily swung his leg over the broom, slumping down on it, trying to preserve what little strength he had left.\n\nThe blackness had more or less narrowed his vision to a pinprick when he came into view of the great dark castle. Hoping desperately that the Dementors were busy doing something else, he removed the disillusionment charm so that someone could find him when he eventually lost...\n\nHe came too bandaged up like a badly wrapped parcel in the hospital wing with Ron in the bed opposite him. The bored teenager quite willingly filled him in on all that had happened since he left\n\n\"You don't need to worry\" she said, seeing the worry on the small patch of Allen's face that wasn't swaddled in bandages\n\n\"No one even noticed you were missing with this whole Sirius debacle and it was Lupin who found you and he isn't about to say anything to anyone\" Allen sighed in relief and relaxed back against the cushion\n\nMadame Pomfrey came bustling in, scolding Ron for talking to him when he needed to preserve all his strength for healing\n\n\"What you have been up to I don't even want to thing about\" she muttered moodily as she slathered about twenty different types of ointment over each of the puncture wounds and bandaged them back up again\n\n\"Wounds the like of which I have never seen before nor would ever like to see again. Fool of a child\" still muttering, she bustled around the bed, doing everything within her power to make him comfortable despite her multiple threats to strap him to the bed and never let him up again\n\nAllen limped down the corridor, nervously looking over his shoulder to check for the matron but thankfully he seemed to be in the clear. He knocked politely on Lupins door and was ushered in with the usual smile and was forced to sit down before he collapsed. He was surprised to see Dumbledore standing at Lupins desk. He smiled warmly at Allen\n\n\"It's good to see you are well enough to get back to your usual rule breaking and meddling\" he said in a half serious and half teasing tone, his eyes twinkling mischievously. Allen smiled slightly and blushed\n\n\"It's ok though Allen, I have the feeling your here for the same reason I am. Maybe you will have more luck\" he waved his arm in Lupins direction and Allen turned to face him\n\n\"I don't want you to leave sir\" he blurted out without any preamble \"you saved my life, twice. Once with the Patronus and the other time when you found me. Pease don't go. You're the best teacher Hogwarts has ever seen\" Lupin smiled rather indulgently\n\n\"You're just lucky I found you as a human and not as a werewolf because believe me if I had found you as a werewolf, you would not be alive. But enough of this talk - I have a feelings you came to ask me something else\n\nAllen slowly began to re tell his adventure and both the adults listened intently to everything he said. By the end of the story Lupin looked distinctly green and the twinkle had dissapeared from Dumbledores eyes to be replaced by an intense sadness\n\n\"I should have saved that Akuma\" Allen whispered, tears splashing onto his bandages \"I should have been better. Faster\" Dumbledore reached over and placed a hand on his shoulder\n\n\"You can't save everyone Allen, the sooner you realise this the better. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try to save everyone, it just means you need to realise you won't be able to save everyone\" Allen turned his tortured eyes to Dumbledore\n\n\"But it is my job to save them. If I don't, who will?\" Dumbledore sighed heavily and crouched down\n\n\"If its any consolation, I have seen certain aspects of magic similar to this and I know that that Akuma's soul is not lost\" Allen gasped in disbelief and looked hopefully up again\n\n\"The dark matter as it was attacked with dark matter was not destroyed so yes, it is true that the soul is still trapped but if the dark matter that is used to trap souls is destroyed if it is wiped off the face of this earth I believe that all the souls trapped by the earl will be freed. If you destroy the means for making Akuma, then every Akuma will be saved\"\n\n\n\t36. Chapter 36\n\n**A/N- yeah, I know this is late- in my defence, this is my third draft, the app I tried to write it on really seemed to dislike it because it deleted it twice Twice! I was not pleased **\n\n**Arathelia- thank you, I really did struggle to come up with a way of them meeting without it being awkward. The rewinding town seemed the best idea because it meant Allen couldn't run away and Lenalee couldn't take him to the order. Glad you liked it though now I have to come up with a believable scenario for him meeting Kanda and Lavi :s**\n\n**Sonnenfrost- why thanks! I was really worried about how that bit would work out but yeah, I think imasked sense- Allen is perfectly happy where he is... For now... That may change in the future :P**\n\n**PoisonousDemon- I am so excited about going out! And things may chage, I'm sure if your determined enough you'll be angle to do something similar in the future- it doesn't need to be somewhere ads far as Ghana to be awesome! And yeah, I just needed to have that in. It made no sense to me that there would be a set up where okay the Akuma lucky enough to be killed by the right people would get to go free. Just seemed rather unfair.**\n\n**cowsaremyfriends49- oh yeah... Mind you, dean did sort of follow seamus's lead if I remember correctly but you are right :s oopsies!**\n\nAllen strode out into the sun washed grounds, taking a deep breath of the warm summer air and relishing the feeling of the sun on his face after being stuck in the infirmary for so long. Granted the only reason he had been allowed out from under Madame Pomfrey's hawk like gaze was because she had run out of herbs for his eye and she didn't have enough time to go get them herself but that was besides the point- for now at least, he was free. He wondered through the ground aimlessly, halfheartedly gazing about the ground as if hoping the plant would jump out at him and announce its presence. He was examining a rather likely looking clump of flowers when a familiar, lilting voice startled him\n\n\"Have you lost something?\" Came the unmistakable tones of Luna Lovegood. Allen turned and smiled in greeting\n\n\"Not exactly, Madame Pomfrey's sent me out to find some aconite for my eye\" he explained\n\n\"Oh, aconite? You'll never find that here. It likes lots of water\" Luna said matter of factly and caught his hand, pulling him down in the direction of the lake. Allen followed, his eyes wide with shock but even if he had wanted to pull away from her, he probably couldn't have managed- for all the size of her, she was strong enough. Besides, the easy way with which she had caught his hand had felt sort of natural. He suddenly realised that it was actually his cursed hand she was holding but before he could begin to worry that she would feel the leathery skin beneath his glove, she dropped his hand and knelt down. Allen curled his hand shut, the warm impression of her small hand still lingering there. He watched curiously as she rooted amongst a cluster of flowers, then held a bundle of blue blooms triumphantly to him.\n\n\"Hey, do you want me to take a look at your eye?\" She chirped \" Madame Pomfrey might discharge you earlier if I clean it up a bit before you go back\"\n\nAllen opened his mouth to say 'no' but somewhere between his brain and voice box, the signal went a bit squiffy and came out as\n\n\"Yeah, sure\"\n\nLuna beamed and ran down to the lake, conjuring up a bowl and filling it with water. She waved her wand over it as she walked back up, cleaning it. Allen knelt down in front of her so she could unravel the bandage. Thankfully by this stage his eye had regenerated enough that the hole Road had bored through it was healed over, however it still was swollen and oozed horribly. Luna seemed completely unperturbed by this and she simply cast a spell to clean the bandage then tore a strip off. She set the bowl down on the ground behind her with a few of the azure petals shredded in it and set it boiling cheerily with another spell. Turning back to face him, she started gently cleaning his eye. The warm sun beat down on the two teens, gently cooking them as they sat in a comfortable silence, broken only when Luna cleaned the bandage again. When she finished, she ordered him to lie down and set a section of the bandage, soaked in the flower infused water on his eye. She lay down beside him and a very welcome cool breeze whipped up the smell of baked grass and flowers around them.\n\n\"This is truly the most beautiful place in all the world\" Allen sighed contentedly, stretching his good arm out behind himself to use as a pillow. Luna hummed in agreement as she lazily chased Timcampy about with her hands- giggling every time she caught him. Tim seemed to enjoy this game as much as she did, fluttering teasingly in and out if her reach, his golden wings blazing in the sun\n\n\"It doesn't hurt that the dementors have gone now\" she said in her odd, childish voice \"the sun is always that much warmer after a cloud has passed over it\" the profound statement sounded strange coming from her, especially as she followed it up with\n\n\"Speaking of clouds, don't yo think that one there looks rather like a porcupine trying to eat a burger?\" In exactly the same tone. Allen was rather incoherent for a while as he laughed so hard, he nearly cracked his newly healed ribs. Luna gave him a rather perturbed look, as confused by him as he was by her. Allen tried to regain control of himself, alternating between laughing and groaning, with his bandaged arm wrapped around his ribs\n\n\"What actually happened to yo?\" Luna asked, looking curiously at his injuries\n\n\"Oh I had a falling out with the whomping willow\" Allen lied smoothly.\n\n\"I must have picked something up from the soil or bark though because my wounds seem very reluctant to heal\" he winced as his ribs gave him another pointed stab as if to prove his point. Luna looked rather unconvinced so Allen tried to distract her\n\n\"Where did you learn to heal so well?\" He questioned\n\n\"I was always a tomboy as a kid, so I got into a lot of scrapes\" she explained, still scrutinising him carefully \"I could hardly get my dad to magic me better every time so I learned a little muggle medicine\" she reached up and removed the makeshift poultice from his eye. The cool air felt nice on the swollen skin and Allen was glad she didn't bandage it up strait away. Instead she curiously traced his scar with a cool fingertip, a vaguely intrigued expression on her face.\n\n\"Allen\" she said eventually \"were you by any chance attacked by an Akuma when you were younger?\"\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nLenalee perched nervously on the edge of the seat, her back ramrod strait as she studied her brother, trying to figure out what was going through his mind but despite knowing him so well, she could make out nothing. Eventually he seemed to snap out of his trance and picked up a pen, placing it on the report sheet\n\n\"How did he manage to get away from you Lenalee? I have yet to meet someone who can move as quickly as you.\"\n\nLenalee sighed slightly. She felt incredibly guilty. Even though there was no way she could have stopped him- he had disappeared in the blink of an eye- she couldn't deny that she was glad he had got away. The way his face had softened when he spoke of her daughter, well, it had melted her heart. Komui nodded as she told him exactly what had happened, noting it all down. The scientist in him came to the surface as his eyes lit up with curiosity\n\n\"It must be some sort of cloaking device- I wonder if it is linked to a innocence or it something he made himself. One would imagine its not his innocence as it tends to either have just the one use or very similar uses- it is very unlikely that it would act as both a weapon and shield though we mustn't rule it out.\" He shook himself slightly and the soppy brother replaced the serious scientist \"How I go on. You must be exhausted sister dear, what was I thinking keeping you like that. Can't have you falling sick on us- go get some rest\" Lenalee turned to leave the room but she paused with her hand on the doorknob then, steeling herself, turned back\n\n\"Brother... If you... I mean if there had been some way... If it had been possible, theoretically of course, for you to have taken me away from the order and raise me outwith this place while still fighting against the Akuma, would you have\"\n\nThere was a painfully long silence and Lenalee began to regret asking the question. she wasn't even sure why she was asking it- it was just that she was sort of trying to justify her actions. Surely if her brother would have considered going down a similar road to Allen in order to protect her like he was trying to protect his daughter then maybe her sympathy for him was justified- her unwillingness to track him down and force him to join the order he hated so was not treacherous but understandable. Komui seemed to understand what she was getting at as well, a rather scrutinising light coming into his eye. He took her query seriously though and seemed to be struggling to come up with an answer but eventually he did reply\n\n\"My one and only goal in life is to keep you as safe and as happy as possible, whatever the means, although I am not strong enough to protect you from everything in this world, I will continue to do my best for you\" His eyes shone slightly as gazed intently at her, as if trying to out some meaning across that he couldn't say in words. She crossed the room and hugged him tightly whispering around the lump in her throat\n\n\"I know Komui, and I do feel safe, and I am happy. You have succeeded\" she turned on her heel and escaped the room before she burst into tears and upset him even more. Escaping out into the small courtyard she took a number of deep calming breaths, berating herself soundly for asking in the way she had. She hoped fervently that she hadn't made him feel like he had failed her as a brother- she knew that he had done everything he could have to help her but it was just playing on her mind- this idea that one could be an exorcist and fight for the good of mankind without being on the side of the order. She shook her head firmly and strode back inside, banishing the thoughts to the back of her mind. It was not even to be thought about. There was no way she could leave now. Not that she wanted to anyway.\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nAllen was never more grateful for the poker face he had perfected over the years as he was that day\n\n\"A what?\" He asked innocently, hiding his shock behind a smooth mask. His heart was going at a hundred miles an hour though and his brain had gone into a blind spin- how did she know about Akuma and what did she know about them?\n\n\"An Akuma\" she repeated more slowly, demolishing any hopes Allen held that he had just misheard her\n\n\"I've never heard of them before\" he said after pretending to think for a bit \"my scar is just from a backfired curse- it's a little like Harry's\" a drop of cold sweat worked its way uncomfortably between his shoulder blades as he struggled to keep his tone light and friendly. Luna however wasn't giving up so easily\n\n\"They leave marks like that pentagon when they attack\" she said, gesturing to his scar \"though usually people don't survive an attack by them. Maybe it's because you are a wizard- the only killings I've heard about were muggles\"\n\nAllen's mouth went dry\n\n\"W-who did you hear all this from?\" He queried, clenching his fist behind him, trying to relieve some of the tension that was billowing up inside him\n\n\"Oh, one of my dads contacts has a friend in Japan who witnessed an attack\" Luna said airily, thankfully seeming unaware of the stress she was inducing upon Allen. That statement however relieved the pressure and he relaxed in relief- it was just one person then, and not even someone she knew personally. He heaved an internal sigh of relief- still not letting anything slip on his calm mask. He figured he may as well use this opportunity to learn exactly what she knew though\n\n\"Well, thankfully I have never met one of them. What do they look like?\" He asked, forcing a tone of nochalance, as he stared out across the sparkling lake, feigning neutrality toward the conversation\n\n\"Well, according to our witness, they look like limbless elephants and they can fly. They are purple and can shoot fire out of their trunks and this fire if it touches you, spreads pentagons all over your skin and you die\" she said, completely serious. This time, Allen couldn't help but allow some of his emotions to slip on his face as he grinned to himself\n\n\"I'll certainly keep an eye out for them. I don't need any more scars thank you very much! This one is quite enough to be getting on with\" he said, rather teasingly. Luna seemed to pick up on his sarcasm but was as unfazed as usual by his disbelief.\n\n\"If you don't mind my asking, how exactly did you get your scar\" she said, flipping to her stomach and threading together a chain of the flowers closest to her. This effectively wiped the smirk off Allen's face, though the re-telling of his story was less painful this time round, which he supposed was a positive sign although it did still leave him with a horribly uncomfortable lump in his throat and his insides felt like they had twisted themselves into a huge knot. Luna slipped her hand back into his and gave it a rather supporting squeeze, saying nothing for a long time. They both stared out silently at the failing sunlight as it played on the surface of the lake rather tiredly, as if it were worn out from a days good work. Eventually Luna broke the silence- she said nothing of his experience, but rather told him of hers- putting herself in the same vulnerable position that he had out himself in, which though it did not stop the pain, it did make it somewhat more bearable. Once the sun had completely given up the ghost, they rose to go back inside- prompted partly by the cold and partly by the loud complainings of Allen's stomach. Luna reached up and caught Timcampy as they made their way back to the school and set a small ring of daisies on his head before releasing him. Allen smiled as Tim fluttered about excitedly before settling on Luna's head. She grinned at this and shot Allen a rather smug look\n\n\"I think I am his new favourite\" she sang, skipping about in fron of him and sticking her tongue out childishly. Allen made a face back at her and scowled at his treacherous companion\n\n\"You know, no one believes golems exist\" Luna said, shooting a sideways glance at Allen. \"There have only ever been eyewitness accounts so the ministry refuse to make them officially a magical creature\" Allen gave her a rather confused look\n\n\"But I have one here- or haven't you noticed yet? Here's a hint- he is perched on your head\" Luna wrinkled her nose at his heavily sarcastic tone\n\n\"Yeah well, my dad and I wanted to take him to the ministry to prove their existence or interview you as an eyewitness and owner but Dumbledore wouldn't let us. He is very protective you know. He said that it would be beyond cruel to force you to part with your pet which would undoubtably happen if the ministry caught wind that you had an incredibly rare animal\" she gave him a rather piercing stare then, walking backwards so he was facing her and couldn't really escape her gaze\n\n\"I'm only saying- just because a creature hasn't been examined by the ministers doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It just takes one one two eyewitnesses to come forward...\" She trailed off pointedly but to his relief, she left it there, wrapping his eye up quickly in his bandage just before they entered the hall and walked separate ways to their separate tables.\n\n\n\t37. Chapter 37\n\n**A/N: So... hey again... apologies for that long break... life happened :P But I'm back! Back with a long(ish) chappy full of plot developing, Kanda and Lavi :D please forgive me**\n\n**Oh ps, I have a very mean boy make some rather ignorant comments in the chapter- his words, not mine!**\n\nRoad silently crept along the wall of the room behind the Millenium Earl's rocking chair before leaping up to hug him over the back of the chair\n\n\"~good-afternoon Millenie!~\" She chirped cheerfully as the momentum of her attack set the chair swinging violently backwards and forwards. The Millenium Earl chuckled indulgently\n\n\"Why, good-evening to you too Road, and don't you sound happy- is that fresh blood I smell?\" Road giggled uncontrollably as she slid down onto his lap and licked her lips in pleasure\n\n\"Thanks for the toys! It's been a while since I have had the pleasure of tasting exorcist blood. This one was odd though- he wasn't wearing that detestable uniform and he had a scarred eye that could see the souls of Akuma. He made a fabulous toy though- promise me Millenie? Promise me I will be allowed to kill this one?\" The Millennium Earl joined in with her crazed laughter\n\n\"Of course my pet- once my plan is set into motion, you can kill as many as you like- but now to serious business Road- there have been whispers in some circles that the nuisance Tom Riddle did not die in his quest for immortality I need you to determine whether or not these rumours are true. We still owe that piece of scum and you know I cannot break the vow I made with him unless he truly is dead\" Road's childish smile was replaced by a distinctly darker one\n\n\"That piece of filth! I thought we were rid of him once and for all. How I would love to crush his pathetic human skull\" Her eyes glowed with a positively demonic light and the temperature of the room dropped by a number of degrees. The Earl continued on unperturbed by her anger\n\n\"Come now Road, you know if it wasn't for him, our family would still be incomplete. The sacrifice we made was worth it- our knowledge about souls in exchange for wizards bodies, the only things capable of holding the Noah memories without bursting. I would happily allow you to kill the scum however he was not as stupid as most humans and the unbreakable vow is as true as its name- although I doubt it would kill me, it is certainly powerful enough to cause me significant harm and I cannot allow that just as my plan is about to come together\" The Earl grimaced in anger as he remembered that fateful day when a HUMAN- a stinking creation from the God he detested so much- got the better of him. He snarled as he remembered the smug look on that snake-like man as he drawled in a sickeningly superior voice\n\n\"A simple exchange earl- you tell me all you know about souls and binding rituals and in return, I shall offer you up some of my faithful followers to act as vessels for your lost family members\"\n\nThe only thing that had stopped the Earl from dismembering him on the spot was the tantalising hope that he could somehow restore his family once more. He needed them, his entire plan hinged on them- they were essential to his rise to power and only Road had been left to him. She- so distraught by the loss of her family and betrayal of her closest friend- spent the majority of her time deep within her world of dreams and so was as good as lost to him too\n\n\"How do you know your wizarding bodies will be any more suitable to host the memory of a Noah than human ones\" He spat, his hand tightly wrapped around his sword, ready to cleave the pale man in two if the answer was not adequate\n\n\"I don't but I equally don't know if your knowledge will be of any use to me. It is a gamble on both sides but it is one I am willing to take. The knowledge is valuable enough to me that any gamble- no matter how improbable is worth it. Tell me, do you not feel the same way about your missing family members?\"\n\nThe Earl half-mad with fury at the taunting tone swung his sword at the mans neck, however before the blow could hit home, the blade halted. The Earl froze in confusion and the pale man turned his emotionless face to the Earl\n\n\"We are not as weak as the humans you are used to dealing with\"\n\nThe Earl returned his blade to its sheath- the man had a point. He clearly was different from most humans. Perhaps this was a gamble worth taking\n\n\"How did you hear about us? And what makes you so sure your followers will offer up their lives to you?\"\n\nThe pale man laughed a cold, empty laugh at this\n\n\"My followers will do anything I command them to, no questions asked- come now, surely someone such as you would understand? I'm sure none of your subordinates would ever act outwith your commands\" The Earl gritted his teeth at the smug smirk that tugged at the corner of the creatures thin lips\n\n\"As to where I learned all this, during my search for this knowledge, I heard of a half-mad clown that claimed to know about a family who tampered with the very souls of the dearly departed. Unlike the others who dismissed his story's as garbage, I decided it was worth hearing. He was unwilling to talk at first but after a friendly drink, he seemed unable to stop from answering every question I had for him. I followed up on the things he told me and it led me here. So tell me, Millenium Earl, do we have a deal? Your knowledge in exchange for a chance to have your family back?\"\n\nSilence reigned over the room while the Earl deliberated within himself and all of a sudden, Road, who had remained silent throughout the whole exchange plucked at his sleeve\n\n\"You must\" She whispered, in a barely audible voice\n\n\"You must. The family must be completed, no matter the cost. You must.\" Then in an even smaller voice \"Please\"\n\nHe knew he had no choice. He needed his family of Noah to fulfil his plans for this world- He needed an assured victory over the Order and even with all his power he knew that he could not stand alone against all of the generals. He needed his bishops and knights back- this game could not be played solely with pawns.\n\n\"Fine. I agree.\" He spat between clenched teeth\n\n\"Ah-ah\" admonished the wizard \"Not so quickly- do you think I would be so foolish as to simply trust your word? We shall make an unbreakable vow- if either party breaks their half of the bargain, they die.\"\n\nThe Earl nodded and Voldemort gestured to a Death Eater than had been hiding behind him the entire time. He and the Earl gripped each others arms and the two opponents locked gaze, the intensity in both their eyes blazing with a furious heat\n\n\"Will you, Tom Marvelo Riddle swear to pledge one wizard for every lost member of the Noah clan?\" The trembling servant stuttered, his wand lightly touching the joined enemies\n\n\"I will\" Voldemort said, calmly, only a brief flash of fire lighting his eyes at the mention of his detested name\n\n\"And shall you, Sennen Hakushaku swear to share your knowledge pertaining to the workings of and binding of human souls with Tom Marvello Riddle?\"\n\n\"I will\" pledged the Earl, with only the briefest hesitation. He released his grip, however, Voldemort held on\n\n\"Will you, Sennen Hakushaku swear to leave the pure-blooded wizarding community out of your plans for destruction?\" The trembling wizard continued\n\nThe Earls eyes bugged\n\n\"That was not part of the deal\" He snarled\n\n\"Will you pull away, making the vow void?\" Voldemort countered \"If you do this, I will even make another valuable vow- I shall prevent knowledge of the Noah clan and Akuma from ever reaching the Wizarding community until it is no longer possible for the well meaning fools to try and stop you\"\n\nA long, silence filled the room until eventually\n\n\"I will\"\n\nThe Earl clenched his fist in fury as he remembered the humiliating experience of having a human play him for a fool. He thought that he was free of the scum however if the rumours were to be believed...\n\n\"No my child, we shall bide our time and keep our word to leave the wizarding community alone. They have their own battle to fight so we shall wait and allow them to kill each other off then once the order has been overthrown and the heart is ours, we shall crush them like the ants they are!\"\n\nA wide grin stretched across Roads face\n\n\"Yes. We shall crush them\"\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nHarry and Allen sat side-by-side on a faded swing set as they tried to coax a cool breeze, swinging lazily back and forwards.\n\n\"I'd better make the most of the sunshine while I can\" Allen said light-heartedly, tilting his pale face up to catch the sun\n\n\"Yeah, where was it you said you were heading?\" Harry asked lazily\n\n\"A small town in greenland\" Allen answered, nervously tugging his hood down as a crowd of children ran laughing past with their bedraggled parents following wearily behind\n\n\"They have been experiencing weird weather and the order believe its due to Innocence. The main reason though is that Kanda and Lavi- the two exorcists I have yet to meet- are on this mission. Dumbledore says its perfect, the weather will prevent them from calling in back up and will give me a good opportunity to talk to them uninterrupted. I need to try and build up some relation with them if I am to have their trust when I join the order later\"\n\nHarry frowned miserably at this. He still was not at all pleased with Allen's decision to join the order once he graduated. Unfortunately, Allen had pretty great arguments to back his decision up- the order were the only organisation out there actually attempting to stop the Earl and if Allen ever wished to stop him, he needed to join them but despite all the logical arguments for this decision, Harry couldn't help the irrational part of him that wanted Allen to stay. The sacrifices he was having to make simply because he was unlucky enough to be born with innocence just seemed unfair. He had decided- after spending a year vehemently refusing to even consider it- to send Mai away to a normal school and despite all he had told them about the underhand ways of the order, he had decided to join them. It just seemed so unfair the position that he had been put in. Harry just hoped that if he ever needed to make such a sacrificial decision for the greater good of the world, he would be able to do it with as much grace as Allen was\n\n\"We still haven't really decided how we are going to broach the whole 'wizard' thing yet though. Dumbledore is working on the ministry at the moment, trying to convince them that my story is true and to talk them into approaching the Order offering an alliance however they are as stubbornly blind as ever\" he rolled his eyes in irritation and shrugged one shoulder uselessly\n\n\"Still, they can't deny it forever. Soon the Earls plan is going to come into play and we will not have the luxury of ignorance\" He looked rather glum at that and Harry desperately cast around for a topic that would distract him from the current conversation. Simply because his mind had been playing on it so much recently, the first thing he came up with was the recurrent nightmares he had been having. He felt a bit stupid as he explained that he couldn't remember anything about them but there was just a nagging feeling in his gut that they were important. Allen, however took it seriously and fell quiet for a few minutes\n\n\"Well, there's nothing you can do to force yourself to remember the dream\" He said eventually \"You will just have to trust that if it truly is important then eventually you will remember it. Just keep your guard up right? Trust your gut- if something doesn't feel right trust your instincts and you know you always have your friends about to save your idiotic bakside if you do your usual and walk strait into trouble\" He stuck his tongue out teasingly at his friend who moodily pulled a face in response. The rest of the day passed as nicely as it could have. Once Mai grew bored of the park, they found a little stream and cooled off in there, settling down for a pik-nik in a stony island in the middle of a wider section much to Mai's delight. The sun soon dried them off and once the it began to loose some of its intensity, they dared to emerge from the shade and return to the park. Harry and Allen returned to the swing set and were chatting away obliviously when a harsh voice came from behind them\n\n\"Who's this Harry? Your _boyfriend_?\"\n\nAllen and Harry both turned around to find Dudley and his crew of faithful followers standing in a semi-circle behind them\n\n\"I take it this one is that delightful cousin you have told me so much about\" Allen said cooly, jerking his thumb toward Dudley. Harry nodded miserably and with something of a mischievous smirk, Allen tugged down his hood, revealing his snow- white hair and red scar\n\n\"Its a pleasure to meet you Dudley, my name is Allen Walker. I'm a classmate of your cousin\" Harry chuckled internally as each of the boys eyes widened at Allen's strange appearance and they all uniformly took a step backwards\n\n\"What the * £ ( is wrong with your face?!\" one of the boys yelped in shock. Allen's eyes widened innocently\n\n\"Why? Do I have something on it? I _did_ eat a custard donut for lunch...\" He turned to Harry \"Is there something there?\" He asked in mock concern. The boys- it seemed- did not appreciate his humour\n\n\"Shut it freak! You two are just as deformed as each other\" he spat\n\n\"What?!\" Allen cried in indignation \"I will have you know I far surpass Harry in my freakishness! Look at this hair! And my scar is three times as big as his- no offence Harry, but come on, that thing is a pitiful excuse for a scar\" Harry sighed in resignation\n\n\"Its true, as hard as I try, I just fall short of your freak standard\" Allen laughed lightly and petted his head condicendingly\n\n\"Just keep striving- I'm sure you'll get there one day\"\n\nThe banter seemed to be confusing the thick-heads and they- unable to follow the conversation- returned it to a level they could understand\n\n\"Shut it you gaylords! Sitting side by side on the swings, what a cute couple you make\" Snorting laughter echoed around the circle and Dudley finally gained the confidence to join in\n\n\"Didn't realise you swung that way Harry- always knew there was something wrong with you- not that any self-respecting girl would fall for you anyway. I guess this freak was as good as you could do\" He slapped high fives with his friends and chortled triumphantly. Allen coolly raised one eye-brow, clearly un-impressed by this display\n\n\"What original and hurtful insults you all come up with- truly you have hurt me to the core. Come to think of it\" he said thoughtfully to Harry \" I've never really understood why gay is an insult, I mean its just a descriptive term- like either its true in which case its like saying 'shut up, you brunette' or its not true in which case, it really fails as an insult and just makes you look stupid\" Dudleys lip curled angrily\n\n\"Did you just call me stupid you little shrimp?\" He snarled, raising a fist however at that opportune moment, Mai trotted up the them, clearly frightened by what was going on. She tugged at Allen's sleeve\n\n\"Papa, whats happening?\" Allen scooped her up and placed a kiss gently on her forehead\n\n\"Don't worry about it princess. These people here were just demonstrating to us the problem with todays society- incidentally, life lesson, ignorance may be bliss for you but all it does is hurt those around you. Plus it make you look like a fool\" Dudley had frozen mid-swing and seemed unsure about what to do. Allen stood up and bowed slightly to them\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, I really need to get my daughter to bed\" he bent down and gave Harry a one-armed hug \"See you in school!\" He turned and walked away however it seemed that Dudley's gang weren't about to let him off with humiliating them and one stooped to pick up a rock and flung it at the receding figure. Almost inhumanly, Allen lent to one side, and the rock soared past his ear and without even turning to acknowledge it he raised his hand to give a jaunty farewell wave\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nAllen ran full pelt towards the stone bridge, his heart pounding in his chest. He twisted around, not slowing down at all. The train hadn't passed yet- thank goodness. He gripped his pocket ensuring that Timcampy was still there and swung his legs over the bridge, his suitcase clutched tight in his hand. There was a rush of wind and all of a sudden, the brown roof of the train was thundering beneath his feet. He silently sent a prayer up to heaven and threw himself off. For a gut wrenching moment the speed of the train almost threw him off however his boots eventually caught grip and halted his momentum. He was dimly aware of two other thumps on the train roof however he was too busy mentally checking that each limb was still attatched to his body to pay it much heed. After his heart realised he hadn't killed himself and began beating again, he slowly straitened up and turned to try and find an entrance into the carriage and that was when he spotted them. A red-haired boy with an eyepatch staring at him with undisguised shock and a tall dark-haired man looking as uninterested and disgruntled as it was possible to look. Allen sheepishly grinned and waved, slowly making his way over to the two\n\n\"I guess I'm not the only one who was running late, huh?\" he said lightheartedly. The red-head laughed however a glint appeared in the dark-haired ones eyes and in one fluid movement, he drew his sword. Allen leapt back with a yelp as the crazy wannabe samurai took a sweep at his head. His companion seemed as shocked as Allen\n\n\"What are you doing Yuu?\" he yelled as Kanda pushed his attack further, forcing Allen to retrete. He 'tsk'd' in irritation at the question\n\n\"Dont _call_ me that- and if you can't tell why you are more stupid than I thought. Look at him. Its that brat Lena lee lost in the last mission\" Allen bristled at the name brat\n\n\"Hey- I'm not a brat you wannabe samurai!\" Those two must be Lavi and Kanda then though he had guessed as much going on the description he had received from Lenalee in the rewinding town plus the fact they had survived hurling themselves at a moving train\n\n\"Even if it is, why are you attacking him?\" Lavi protested, ignoring Allen's indignation. Kanda shrugged lightly and took another swipe at the small boy, who fell to the ground just in time to miss having a chunk taken out of his arm. He hurriedly flipped back to his feet and resigning himself to having to fight, he activated his innocence\n\n\"We have our orders to capture him. He managed to escape Lenalee before so I figure if we maim him a little, he'll be unable to escape\" He said, his face completely emotionless, as if he was talking about nothing more important than what he would like for dinner. Lavi sighed\n\n\"We are on a mission Kanda- what do you expect us to do with an injured exorcist? Carry him around with us the whole time? Think this through!\" Kanda it seemed though was unwilling to listen and charged at Allen again. This time however, Allen was ready for him. It was obvious that he was not going to stop the attack so there was no point in trying to talk him down. They struck a strange picture- Three figures on the roof of a train, their cloaks and coats billowing around them, the wind clawing at their hair and clothing as if it too wished to joint the battle. Allen and Kanda flew at each other- claw and sword clashing while Lavi stood a good few steps away, observing the battle in exasperation\n\n\"Yuu! Stop this!\" He yelled again as mugen swung dangerously close to Allen's chest\n\n\"We can take him on the mission with us instead and take him to the order afterwards\"\n\n\"What!\" Spat both Kanda and Allen\n\n\"You're not taking me anywhere!\" Allen yelled, over the turbulent wind, taking advantage of the distraction and upgraded his innocence to the gun shape, activating the glowing gold bade and locking swords with Kanda.\n\n\"How exactly are you planning on preventing him from escaping genius?\" Kanda spat as the two wrestled back and forward. Lavi reached into his backpack and pulled out a black collar\n\n\"Its a new invention of the orders- trust me. It'll work. Keep him still\"\n\nAllen's eyes widened in fear but he was unable to escape, if he tried to unlock blades with Kanda, he would probably lose a leg. Lavi approached at the side of the locked pair\n\n\"Sorry about this!\" He said cheerily before snapping the collar on around Allen's neck and slipping the leather bracelet it was connected to over his own wrist\n\n\"OK, let him go now Yuu\" He said firmly. Kanda gritted his teeth but eventually he broke the glaring match between him and the shrimp and swung his blade around, almost clipping Lavi's fringe as he did so\n\n\"Don't _call_ me that Baka Usagi\" He snarled before staking off the the trapdoor in the roof of the train and dropping into the carriage below. It had taken all of Allen's strength to hold off the phsyco man and his arm was trembling from exertion. He deactivated it and pushed himself up onto his feet again\n\n\"Thanks\" He said with a small smile \"I'm not sure how much longer I could have lasted against him! Plus I really didn't want to injure anyone- The order would send out a witch hunt if I did!\" Lavi raised an eyebrow in surprise\n\n\"You're taking this awfully well\" He said, jingling the chain that joined them. Allen smiled innocently\n\n\"Oh trust me, I have no intentions whatsoever of going to the order, however I was planning on helping you with this mission anyway so...\" He shrugged lightly. Lavi smiled equally innocently in return\n\n\"You may find it harder to escape than you think. He smirked internally as he saw a flash of doubt enter the smaller boys eyes\n\n\"Let's go\" He said, tugging gently on the collar as he walked toward the trapdoor\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nAllen gazed wide-eyed around the lush carriage- the order sure travelled in style! Lavi sat down opposite Kanda who didn't even glance up from the pile of paper he was flicking through. A tik appeared above Allen's eye- Kanda's entire attitude just ticked him off! He had just tried to half-kill him with no provocation whatsoever and now he was just ignoring him entirely. He sat down with a huff of irritation next to Lavi, quietly grateful that he was attached to him rather than the phsyco samurai. Lavi sighed contentedly as he wriggled comfortably in the cushioned seats \"This is so much better than the roof\" He said teasingly, watching Kanda out of the corner of his eye for some reaction however he got nothing. He rolled his eye and grinned at Allen, who was looking somewhat dishevelled after his ordeal\n\n\"You get used to him after a while, he does have a heart in that hard chest of his... somewhere..\"\n\nKanda tsk'd in annoyance and shot Lavi a glare over the top of his papers\n\n\"Quit your blathering or I will cut you\" He hissed icily\n\nAllen glanced at Lavi disbelievingly\n\n\"He does I swear! Deeeeep deeeeep down... Anyways Allen, I'm curious, how did you find out about this mission?\" Allen's pocket squirmed at this and out burst Timcampy, he whirred excitedly around the compartment a few times before settling eventually in his usual perch on his masters head. Allen laughed lightly\n\n\"I guess that answers that question! I came across Tim a few years ago and he's been a faithful friend since\"\n\nLavi cocked his head on one side\n\n\"Really? That's odd. Golem's have no emotions, their one and only purpose is to serve the order. I've never heard of one going rogue before\" He leaned forward curiously to study the golden golem, however it seemed Tim did not appreciate the red-head sticking his face so close to his and he clamped his formidable teeth down on his nose. Lavi yelped in pain and fell backwards, the chain connecting him to Allen snapped taught and with a cry Allen flew through the air colliding heavily with Kanda's knee on his way to the floor causing the papers to fly out of his grip and explode over the compartment like oversized snowflakes. The door opened and one of the conductors walked through, curious about the noise. He froze in disbelief at the scene before him- The compartment was covered in sheets of white paper and a red headed boy was lying on the floor, connected by a chain to a white-haired boy who was sprawled across his chest, gripping tightly onto the arm of his furious dark-haired companion in a vain attempt to stop him from bringing the sword he had clutched in his hands down on the two of them\n\n\"Err... pardon the intrusion... I was just, err, checking to see if you needed refreshments however I see you are busy, I'll come back another time!\" He stuttered but before he could leave the strange white haired one called him back\n\n\"No wait! I'd love some food!\" His stomach growled loudly as if to emphasise the point and he chuckled sheepishly\n\nAfter leaving the compartment, the conductor leaned wearily against the door. He had never heard someone order as much food as that skinny little kid did and as to why he was chained to the red-head he didn't think he even wanted to know. He would send one of the lower-down employees with the food, suff first-class service, he didn't want to go back into that compartment ever again!\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\n\"That's amazing!\" Lavi gasped watching wide-eyed as Allen polished off the last plate of food and settled beck in his seat with a sigh of contentment. Kanda merely snorted and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like 'revolting' under his breath. Allen glared at him but said nothing of it\n\n\"Yeah, my appetite has always been pretty huge\" He laughed, rubbing the back of his head shyly\n\n\"It must be because your innocence is parasitic type\" Lavi said, gesturing to Allen's arm\n\n\"I haven't seen anything like it before- I've heard of parasitic type but as far as I know, none of our exorcists are parasitic. How did you get it?\" Allen shrugged\n\n\"I was born with it I guess... Its been there as long as I remember but I never knew my parents so I couldn't exactly ask\"\n\n\"Can I see?\" Lavi asked curiously, reaching out for Allen's arm but Allen flinched away instinctively, raising his other arm to block Lavi, his grey eyes all of a sudden becoming more guarded. Kanda stopped passively watching the scenery flying past the train window to watch the drama unfolding before him with the slightest hint of curiosity. Allen held his guarded stance for a few minutes before relaxing slightly and nodding\n\n\"My apologies. Of course\" He slipped his white glove off and rolled up his sleeve to reveal the disfigured arm. His eyes still guarded and cloudy, he held it out for inspection\n\n\"Sugoi!(1)\" Lavi breathed, his eyes hungrily taking in every detail. He gently took Allen's hand in his and traced the outline of the innocence with his finger, moving slowly so as not to spook the young teen who looked ready to bolt at any sudden movement\n\n\"Revolting\" Kanda sneered. Allen jumped at the venomous tone and slipped his hand out of Lavi's, pulling his glove on again and tugging the sleeve down. His usually pale cheeks flushed dark red and he seemed unwilling to raise his eyes from the floor\n\n\"Yuu!\" Lavi yelled, surprised by the anger in his own voice \"Take that back\"\n\nKanda snorted disparagingly \"Not a chance. You keep your distance from me, short-stack\" Weak people irritated him more than anything else in the world. The tiny, weak kid's nervous nature touched a nerve with him and made him want to kill him himself before he had to go on a mission with the kid and end up endangering everyones life in a vain attempt to make up for his incompetence\n\n\"My name is Allen, Bakanda and if you think I would ever willingly spend time with someone as narrow minded as yourself, your wrong!\" Allen spat, his eyes blazing with anger\n\n\"Woah\" Lavi muttered, shrinking down at the dark energy that was emitting from both Allen and Kanda\n\n\"What. Did. You. Just. Call. Me?\" Kanda spat out between clenched teeth, his hand straying to Mugen again\n\n\"What, are you deaf as well as stupid? I called you Ba-kan-da\" Allen repeated, drawing each syllable out pointedly. Lavi laughed at this new nick-name but his laughter died in his throat when Kanda turned his glare onto him. He shrunk down in his seat\n\n\"Now now, lets all just try and keep our cool ok?\" He nervously piped up, waving his hands calmingly at the two. They both sank back down into their seats and folded their arms, glaring huffily in opposite directions. Lavi heaved a sigh of relief and celebrated internally- not only did he finally have the chance to meet and record information on the elusive 'Allen Walker' he also had found someone that had more success in drawing Kanda out of his stoic shell than even he did! This was going to be an amazing mission...\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nAllen silently cheered when Lavi- who it turned out was impossible to shut up- finally stopped talking and fell asleep. He snuck a peek at Kanda but he too seemed out of it. Once he was sure that no one would see him, he began tugging that the collar around his neck. It seemed to have sealed seamlessly around his neck- he couldn't find any buckle or join in the black leather. He hooked one of his claws in under the leather and tried to saw his way through the material- If he worked on it on the inside of the collar ever night, they wouldn't notice and he's be able to just snap it on the last day and sneak out however, despite his best efforts, the material seemed to be impenetrable. Timcampy joined in his efforts and chewed at the band however he had just as little success. He let out a huff of irritation and slumped back in his seat, glowering at the sleeping boy beside him and if he didn't know better, he could have sworn he saw him smile smugly.\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-\n\nAllen yelped in pain as Lavi fell down in the snow, causing the chain that connected them to tighten and Allen to lose his balance. The two struggled to their feet again (Allen muttering under his breath about useless rabbits) and tried to catch up to Kanda's receding figure- he of course waited for no man. They had just come level with him again when Allen spotted two figures lying in the snow. He started to run over to them but once again, the chain round his neck snapped tight, halting him mid-run. He and Lavi helped the two travellers to their feet and offered to bring them to the nearby cabin but Kanda refused to be waylaid from his mission and carried on without them. Allen couldn't help but feel rather smug when it turned out that the two they rescued led to some vital information about the whereabouts of the innocence however, by the time they had uncovered this, it was too dark to consider going out again so they decided to stay the night. The women who owned the inn had initially been too busy with the two half-frozen travellers to pay much attention to the exorcists but now that they were taken care of, she could help but let her curiosity get the better of her\n\n\"And what about you two?\" She asked. Both Allen and Lavi looked at her innocently as if to say 'what do you mean' so she decided to try a more direct approach\n\n\"Why are you looking for the leaves of revival? What on earth happened to you\" she gestured to Allen \"and why on earth are you chained together?\" The two boys exchanged looks and laughed rather nervously\n\n\"Well... to tell you the truth, its a rather long story\" Lavi said\n\n\"We're exorcists\" Allen chimed in, lying smoothly \"We know what is the cause of all this strange weather and we are on a mission to stop it. As for what happened to me, I was in a bad accident as a child I lost my parents and that was where I got my scar- the trauma caused my hair to go white. Lavi and I are chained together because Lavi here is my protector! In the Order, they truly value the lives of their younger members so with dangerous missions they send them out with a more experienced member. He is basically my bodyguard\" He smiled sweetly at the old lady and Lavi could practically see her heart melting at his tale. He smirked inwardly at the way Allen dealt with the situation- who would have known that despite his innocent aura, Allen was actually a talented lier!\n\n\"You're younger than him?\" The lady asked, looking rather surprised\n\n\"Oh yes\" Allen chirped \"I'm only 14 years old (2) It's my hair you see, makes me look older than I really am\" Lavi started slightly at this piece of information- the kid really was much younger than he had expected- and to think that he had managed to hold his own against Kanda even if it was just for a short time. The old lady, utterly charmed by Allen's sweet act gave them both a room for free. She bustled in and out, stoking up the fire and handing them extra blankets before bidding them a good night and leaving. Allen stared despondently at the double bed in the middle of the room\n\n\"This is NOT how I expected my very first mission would go\" He pouted, tugging at the collar around his neck. Lavi merely laughed at him\n\n\"Quit your whining. I'm exhausted\" He dug through his suitcase and changed into his pyjama's completely ignoring his companions awkwardness and once Allen had changed too,they climbed into the bed, doing their utmost to stop the chain from getting tangled\n\n\"Night Moyashi\" Lavi smirked, ignoring Allen's growl of irritation\n\n-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0\n\n**(1) Japanese for Amazing!**\n\n**(2) Yes, I realise I am screwing with the timeline but I need to! I didn't really realise how hard it was going to be to fit everything I want to into the proper timeline so I am messing with it. Deal.**\n\n**Oh and if you remember, Allen skipped a year of school, hence the reason he is younger than Harry**\n\n**Promise to update soon**\n\n**ciao :D**\n\n**P.S You're welcome Deaven ;) You're welcome!**\n\n\n\t38. Chapter 38\n\n**A/N: OK, so I am sort of backtracking a little in this chapter- for those of you who have been with this story for a while, you'll remember that I didn't want Cross to feature in the story. That, as it turns out, was not a good move so... yeah... I don't know if I'll re-write bits of the other chapters. I think I managed to write him in in an OK way but just tell me if you think I need to alter anything kay? Also- I will at some stage edit the last chappy. Allen is 13 not 14. Got confused with the age english people start school :S**\n\n**Also as a warning, I have been going waaay to slowly with this story so I think I'm going to try speeding things up in the upcoming chapters otherwise I will be writing this forever!**\n\n**Sakurakoi- Welcome to this story! And thanks so much for all those reviews, they made me chuckle quite a bit :D**\n\n**Scarlet- *meeeeeeep* OK... I updated!**\n\n**TheReadingDevil- *Runs and hides under her bed shaking like a leaf***\n\n**nooooooooooo anything but slenderman**\n\n**I updated kay? Please don't kill me *sniff sniff***\n\n\"No. Freaking. Way\" Allen stated firmly, glaring mistrustfully at the wooden ski's Lavi was waving cheerily in his face  \n>\"There is no way I am going to try skiing with a freaking chain attached to my neck- If either of us falls, it'll behead me!\" He continued, backing away as Lavi advanced, still brandishing the death traps<br>'Aw, don't you trust me to keep you safe Moyashi?\" He teased, his green eyes sparkling mischievously  \n>\"I'm afraid I don't really\" Allen stated bluntly, crossing his arms stubbornly. Lavi pouted at this<br>\"What!?\" He wailed despondently, tears streaming dramatically from his eyes as he fell to his knees \"so...cold...\" He whined, holding a trembling hand out to Allen. Allen rolled his eyes exasperatedly, hauling the whimpering teen to his feet, trying to bite back the smile that was tugging at his lips  \n>\"There's no need to be so dramatic\" He said, smiling lightly \"I would just prefer to keep my head attached to my shoulders so I'm sorry, but I really don't feel safe traveling on that... contraption\" he glanced at the ski's with the slightest hint of distain in his eyes. Lavi raised one eyebrow slightly<br>\"You know for a kid, you sure do talk weird\" He laughed, ruffling his companions hair \"And there's no need to be quite so melodramatic- if either of us is in mortal danger, the collar automatically detaches and I promise if any Akuma happen to appear, I will release it. It would be a pain to transport a corpse back to the Order\" He added teasingly \"Even if it is just a teeny, bean-sprout-sized one\" Allen glowered at him but said nothing, quietly storing away the information on the collar for later- so there was a way to sever the leather ring... Now all he needed to do was survive long enough to make use of the information. He looked nervously at the ski's again and sent a silent prayer up- he really couldn't delay it any more, they were just wasting precious daylight  \n>\"OK, I'll do it\" He said rather reluctantly, ignoring Lavi's triumphant grin and stepping onto the wooden death traps, wrapping his arms tight around Lavi's waist<br>\"I would really appreciate it if you tried not to make any sharp turns- my feet aren't strapped in and AAAAAAAARGH!\" He tightened his hold and squeezed his eyes shut as Lavi launched them without warning down the steep hill, blasting a path through the snow, sending up sheets of ice up on either side of the pair as they hurtled at breakneck speed downwards. Lavi laughed manically at Allen's wail and just lent forward further, speeding them up even more. His plan was simple- wind Allen up as much as possible until that smooth mask of his cracked down the centre! He hadn't expected Allen to be quite so adapt at his poker face- it rivalled even Lavi's. He hadn't been able to sneak in behind his defences at all and every sly question was deflected masterfully. It was all very frustrating, usually the happy-go-lucky persona he put on made people relax and open up to him as they did not consider him a threat. It had never failed before- unless you counted Kanda- but for some reason this kid was evading his skills like a master however, he was a bookman and there was no way he was going to be defeated in an interrogation competition- he was chained to the kid for crying out loud! If he couldn't get information with an advantage like that the really, what sort of bookman would he be? He would just have to keep up this friendly, hyper act until the kid relaxed and once his defences were down, he would pounce! It wouldn't really be all that hard- he got on quite well with Allen anyway and he intrigued him which just made him more curious about his story. There was no way he was going to be defeated by a beansprout of a kid, that was for sure!  \n>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>Allen winced as he got up from their third fall of the day. He sighed long-sufferingly- it wasn't even lunch yet and he already felt as if he had been run over repeatedly by an obese elephant! He payed no heed as Lavi bounded his way over to where he had finally landed after being catapulted off the ski's and clipped his collar on again. He turned this way and that, trying to determine the direction of the warm wind- they had two options up ahead, one path led up a steep incline and the other carried on downwards into a thick forest. He frowned slightly, wavering before pointing to the steep path  \n>\"It's that way- I'm sure of it. The warm wind is stronger in this direction and it would make sense if you think about if for the innocence to have picked higher ground- more protection\" Lavi nodded, strapping the ski's to his backpack and checking behind them for the young girl and her father who had been following them since they left off<br>\"Sure thing, Moyashi- though I'm not entirely convinced you're not just choosing it so you don't have to go on the ski's again!\" He teased, prodding the younger boy's cheek pointedly. Allen glowered slightly  \n>\"I'm going to be covered in bruises tomorrow\" He moaned, rubbing his back<br>\"It's not fair- I always go flying because I'm not strapped in and your just fine! In fact, I'm not entirely convinced you're not doing this on purpose\" He accused as the two made their way up the incline- bickering as they went  \n>\"How could you suggest such a thing! I would never be so cruel\" Lavi wailed, clinging to Allen's backpack despondently, forcing the younger boy to drag his entire weight up the path<br>\"I'm heartbroken! I wont let go until you take that back!\" he whined as Allen stubbornly marched his way up the hill, leaving a deep track as Lavi's heels dragged in the snow  \n>\"You would never be so cruel? You're half breaking my back baka usagi!\" He yelled as he struggled onwards, sincerely wishing that it wasn't summer so he could take out his wand and turn Lavi into something unpleasant... After struggling a few meters through the snow and realising that Lavi was deadly serious Allen finally gave up<br>\"Fine- you are a kind, thoughtful and considerate individual who never in their wildest dreams would even contemplate causing a fellow team member any form of physical or mental damage now will you PLEASE let go of me?\" He yelled. Lavi snapped out of his despondent state remarkably quickly and bounded up along side Allen, grinning from ear to ear again  \n>\"Why thank you Allen, that was most kind of you to say\" he chirped, seeming not to notice Allen rolling his eyes in exasperation. A strong gust of warm air blasted down the hill, tugging at their thick clothing in contempt. Allen raised one arm to block it and the two teens fought on through the slowly melting snow<br>\"Well, we are definitely on the right path anyway\" He said rather grimly, ducking out of the way of a sheet of ice that separated itself from one of the straggly trees stubbornly clinging to the mountain side and fell with a muffled thud to the thick snow carpet below  \n>\"It's interesting isn't it- how each piece of innocence defends itself in unique way and attaches itself to different types of hosts\" Allen said rather thoughtfully. Lavi's eyes lightened at the subject that intrigued him so much<br>\"Yeah, its fascinating\" He enthused \"Each piece has its own ability, and affinity- what is really fascinating is the host it choses. The Order have dedicated endless resources to figuring out what it is that makes accommodators 'resonate' with the innocence. I mean, exorcists are so diverse, there is no common denominator yet innocence is so specific- for example, although you are a host, you couldn't use Ōzuchi Kozuchi (1)- my innocence- or Mugen for that matter\" He only just caught himself in time from carrying on this topic- the kid was good! \"That is why your innocence is so intriguing, Allen\" He carried on smoothly, trying to steer the conversation towards information gathering  \n>\"I have only ever seen one other parasitic type and it was acquired at a much more advanced stage than yours. I believe Crowly- the host- received it at the age of 20. He was given it by one of our generals- I don't suppose you recall who gave you yours?\" Allen didn't answer for a while, pretending to be concentrating on his footing on the narrow path as he had an inner debate. He knew Lavi was fishing for information however the only thing he really wished to hide was that he was a wizard- a cursed wizard. He needed Lavi and the other exorcists to trust him and that meant giving as much information as possible but he still begrudged giving in to the unspoken interrogation competition that the two had entered. Still, he saw how irritated Lavi had been when he had gotten so animated on the topic of innocence so at the moment, Allen was sitting at 1 nill. He allowed himself a moment to bask in the glory before giving in and bringing them to an equal score<br>\"As far as I'm aware, I've had mine from birth\" He said, drawing up alongside Lavi so he didn't have to yell above the roaring wind  \n>\"Though that may not be true- I've had it as long as I remember but I was abandoned as a child so its not as if there is anyone I could ask to confirm it\" He shrugged lightly and smiled \"Sorry if I'm not much help- I know very little about my past. What about your innocence?\" He asked, unable to restrain himself from trying to get one up again. Lavi looked up at him and they both smiled the exact same polite smile<br>\"Oh, my story isn't all that exciting really- I came to the black order with my mentor- bookman- to record the battle and then found that I resonated with one of the pieces of innocence that Hevlaska had. The old panda resonated too actually. I don't think I have ever seen Lvierre so excited\"  \n>2-1 Allen thought triumphantly however, Lavi wasn't about to let him off so easily<br>\"Have you ever heard the name Marion Cross? He is the general I was talking about that gave Crowley his innocence fragment and somehow managed to make him a parasitic type\" He fixed his piercing gaze on Allen, his smile still relaxed and friendly but the gleam in his eye betraying him  \n>\"The name doesn't ring a bell- sorry\" Allen said truthfully. To be fair, he had never stayed in the same place for any length of time (apart from Hogwarts) he had always been on the move and had never really stayed long enough anywhere to make proper connections with people so it was very possible that he had met this 'Marion Cross' and just didn't remember. Lavi however wasn't quite ready to drop it yet<br>\"He was really quite distinctive- you would definitely have remembered meeting someone like him. He had waist length red hair and he always wears a half-mask over the right side of his face. He has a habit of building up debts as well. You really couldn't have missed him\"  \n>Allen shook his head and shrugged before it hit him. Trying very hard to disguise the flash of realisation in his eyes (2-2), he started throwing out other bits of information in the hopes of distracting Lavi<br>\"I don't remember really, but I might have- I spent my childhood travelling around in circuses and the like. They tend to be populated by the eccentric types and compulsive gambling is almost a requirement. I've been able to gamble for as long as I can remember so even if I had ever met him, I wouldn't remember\" He continued to babble out meaningless stories from his circus life, well aware that his sudden talkativeness was likely to raise alarms but he was in a bit of a blind spin... his mind was flying off to all sorts of crazy things. The man Lavi had described fitted the description of that weird holligram-y teacher thing he had stumbled across... but there was no way that was a real person. Was there? And if so who was he? Why was he in Hogwarts? And what did he have to do with his innocence?  \n>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>As the day proceeded, the warm wind cooled back to its natural temperature of just below freezing however the damage was already done. The path was insanely slippery as the top layer of snow was a now a mixture of ice, slush and water which seeped its way through every layer of the boys thick clothes, chilling them to the bone, effectively stopping all conversation as the most they could manage was changing the speed of their chattering teeth. It was beginning to get late as well which wasn't helping matters. The sun was low in the sky and was blindingly bright. It was Allen's turn to take the lead and he struggled through the freeing slush, clearing a path for Lavi who was following, his hand on Allen's shoulder and his head bent against the sharp wind. He squinted his eye against the blazing white snow beneath his feet but it had little effect and he was effectively walking blind. The unnaturally warm wind had done more than make the path unpleasant to travel on- it had also made it less stable as much of what held the mountain together was ice and it had a tendency to become rather temperamental when it lost this structural support as Lavi was about to find out. It didn't take much- the path had been considering collapsing for the majority of the day, sending little clumps of earth and snow down periodically to test the ground beneath. After some consideration, it decided to commit to the move- the valley was oh-so-nice this time of year and it really deserved a holiday in the sun. Unfortunately for Lavi, it was at this stage he stepped on to this section of the path. He barely had time to think \"Oh bugger\" before the ground beneath him was... well... no longer beneath him and he found himself in the unpleasant situation of free falling from a not-insubstantial mountain. Allen spun around as he felt the ground shift and he just barely had time to grab hold of Lavi's hand before he disappeared over the edge of the cliff. The combined weight of Lavi and his backpack threw Allen off balance and he too would have been thrown off the cliff if he hadn't activated his innocence and dug his claws firmly into the snowy ground, anchoring the two of them to the cliffside- Lavi swinging off the edge and Allen starfished on the remnants of the path, one arm holding onto Lavi and the other wedged into the thick ice. There was a stunned silence as the two slowly realised that a)They weren't dead and b)They were currently swinging like a novelty pendulum over a seemingly endless drop to the valley far, far beneath their dangling feet. Lavi's heart spasmed as he stared down at the drop beneath him. His brain flew at a dizzying speed as his bookman training went into a frantic panic, unhelpfully calculating the statistical chances of his survival, the approximate drop he would face and the length of time he would have to contemplate his fate as he hurtled inexorably towards the unforgiving ground. It then pointed out to him that the black object swinging lazily along with him was in fact only the link he had to the person who literally had his life in his hands and that- well- it wasn't exactly linking them anymore. True to Komui's design, the collar had quite happily detached itself from the young boys neck, after deciding that plummeting off a thousand odd foot drop counted as 'mortal danger'. After logging this piece of information, Lavi's bookman side cheerfully informed him that his statistical survival rate was plummeting almost as quickly as he soon would be. He frantically began searching for some foot or hand hold in the cliff face before him, sending the two boys swinging like crazy again  \n>'Stop it Lavi!\" Allen yelled as his shoulder screamed in protest<br>\"Listen to me: Everything is going to be OK\" He tightened his grip on Lavi's hand and a really horrible bit of his mind quietly announced '3-2'  \n>\"I've got you. It's going to be alright. Just listen to me ok? Ignore everything else- now stop moving\" His firm, gentle tone calmed Lavi's racing heart somewhat and he stopped squirming. There was nothing to hold onto anyway, the cliff face was smooth after the miniature landslide. There was no point in taking Allen with him too. The old panda was going to be really annoyed at him: dying after all that training to be a bookman. He would be livid!<br>\"Lavi!\" Allen yelled again, snapping him out of his reviver \"You need to unstrap your backpack- you're too heavy for me to pull up with that on\" It took a couple minutes for Lavi to register that Allen was serious and he was actually not going to just let go and then another couple of minutes to pluck up the courage to actually move again. It took another five minutes for his numb, trembling fingers to actually unclip the straps, sending the backpack hurtling downwards to the shadowy valley beneath. Lavi grabbed hold of Allen with both hands with a vice like grip as the momentum sent them swinging again. Allen's shoulder creaked in protest and thin thread-like cracks spread across the ice his claws were sunk into.  \n>\"Lavi- listen to me\" Allen gasped, his voice slightly less calm \" I'm going to lower myself down so I can help you up, then you can pull me up OK? I'm not strong enough to pull you up like this\" He wriggled his way as slowly as he could to the edge of the path and lowered himself down, trying to ignore his brain as it unhelpfully informed him that he was being very, very foolish. Lavi swung up and caught hold of Allen's shoulders and for a few moments as he tried to calm himself down enough to make the next move, the two swung in an awkward embrace. After his heart had settled into what only the most generous person would call a rhythm, he heaved himself up so he had on knee on Allen's shoulder and he was holding onto the arm that was buried deep into the mountain face.<br>\"Hurry up' Allen gasped as the ice grumbled ominously and the cracks deepened. He grabbed a handful of Lavi's jacket and shoved him up onto the ledge. Lavi rolled off on to the path and- still unconvinced that he had actually survived falling off the face of a cliff- he lent over and pulled Allen up. Allen crumpled to the ground, deactivating his innocence and clinging onto his shoulder, moaning in pain. Neither of the two said anything for quite some time and the only sound was their heavy breathing and the odd whimper of relief.  \n>\"Thanks\" Lavi said eventually, still staring in mmild disbelief at the collar which was still hanging from his wrist. Allen shrugged<br>\"You'd have done the same for me\" Lavi was slightly shocked at the certainty with which he spoke- would he have done the same thing? His training said no- after all the risk was high and the chance of a rescue attempt being successful were slim. The logical thing to do in that situation would be to let the other party member die rather than risk a rescue attempt and kill both of them. However... he mentally shook himself. No, he would have left Allen if the situations had been switched. No question about it. He looked down at the empty collar again and tried to figure out the most polite way to go about getting the person who just saved his life to chain himself up again. Allen however seemed to have figured out what was going through Lavi's head and dragged himself across to where Lavi lay and wordlessly picked up the collar and re-attached it. Silence fell for another few minutes  \n>\"Thanks\" Lavi muttered again. The two lay in the snow as the sun sunk further and further down in the sky. Every now and again, one would try to get up but their legs seemed unwilling to obey their commands and each attempt was unsuccessful. Eventually, Elda and her father caught up with the two boys. Elda immediately ran to their side and helped them to their feet and worriedly checking over them for any injuries, thanking the heavens that they were both fine. Her father however seemed almost disappointed that they had survived the experience and glowered at the people he believed were attempting to steal his only means of reviving his dead son for their own benefit.<br>\"Amatures\" He spat angrily \"You shouldn't be up on these mountains- you are a danger to yourselves and others\" He glowered at the two boys, as if hoping they would turn around and leave him to continue his search alone. Lavi noticed anger flash momentarily through Allen's eyes but as soon as he noticed it, it was gone(3-2 and 1/2. Even Lavi had to bitterly reconise that seeing a flash of anger through Allen's mask didn't quite amount to as many points as seeing blind panic through his as he narrowly missed a painful death) Allen smiled politely  \n>\"I'm sorry, we do not know these mountains as well as an experienced mountaineer would however we cannot turn back. We have a mission to complete-much like you do- and we do not abandon things half way through. Now, we should probably try to find some shelter. Its getting late\" Lavi and Allen walked side by side, supporting each other- their legs still unwilling to support their own weight. Barely a word was said all night and Elda filled the silence with nervous chatter. Lavi and Allen were still shell-shocked from their close shave and Elda's father was unwilling to speak at all to the boys. Thankfully it was Elda who was cooking and she had no problem sharing her supplies with the two boys whose own supplies were now a few thousand feet below them. The exhausted travellers settled down for the night however, despite his exhaustion, Lavi just couldn't get to sleep. Each time he reached the gently-drifting-off-to-sleep stage his brain yelled 'AAARRRGHH WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE!' terrifying him back into consciousness to find that a)He wasn't dying and b) He was exhausted. After the third unpleasant awakening Lavi let out a groan of irritation and stood up, his sleep deprived brain cleverly suggesting that a walk would perhaps clear his head. Unfortunately, it had forgotten that he was still attached to Allen and this resulted in the young teen being unpleasantly woken as the leather collar half-strangled him<br>\"Lavi!\" He gasped \"what the heck are you doing\"  \n>\"Ah, sorry\" Lavi apologised, sitting down beside his disgruntled companion. Allen massaged his bruised windpipe and glared half-heartedly at his friend<br>\"Why aren't you asleep? Its...\" he glanced at his wrist watch \"two in the morning\" He groaned \"go to sleep you idiot\" Lavi sheepishly rubbed the back of his head  \n>\"huh, didn't realise it was that late- I was about to go for a walk- just forgot that we were still attatched. Sorry' Allen gave him a rather assessing look<br>\"Can't sleep?\" he said. Lavi shrugged one sholder half-heartetdly  \n>\"I guess my adrenaline levels are still pretty high after that incident\" He laughed. Allen sighed and held out his hand<br>\"Your brain probably still thinks its in free-fall. This'll help. Trust me\" Lavi looked rather dubiously at the outstretched was a bookman for crying out loud! Master of cool, reasoning logic! A trick as simple as that was hardly going to have any effect. Allen glared at him  \n>\"I want to get to sleep without fear of being strangled so take my hand, shut up and go to sleep baka usagi!\" He snapped- it was the most impolite speech he had made to Lavi and the red-head was slightly taken aback- he gave in and did as Allen said. Exhaustion crashed down on him like a tonne of boulders and he just has time to feel slightly irritated that the kid had been right before he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.(4-2 and 12)  \n>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>Nothing was said about the exchange the next day and there seemed to be an unspoken agreement never to mention it again (though Allen decided that he was not above using it for blackmail material should the need ever arise). The steep incline levelled off then dipped slightly, sending the group into a thick green forest. The tree's were huddled together as if they were trying to preserve what little heat there was and finding a path between the thick trunks and twisting roots was not easy. Allen peered ahead and blinked rather disbelievingly but no- he wasn't imagining it- someone was moving up ahead. For a moment he thought it might be Kanda but then a group of three strangers emerged. They called ahead with some story of being lost travellers but as they approached, Allen felt a growing sense of foreboding then all of a sudden his eye activated  \n>\"Akuma!\" He yelled, activating his innocence and glancing back to Lavi who nodded, touching the collar and releasing it from Allen's neck. The three akuma, realising their cover was blown, burst out of their skins and rose up into the air<br>\"Three level two's\" Allen called over to Lavi \"Can't sense any more\" He silently thanked his lucky stars that his eye healed in time for this and threw himself into the battle. The level two's though were perfectly designed for a fight in the snow and a barrage of ice-bullets sent him flying backwards. He crashed to the ground painfully but immediately flipped to his feet and charged again, his innocence becoming the gun-like shape again, allowing him to hit the akuma without getting too close. He managed to land a good few blows before the Akuma he was targeting changed tactics and turned its gun's on Elda and her father. Allen barely had enough time to throw himself in front of the ice bullets before they hit the two  \n>\"What are you doing\" He yelled \"Get out of here!\" another round of ice bullets flew towards him and he flinched as they pounded into his upraised arm.<br>\"We're not letting you out of our site\" Snarled the old man \"You know where the leaves of revival are and you are going to lead us to them\" Allen opened his mouth to make and angry retort but had to change position as the Akuma tried to get past him. He let out a yell of pain as more bullets thudded into his body. There was no way he could evade them without Elda and her father being hit  \n>\"Lavi!\" He yelled \"A little help over here!\" But Lavi too was struggling against his opponents and couldn't get near him. Allen returned fire, changing tactics so his shots hit the bullets before they reached him however, the damage was already done. He was chilled to the bone and each time a bullet managed to sneak through his defences, the blackness encroached on his vision a little further. He yelled for Lavi again, even though he knew there was probably nothing he could do to help. Just before he completely lost consciousness, he caught a glimpse of Kanda joining the battle- his ever present scowl an unusually welcome sight. Allen's numbed brain just had enough time to register relief before it succumbed to the injuries he had accumulated and he passed out<br>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0  \n>Allen's head hurt. A lot. He slowly opened one eye then shut it immediately as the blazing white snow sent a bolt of pain through his throbbing brain. Once the pain had died down, he tried again and opened his eyes to find himself traveling by piggyback with Lavi as a means of transport. He registered with some relief that Elda and her father were still in one piece and with less relief that the leather collar was once again firmly attached around his neck.<br>\"Hey Allen\" Lavi chirped \"You're awake!\" Allen smiled in return and fell rather clumsily off his back onto the ground (4-3 and 1/2). Kanda muttered something under his breath and gave the two a disparaging look but they just ignored him. They reached a small wooden cabin where they had a heated debate about what they were going to do. Lavi wanted to leave Allen with Elda and her father in the cabin while he and Kanda went on to look for the innocence, Kanda didn't want the baka usagi within a fifty foot radius of him and didn't trust Allen alone so he wanted to go take care of the innocence himself. Allen protested that he was perfectly healthy and he should go with Lavi and Kanda. Elda's father refused to listen to reason, still believing that the cause of the storm was the leaves of revival and that the exorcists were just trying to steal it. Elda maintained that where her father went, she went too. After arguing non-stop for a good quarter of an hour, Kanda stormed out of the cottage yelling threats to anyone who dared follow, Lavi followed quickly in his footsteps with Allen in tow and both Elda and her father chased after them. Eventually, they came to the source of the powerful wind. It seemed to be coming from the mouth of a dark cave however the wind was too strong for any of them to get close to it. Lavi activated his wood stamp and momentarily halted the wind, allowing the group enough time to pile inside. The cave eventually opened up into a huge cavern, at the centre of which stood a huge tree, its leaves glowing green in the darkness. Kanda, who was the first to reach the cavern approached the tree but as soon as he laid a hand on it, there was a flash of light and he was catapulted through the air back to where Lavi and Allen were standing. Elda's father however wasn't dissuaded and charged at the tree, a feverish light in his eyes. He however met the same fate as Kanda and smacked agains the stone wall at the back of the cave. Elda ran to his side and Kanda, a distinctly sour look of his face, activated his sword. He did not take kindly to being thrown around. Especially not by a tree! Ignoring the cries of Elda's father, he swung his sword and with one blow, sliced the tree through its trunk, revealing the shard of innocence. He stooped to pick it up and, turned to leave. Elda's father ran up \"Give that to e\" he yelled desperately \"I need to revive my son\"  \n>Kanda glared at him contemptuously \"give it up. This will not bring your son back\" he made to walk on but the old man wouldn't give up that easily. He grabbed hold of Kanda's arm to try and wrestle the innocence from him. Kada snapped and raised his hand to hit him but before his blow landed, Allen caught him by the wrist<br>\"A little compassion if you please\" He said, with a rather forced smile. Kanda scowled and wrenched his hand from Allen \"Don't touch me with that cursed limb Moyashi\" He snarled, turning on his heel and striding to the opposite end of the cavern, glowering at Allen as he tried to talk some sense into the grieving father  \n>\"I'm afraid BaKanda is right\" Allen said sorrowfully \"This tree was not the leaves of revival, it was just a shard of innocence trapped inside a regular tree. The wind was a defence mechanism because so many people tried to pluck the leaves from its branches. Nothing can truly bring the dead back. You need to concentrate now on what you have, instead of what you have lost\" He helped him to his feet and the group slowly made their way out of the cave. They had hardly got more than a few feet from the mouth of the cave when the Akuma attacked again. This time however it seemed as if they would be victorious- It was an Akuma to an exorcist and Elda had the sense to drag her father away from the fight. Allen charged at his Akuma, ducking underneath the slashing claws and sweeping his gun around, sending a barrage of bullets towards its bloated body. The Akuma dodged out of the way but didn't manage to avoid all the bullets. Allen charged again, wondering momentarily what the chances were of him being able to run away if he defeated the Akuma quickly enough. He knew Lavi and Kanda could handle themselves, so if he just finished his part of the fight then... At that moment however, a furious yell came from behind him. He spun around to see that Elda's father had broken free and was now holding Kanda in a wrestling hold yelling nonsensically about the leaves of revival. Allen turned with the half-thought of finishing off his Akuma then helping BaKanda before he was killed however when he turned, he found his Akuma was also screaming. The Akuma Lavi was attacking also started screaming and all of a sudden they were absorbed into the middle Akuma. It turned its attack on Kanda, shooting ice at him and freezing his legs and feet to the ground. Lavi (who was closest) charged at the akuma but he met the same fate. Allen had more advantage than the other two as he was behind the Akuma when it attacked. Taking full advantage of his position, he ran as close as he could before discharging the most powerful attack he could. He switched weapons as he got closer and locked claws with the new akuma, exchanging blows at a dizzying speed. The akuma slashed upwards and Allen was forced to leap backwards out of reach of the claws.<br>\"Allen\" Lavi yelled, straining against the ice that encased his legs \"Shoot at the ice and free us!\"(5-3 and 1/2) Allen obeyed, shooting at Lavi and Kanda freeing them. The Akuma took advantage of his momentary distraction and slashed its razor sharp claws at his exposed back. Allen caught the motion out the corner of his eye and twisted out of the way but he wasn't quite quick enough and the black razors tore a line from his shoulder to waist. Lavi and Kanda converged on the Akuma, their attacks landing at exactly the same time and Allen saw the three soul's chains snap and he smiled slightly as they disappeared off into the sky.  \n>\"Allen!\" Lavi yelled, running across the snow with a worried look on his face (5 and 12-3 and 1/2) 'I wonder what he is so worked up about' Allen thought hazily. They had won hadn't they, why did he look so horrified. He glanced down. Surely snow hadn't always been that red. He distinctly remembered it being white before but he suddenly remembered- he was in Greenland. Things always worked differently in different countries. Maybe they had red snow in Greenland... but no, shouldn't it be green? Why... Lavi reached him and wrapped his arms around his waist, lifting him up.  \n>'Hmm' Allen thought dimly 'that feels weird' Now Lavi's hands were red too... foreign countries confused him...<br>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0  \n>Everything hurt. Turns out that the smartest thing to do after being beaten to a pulp by your enemy is not to chase after it so it can slice you up too. Plus now that freaking collar was around his neck again. Bugger. Lavi sure was determined to bring him back to the order- he had kept the collar on even though Allen had been unconscious for a full day. Turns out severe blood loss will do that to a person. Who would have known? They had returned to the first cottage they had been at. The inn keeper had been very hospitatble after seeing the state of Allen and though she subitted Lavi to an hour long lecture about his failure as a bodyguard, she allowed them discounted board even though Allen had literally eaten her out of house and home. She had needed to send off for emergency supplies. Three times. Allen slipped in and out of a comfortable doze, sleeping off the huge meals he had eaten. He woke up periodically and peeked between his lashed at Lavi who was fighting off sleep next to him until eventually he succomed to his heavy eyelids. Allen waited until he was completely certain that he was unconscious before gingerly sitting up and placing both hands on the collar. He was pretty sure he knew what to do now- it became relatively simple after he found out that there was an automated way to separate the leather band. Although this was a great safety measure it gave him an opening. All he had to do was send a small spark of magic through the collar and trip the mechanism. It should only take the smallest amount of magic so he was praying the ministry wouldn't notice. It used no more magic than creating multicoloured sparks from your wand when you got overexcited and they tended not to chase up small cases like that so he should be fine... He touched the tip of his wand to the collar and breathed a sigh of relief as the ring split, freeing him. He quietly slid out of the bed and, holding his arm across his chest to avoid straining his cracked ribs he crept to the door. Before he left though a very, very mean thought came into his head. What was the harm in leaving a little parting gift for them to remember him by? After all, both of them had been pretty mean to him. A few minutes later, Allen exited the cottage chuckling under his breath and making his way slowly down the hill to the train station where he boarded the train via the doors instead of roof<br>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0  \n>Lavi woke up to Kanda strangling him<br>\"whafhthehfe dja thkn ytr diong\" He spluttered  \n>\"You utter imbocile\" Kanda snarled, dragging Lavi up by the scruff of his neck and shaking him like a cat worrying a mouse in the direction of his empty bed<br>\"You let the little brat get away and look what he has done!\" Lavi's sleep befuddled brain took a few seconds longer than it should have to realise why Kanda was pointing furiously at his neck.  \n>The collar.<br>Oh  \n>Oh dear<br>This was going to end very badly indeed  \n>He glanced up and saw a piece of paper pinned to the wall<br>'Final score : 5 and 1/2 to 4 and 1/2. I win :P  \n>PS. Have fun with that Baka Usagi and BaKanda!<br>Pay back is a £ $% ^^'  \n>-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>Allen arrived at Hogwarts late and very disgruntled. He hadn't been able to take a broom with him and the Hogwarts Express was of course no longer running- the term had started literally on the day he finally escaped from that stupid hyperactive bunny and the samurai with anger issues. He had contemplated sending Timcampy on ahead to get Dumbledore to send some form of transport but he felt that would be kind of mean and besides, Tim was unwilling to leave his master alone considering his injuries. All in all, it took him five days to finally get to Hogwarts and he found out that in his absence all hell had broken loose. Voldemorts followers had made a brazen appearance at an international quidditch game, Harry of course had somehow managed to get in the middle of it all though had been once again, saved by a house elf and Hogwarts was now hosting the next biggest event: The Triwizard Tournament. Genius plan. Though to be fair, the death eaters would need to be pretty stupid to attack Hogwarts however, considering all the stuff that had happened in the school over the past few years, Allen began to doubt that its title as the 'safest place in the world' was really justified. He reported back to Dubledore about everything that had happened on his mission  \n>\"It was really weird though, Lavi mentioned something about one of the orders generals. It might be nothing, but the person he described sounded an awful lot like this holligram-y trainer person I've been training with in the room of requirement. Plus Lavi was saying that he had a tendency to build up really terrible debts and almost every new town I went to when I was travelling had some debt collector or other after my blood. They all yelled something about some red-headed man building up debts and telling them that I would pay for them\" He shuddered and purple flames began to emanate from his body<br>\"All those debts...\"  \n>He didn't speak for some time but after the trauma in his eyes faded slightly, he continued.<br>\"I didn't really know what to make of it at the time but it would appear then that this man has been following my progress all this time. The order don't know about me though so it obviously wasn't on their orders\"  \n>Dumbledore steepled his fingers and frowned slightly.<br>\"So one of the generals from the Order knows about you and has been keeping an eye on you this whole time? I wonder why he never turned you over to them\" He trailed off, his blue eyes blazing into Allen. There was a long silence.  \n>\"So where did this hologram come from in the room of requirement\" He asked eventually. Allen shrugged<br>\"It always came on by itself. I never really noticed where it was coming from\"  \n>Dumbledore fell silent for a few minutes, then walked over to Allen and lifted Timcampy off his head. Allen watched him in confusion<br>\"So\" Dumbledore addressed Tim \"Are you going to show yourself... Marion Cross?\"\n\nDun\n\nDun\n\nDuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!\n\n:3\n\n**(1) The actual name of Lavi's innocence :D**\n\n**Also I just couldn't resist the urge to cliffhanger this :D I don't normally but people wanted updates and it'll take a while to write the whole Cross/Dumbledore interaction so yeah XD**\n\n\n\t39. Chapter 39\n\n**OK, So now Cross is part of the story, Kay? And him and Dubley-dore are best buds XD Just roll with it...**\n\n**Poisonous Demon: Now THAT would have been a hilarious twist! Mind you a Cross/Timpampy is kind of terifying to think about... perhaps not**\n\n**MidoriHakari00: Err, sorry to disapoint but no, Allen is not going to be part of the Triwizard Tournament, however he may appear at some stage... hintey hint! Haha, I could totally throw in a dragon befriending scene though if you want :D**\n\n**libro5678: Thank you so much! I will definitely finish this story however, the speed with which I shall finish it is yet to be seen. You may have noticed the severe increase in time lapse between my story chapters :P It will be finished though so do not fear! I have recieved too many death threats to stop now :S (seriously, I have even be threatened by slender man yes, I'm looking at you TheReadingDevil!)**\n\n**NirvanaFrk97: Well, like I have said before, pairings are NOT the concentration of this story- besides which, I think all the characters are so screwed up by he battle that any normal relationship is just going to be impossible for them so I may hint at pairings or throw a little fluff at people here and there but I don't think I will have any definite pairings. Though definitely won't be pairing lena/allen unfortunately, I'm going to have their relationship be much more sibling-y**\n\n**Cana999: Yeah, see above! I wish I could put ALL THE PAIRINGS in tbh, I love Yullen as a pairing, my fangirl engines kinda go into overdrive :3 Don't worry, Allen would never leave Mai so if he goes to the order, she will too!**\n\n**ennuel: Will everyone please stop threatning me :'( I'm gonna start getting paranoid! Still, at least you didn't threaten me with slender man or a flamethrower (Still looking at you TheReadingDevil**\n\n**coronadomontes:Well, if you think about it, he ****_did_**** promise to look after Allen and he knows about the 14th so there is no way he would just let him go without any observation. **\n\nThere was a long awkward silence as Dumbledore and Allen both watched Timcampy; Dumbledore calmly surveying the squirming creature over his steepled fingers and Allen sneaking suspicious glances at the old man out the corner of his eyes wondering vaguely if this was some sort of test or if the old codger had been at the fire whiskey…\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the tense silence, Dumbledore drew his wand\n\n\"You have two choices\" he said mildly \"Either you come out or...\"\n\nHe didn't get the chance to finish his sentence because at that, a tall man dressed in an ankle length black coat appeared. Allen's eyes widened slightly- so the figure he believed to be a hologram produced by the room of requirement was in fact a real person- a general of the order none the less- and yet, the order was still unaware of his existence. This was going to be interesting\n\n\"Tch\" Cross spat \"I do not take kindly to threats, old man\"\n\nDumbledore shrugged lightly \"To be perfectly frank, I couldn't care less. Now, if it isn't too much bother, I would greatly appreciate it if you would inform Allen and I about your role in this battle that we are fighting and whether or not we should fear you\"\n\nCross quirked an eyebrow at this and Dumbledore inclined his head almost apologetically\n\n\"Let me rephrase that; should we fear you more than our enemies… and the order\" he added as an afterthought. The Cross hologram smirked slightly at this\n\n\"The order and I are not exactly bosom buddies- They are far too self righteous and short sighted. Not willing to take the right risks and too eager to take the wrong ones. Unfortunately, the choice in this battle at the moment is them or the Noah and the Order is a means to an end- however unsavoury they may be. Despite this however, I am working on my own project here and Allen is part of that so no, I am no threat to you or him. As of now, keeping our two worlds separate is the best course of action. Unnecessary complications are the last thing that we need\"\n\nAllen breathed a sigh of relief- so he wasn't being secretly watched by the order and even though this guy was a general, he didn't want to turn him in. Not yet at least, though Allen couldn't help but notice how vague Cross was being- he was part of a plan? Why was he so important? And why was it so important that he was kept away from the order? Allen was glad though that this man who knew so much about him wasn't utterly loyal to the order. He appeared to be powerful. Plus he was a General so he was high up in the chain of things, despite his hangups with the way the Order ran things. Allen wondered if he was the reason he had gone unnoticed by the order for so long- when he thought over everything he had managed to extract from Lavi it sort of made sense. Every town Allen had gone to, he had been hunted down by some loan shark or other forced to work hard to repay debts he had never build up. He twitched slightly as he remembered all the jobs and long hours and hard labour he had endured. Still, he wasn't completely stupid- the jobs he had got had provided him with security in strange towns. So this man had been following him for years protecting him in his own strange way from both the Order and the humans. He did not strike Allen as a guy who would go out of his way to help anyone unless he could absolutely help it so there was something else going on. He glanced over to Dumbledore, silver and blue eyes silently communicating across the room. Dumbledore inclined his head ever so slightly\n\n\"Would you mind telling us, Cross Marion why you are communicating through Allen's golem?\" Dumbledore asked, his voice light and friendly. Allen did a slight double take. That was not the question he had expected Dumbledore to ask and besides that, he hadn't noticed up until that point that the hologram was issuing from Tim's mouth\n\n\"Tim!\" He cried in surprise. The golem was practically sweat dropping but it didn't move\n\n\"Ah well\" Cross began rather awkwardly \"That would be because Tim is my golem. I sent him to look after Allen. I knew his adoptive father and I promised to look after Allen if anything should happen to him however I wasn't able to completely fulfil my promise. I did my best to protect him though- sent Tim after him when I found that he was missing. Took us a while to track you down\" He said cooly looking over to Allen who was staring in complete shock at the man who moments ago had been a complete stranger\n\n\"By the time Tim found you, you were managing well enough on your own and I had a number of rather delicate schemes running that I really couldn't abandon to baby sit some kid so I left Tim with you and made sure you were ok but I didn't see any real need to interfere any further though after seeing how behind you are in your fighting I am beginning to think I might have made a mistake\" he muttered rather bitterly. Allen scowled irritated at how lightly the man was talking about him- as if his life was an inconvenience- something that could be dabbled in whenever he felt like it but he bit his tongue. He needed to know more. Losing his temper would get him nowhere and change nothing.\n\nDumbledore studied Cross Marion curiously for a moment\n\n\"Allen, would you mind leaving us for a moment. I need to talk to General Cross alone. You really should go see your friends. They have been worried about you and I'm sure you all have a lot of catching up to do. Don't worry, I'll fill you in on any details later\" He smiled lightly. Allen didn't move for a while, he curled one hand into a fist and clenched his teeth but Dumbledore stared him down. He turned sharply on his heel and strode out of the room, his entire body trembling with anger. He had always been aware that Dumbledore was working on a greater plan behind the scenes but he had almost fooled himself into believing that the head teacher trusted him. He spent his days working on schoolwork, his breaks training and his nights tackling evil killer machines and yet he was still not to be trusted with information about his own future. He barely restrained himself from slamming the door as he walked out of the tower and wondered if he could convince Tim to tell him what went on in the tower when he came back\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Fawkes stretched his wings out, shaking his feathers in the weak sunlight that strained through the dirty windows. His master had been talking with this strange sent less man the whole night long and neither seemed likely to finish any time soon. The two men had been unwillingly sharing information about their respective battles. Neither wanting to say anything but each needing information from the other. Conversation therefore had proceeded slowly but little by little, they each filled the other in on the complexities and rules that each of their worlds abided by.<p>\n\n\"So we may conclude that magic is more or less ineffective against akuma- therefore the risk of introducing both our sides to each other is really not worth it\" Dumbledore summed up, popping a strawberry bon bon into his mouth\n\n\"But now onto more personal matters- what is your interest in Allen. There is more to this than a promise you made to a friend. Tell me, why is he so important\"\n\nCross heaved a sigh and ran his fingers through his hair\n\n\"It's more than a little complicated. I actually don't really know what to think any more. I thought I knew what he was and what to do but things have turned out differently than I imagined. Let me tell you the tale of Allen, Mana and Neah\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen sat with his sleeping daughter until she awoke. It was far too early to go and see his friends, all of which would be sleeping still and besides he wasn't sure he wanted to talk to them in his current state of mind. He knew that if he talked to them, he would need to go back over everything that had happened that night and he was not in the mood for it. Instead, he watched his daughter sleep, the slow rising and falling of her chest and once she woke, he played tea-parties with her until it was time for her to be taken to her new school. Dobby- who had been charged with cleaning that floor- ran to fetch him a strong coffee and a platter stacked high with sugary buns to see him through the day. He felt a little guilty as he made his way to potions but time had sort of ran away with him. His friends would be annoyed with him for not seeing them first but at least this way, they wouldn't be able to cross examine properly until lunch. He swayed slightly as he made his way down to the dungeons: He hadn't slept in… what would it be now… his exhausted brain struggled with the simple calculation for much longer than it should have. He had flown straight from the cabin they had stopped at in Greenland so it was something like 72 hours since he had last slept properly. At that realisation, he promptly walked into a wall. His sleep deprived brain as it turned out was incapable of dealing both with mental maths and coordination. He rebounded slightly and blinked confusedly at the solid brick wall before realising what happened and after checking to see if anyone saw, he turned down the corridor, got half way down, realised he was going the wrong way and doubled back on himself. He arrived at the dungeons just as the last student disappeared through the door. He half flung himself across the corridor and caught the door just before it slammed shut. He breathed a sigh of relief and slipped in. He was halfway to his desk when a cold voice echoed out across the dungeon<p>\n\n\"Ah, Mr Walker. I was wondering when you would grace us with your presence. Apparently its not enough for you to turn up days later than every other student in the school, but you also feel the need to turn up late to class as well. Pray tell me, what exactly is it about you that makes you exempt from all the rules that bind your classmates? Do you think that you are untouchable because the headmaster adopted you? Do you think yourself more important than the rest of us commoners?\" Allen shook his head silently trying to look as apologetic and not-big-headed as possible. It wasn't especially effective. Harry, Ron and Hermione waved energetically behind Snape's back as he ranted and their excited faces made him feel somewhat better. At least someone was pleased to see him. Once Snape eventually ran out of insults, he sent Allen over to his desk and with a flick of his wand, made the instructions for the potion they were brewing that day to appear on the board. The four teens ground their star aniseed in utter silence till Snape was distracted by Dean who made some mistake or other in his potion\n\n\"So, how did things go?\" Harry breathed, eyes bright with anticipation. Hermione glanced nervously over her shoulder and busied herself about her potion- her thick curls falling down and obscuring her face but Allen could tell she was listening just as intently as Ron who was grinding his spices into a fine dust. He filled his friends in on his summer, the whole situation all of a sudden seeming a lot more comical and a lot less stressful as he said it out loud. Ron sniggered at him\n\n\"You allowed yourself to be chained up by someone as stupid as this Lavi guy!\" He scoffed. Allen glowered at him\n\n\"I didn't really have a choice and Lavi is many things but stupid is not one of them\"\n\nHermione lifted her head slightly and gave him a rather strange look before returning to her potion and blanking him completely. Through the rest of the day, they filled him in on the occurrences at Hogwarts- all about the Quidditch match, Triwizard Tournament and the many schools that would soon be descending on their beloved castle. Allen couldn't help but wonder why this was happening now; it made little sense that the ministry would re-instate such a dangerous competition after so long, especially since it was being held at the school of their precious 'chosen one' though to be fair, Harry wasn't old enough to participate and after the fiasco with Sirius Black, the ministry probably felt it had something to prove to the wizarding community though when you considered the spectacular failure of the quidditch tournament, you had to wonder why they didn't just accept defeat and admit to everyone that their leadership and organisational skills were more or less non existent. Though- to be fair- that probably wouldn't be very good for their public image… Still, if this huge big event went off without a hitch, he would eat Timcampy! Eventually the end of the day came and Allen only just had enough energy left to drag his weary body up to the Gryffindor common room, which was even more homey and comfortably warm than Allen remembered it being. He collapsed into one of the armchairs which practically hugged him in its cushiony comfort. He let out a groan of relief and burrowed down even further into its embrace letting the chatter of his friends wash over him. He shut his eyes for a moment and didn't open them again until Hermione gently shook him awake the next morning\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Though the day, Cross and Dumbledore had been filling each other in on the nuances of their respective battles. It was slow going because neither wanted to give too much away without equal knowledge from the other but eventually they were both caught up. After ranting at each other about the incompitancies of those in charge, they went on to discuss their plans and strategies with each other. Though neither would have admitted it, they found this meeting incredibly beneficial- it got awfully lonely, being the only genius in a group of idiots and every genius loves his work being appreciated but when your audience has its head too far up its own backside to even begin to comprehend the brilliance of your intelligence it really wasn't worth the effort.<p>\n\n\"Now, as for this whole Allen-Order fiasco, I think I may have an idea. It won't be as neat a fix as I would perhaps like, but under the circumstances, it is the best we can do. You'll need to do something for me to help it work though\"\n\nDumbledore smirked ever so slightly\n\n\"Was that you requesting my help?\" He asked- an undertone of humour in his voice. Cross glared at him\n\n\"Only to clear up the mess you created! Now listen up...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>In the order, Komui sleepily watched as his subordinates dug through the swathes of papers that were drowning his desk. A short and rather abrupt message had arrived via golem from a general who had heard from a friend who had heard from a drunken acquaintance who had overheard from his... female companion that Cross Marion had sent a very important document to the black order<p>\n\n\"FOUND IT!\" Reever yelled in triumph from underneath one of the mini mountains. All that was visible was the fist clutching a rumpled envelope. Komui snatched it from his had and left him to find his own way out of the death trap he had got himself into\n\n\"Greetings and all that\n\nI have recently taken on an apprentice called Allen\n\nHe may turn up every now and again to give a hand\n\nThat is all\n\nCross\"\n\nKomui blinked a few times.\n\n\"Right then, we probably should remove the 'dead or alive' clause we currently have on the boy\" He said mildly\n\nLavi who was present- as he always was when something interesting was going down- left as silently as he had arrived\n\nSo the young boy was Cross's apprentice. Or was he? He certainly hadn't mentioned it and when Lavi had asked him about Cross, although there had been a flicker of recognition in his eyes, it wasn't until he had mentioned the appearance of the General and even then, it had been faint. Surely not the reaction that you would expect from an apprentice. It was possible that Allen had just been more adept at the poker face than Lavi had initially thought but why would he even have wanted to hide his apprenticeship with Cross? It would have made life much easier for him if he had just mentioned it and the Order wouldn't have been trying to hunt him down. Though Cross had always been a law into himself and tended to dislike the Order knowing his business. It was possible then he reasoned but improbably. And if it was untrue, why was the General covering for the young boy? Regardless of whether the boy was actually Cross's apprentice sent to help the order, the one solid conclusion that could be drawn from this situation was that the boy was special in some way- he must be for a lazy layabout like Cross to take so much notice of him.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen clenched his fists in an attempt to control his shaking- not quite sure himself if it was fear or anger that was making the tremors run through his entire body. He watched as his professor forced his students one after another perform tasks that they did not wish to do. One wave of his wand and their faces went blank. All their inhibitions disappeared. They had no control over their movement, their actions, their words. They became puppets; marionettes and they couldn't stop themselves. Allen shivered. How could his classmates look so calm. Why weren't they even slightly concerned. Each seemed to approach this like it was just a game- a competition- 'see if I can be made to something more stupid than my friend'. Allen tightened his grip on his wand unconsciously as Mad Eye Moody turned to him. The teacher's playful smile flickered slightly and then came back, more feral than before<p>\n\n\"Ah, finally someone with fight in their eyes. Let's see what you can do Mr. Walker\" He drawled almost playfully before flicking his wand at lightning speed\n\n\"IMPERIO\"\n\nThere was a loud crack. Allen felt something of enormous power surge inside his chest and as it grew, his sight blackened momentarily and then it was gone as soon as it had come. Moody was sprawled over a tangle of chairs and desks at the opposite side of the room and the entire classroom was staring at him. Allen glanced down at his wand- unsure as to what had just happened. His wand however was still hanging by his side. He looked back up at Mad Eye who had disentangled himself and was limping (more heavily than before) towards Allen, his expression unreadable. Allen instinctively raised his wand to chest hight and backed up slightly but Mad Eye just gave him a slightly upraising look before announcing to the class\n\n\"See, there is proof that with a strong enough will you can overcome even the most powerful spells. I wouldn't advise anyone to try to control this boy anytime soon. Not if they value their life\" He laughed at his little joke- his laugh sounding more ominous than anything else that had come out of his mouth all day- and that was saying something\n\n\"Ronald Weasly- you are next\"\n\n…\n\n\"How either of you fought it is beyond me\" Ron grumbled as he skipped down the corridor (he had not done well against the imperio curse at all- in fact, he seemed to have somehow worsened the effect of it so that even after Moody removed it, he still skipped everywhere he went. Hermione found this more than a little amusing)\n\n\"I barely fought it\" Harry muttered \"Face planted into a desk remember? Allen however managed to throw MAD EYE MOODY half way across the freaking classroom. Watch your back man, that teacher is phsyco! A genius but psycho!\" Allen groaned and hung his head\n\n\"I know- I didn't mean to do it! It just sort of… happened\"\n\n\"Wish it had happened to me\" Ron whined \"My legs are getting tired\" Hermione snorted with laughter and continued to rib Ron as they walked back to the common room. Allen tuned their conversation out, still shaken up by that spell and what he accidentally did to his teacher. Had he known that this was one of the last amicable moments he was going to have with his friends for a while and the answer to why he had managed to defeater Moody's spell he perhaps would have spent less time dwelling on his lesson and more time simple enjoying the company of those dear to him while he could. But he did not know and therefore dwell he did\n\n* * *\n\n><p>There was a loud crash as the owlry door was slammed. Allen's jerked in shock and almost fell off the balcony he was sitting on. The book he had been reading fell from his hand and he just had time to catch it with an elevating charm before it disappeared. He spun around, his mouth open in shock but before he could yell Harry stormed over completely ignoring the fact that he had very nearly killed his friend. And his book. Lets not forget the book<p>\n\n\"Ron is a complete imbecile\" He exploded \"I had nothing to do with putting my name in that goblet! Nothing! He is acting so childishly\" He sat down opposite Allen with an irritated huff. There was a short pause then \"Oh come on!\" Harry shouted \"Your supposed to say something- explain it or fix it or something\" Allen put his head on one side\n\n\"Oh for goodness sake just say something! I'm being stuck in a mental competition that I am not ready for, fighting against students more skilled than I am and my best friend isn't talking to me! Please, explain this to me\" His green eyes fixed on Allen's, pleading and desperate. Allen opened his mouth to reply\n\n\"I mean I know that he is probably sick of all the attention I get but so am I! I didn't ask for this\" Harry continued\n\n\"ah\" Allen began\n\n\"Does he think I enjoy having people hero worship me for something I had no actual control over? I mean my parents were murdered by a sadistic psychopath and I survived on a fluke but for some reason this makes me worthy of praise? It's ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as this competition I mean who makes a game for school kids like this! And why is it a binding contract? I mean what if I got Ill? Or mortally wounded? Urgh the wizarding community is SO backwards sometimes\" he ran his fingers through his already messy hair increasing the puff to a ridiculous level\n\n\"Do you…\"Allen interjected in the short silence\n\n\"I just don't get why he won't just help me… I know he always feels like a sidekick or something but I don't think of him that way at all, that is a role he has put on himself- he is my best mate. I need him! I need him to calm me down and help me relax and take my mind of the fact that it is very probable that I will come out of this with fewer limbs than when I entered. He doesn't have to be happy for me- he just needs to support me\" Harry exploded\n\n\"Have you…\" Allen began\n\n\"This is ridiculous\" Harry muttered \"I don't need him. He can go do what ever he feels like. Maybe he can go find some other psyco wizard and ask politely if they wouldn't mind cursing a scar onto his face to last as an everlasting reminder of what happened to him then he can see it every time he looks in the mirror- be unable to hide who his is and what has happened to him- have everyone who meets him automatically know the most private and painful moment of his life and make a public spectacle of it- then maybe he will be happy\" He spat the words out as if they were bitter pills. Allen gave up trying to talk and just let his friend rant on, striding up and down the balcony, robes billowing out behind him in the wind. When he eventually shut up, Allen sat down beside him and put a comforting arm around his shoulder. After an appropriate amount of silence he said\n\n\"You'll get through this- you are tougher than you think. Also you don't really have a choice\" He then got up and left, clutching his precious book possessively to his chest and leaving a rather dumbstruck Harry behind him\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Lena-lee and Lavi sat beside each other in absolute silence broken only by the train station tannoy. Five minutes then ten passed. Lavi flicked open the pocket watch he had an a chain around his neck<p>\n\n\"He'll come\" Lena-lee said with absolute certainty, ignoring Lavi and scanning the milling crowns of people for the white-haired boy. Lavi didn't reply. The meeting had been set up by the order- Cross had left the communication number for Timcampy scrawled on the back of his letter and through this, Komui had set up the meeting with Allen on command from the higher up's. Said elevated people were currently staking out the area. Some hiding around the perimeter and some surreptitiously walking up and down the platform trying (and failing) to look as nonchalant as possible. Lavi and Lena-lee were the only official pair of exorcists at the meeting. Something about setting Allen at ease by having him meet people he had previously had contact with. They briefly considered sending Kanda too however even the order quickly realised that that was most definitely not a good idea. It didn't help either that the finder who suggested the idea to Kanda was currently cowering in a dark corner somewhere in the Order muttering about the 'demon possessed samurai'\n\n\"Aha… sorry I kept you waiting~\" A slightly stressed out voice sang from behind them. Lavi and Lenalee turned to see Allen standing on the platform behind them, a small Chinese girl by his side\n\n\"Mai needed the toilet and I got lost. Twice. I'm here now though! Shall we?\" He swept his hand towards the exit, flashing them a quick smile.\n\nHe knows Lavi thought suddenly, not sure exactly what it was in the smile or the gesture that told him this, all he knew was that Allen was completely aware that he had about fifty eyes all trained on him at that moment in time and that the Order was more than willing to take him down if he should so much as sneeze unexpectedly. He wondered briefly if that was why he brought his daughter with him- to build up trust with the Order. Bringing her was a validation of his previous story to Lenalee- that he had a daughter and had avoided joining the order so that he could look after her. Perhaps he was also naive enough to think that the sight of a little girl would make the exorcists less willing to attack. Whatever his reasons, it certainly seemed to have been a good move. Lenalee already had the little child cradled in her arms and was chattering animatedly to her, smiles wreathing their faces. Even Lavi was feeling a slight tug at his heartstrings at the innocence and unadultered joy the little girl brought with her. He noticed that Allen was much more relaxed now his child was with him. His smiles seemed more genuine and his posture less military. He led the other two to a small diner (Lavi smirked internally at this- it was a smart move. The building was too small for more than a few members of the order to enter unnoticed and it was in front of a relatively busy shopping street so any people lurking about would be easy to spot. Lavi flicked his eyes over to Allen's and glanced away almost immediately, a small smirk playing in his lips.\n\n\"So…\" Allen started nervously as the waitress stumbled off, looking slightly shell shocked by the order she had just received\n\n\"What do you want to know?\"\n\nThe order had provided the two young exorcists with a list as long as their arm full of questions they wanted answered. Lavi and Lenalee however came to the unanimous decision that they were not going to go through them all. They had to ask the most important ones however or they would never hear the end of it\n\n\"Well, for starters\" Lenalee began \"Where is General Cross?\"\n\nAllen grimaced slightly\n\n\"You are probably not going to believe me… but I don't know. My master has been missing for some time. Master didn't want the Order to know where he was so he left me here about a year ago and figured that if they knew I was in the country and that I was his apprentice, they wouldn't notice that he was AWOL. Not that his plan worked awfully well since Komui didn't bother to open the letter anyways\" He laughed at that \"I love it when my masters scheming falls apart: Serves him right.\" He lightly placed his hands over Mai's ears before continuing \"The prick\"\n\nLenalee looked rather shocked at his venomous tone\n\n\"Trust me\" Allen said grimly \" That is the most polite description he has received of himself for a long time\"\n\n\"Do you really expect us to believe that he just left the only apprentice he has ever taken on and hasn't bothered to check up on you or anything? You must have at least some idea of where he is\"\n\nAllen look slightly amused at this \"I think you have the wrong impression of my master. He didn't take me on because he cares for me or anything, he took me on because he was curious about me and he wanted to screw with the order so after he had learnt as much as he wanted to know about my innocence, my only purpose was to act as his own little power play over them. That's why he had me help you guys out but not join you. He's childish like that\"\n\nThe questioning went on for some time but Allen had a watertight story and even Lavi struggled to poke holes in it. That wasn't to say that he believed a single word that came out of the boys mouth, he just moved him up slightly in his estimation: The kid was possibly the best lier he had ever met. Eventually though they had to admit defeat, after which there was a mad skirmish as all the onlooking finders and exorcists tried to jump the kid and force him to come back to the order with them. It was a fiasco (to put it lightly). Allen and Mai seemed to disappear instantaneously as they converged on him and all they succeeded in doing was giving each other some bruises and black eyes to remember the day by.\n\nAllen continued to show up wherever he was needed though over the next few months. How he knew where and when he was needed none had really figured out yet but he did. There was even a rumour wondering about (very softly whispered) that he had helped Kanda out on one mission. Not that the formidable exorcist had been in over his head- for everyone knew that was just impossible- however, he had returned from a mission in worse shape than he had been seen before and he muttered something about \"That damn moyashi\" before disappearing into his room. They of course still tried to bring him back to the order each time he turned up but soon their efforts became less energetic and soon they were barely trying at all. They even began to spend time with him out-with the missions. Lenalee in particular seemed to really get on with both him and Mai who she seemed to have half-adopted. Lavi too spent some time with Allen however when they were alone together things generally degraded into some twisted mind game or battle of wits which wasn't really what most people would consider 'quality time together' but each to their own…\n\nAllen greatly appreciated this development, there was a lot less sneaking around and stressing out that he would be caught. He was still fighting akuma in the way he had wished and as he spent more and more time with the exorcists, he began to realise he wasn't as alone as he had previously thought. Each of them had gone through similar things to him and they understood more about his life than his friends at Hogwarts- not that they had not gone through their own share of perils. It was just a slightly different situation. Besides, with they way things were at the moment, his friends weren't really in the most talkative mood. He ended up spending most of his free time either trawling through the library for some spell that could conceivably take on a dragon or helping Harry practice his spells so going on a mission was a bit of a welcome break\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The air in the club was thick and smoky- music throbbing so loudly that the entire dance floor was shaking to its rhythm. Lavi sighed internally as he contemplated the writhing mass of bodies with some disgust. Typical that he would get stuck with this mission of all missions. Disappearances at a club had piqued the orders interest and as Lavi was still recovering from a few difficult missions, they decided to send him on this easy one as something of a break It was as close as the order came to giving holidays. He knew as well that they were planning on sending him and Lenalee on the search for General Cross which would most definitely not be an easy mission. Kanda was also set to depart on a search for General Tiedol. He had not really appreciated this order and even Lavi had been avoiding him recently after he pushed him a bit too hard one day and lost half his fringe to mugen. He supposed he really should appreciate the easy missions while they lasted but to be honest, it was far more likely that the disappearances were just down to humans being humans. Lavi took a deep breath of the fresh air and steeled himself for entering the suffocating atmosphere. Just as he was about to enter, he heard a voice nearby call<p>\n\n\"Hey Lavi! Wait up!\" A hand caught his elbow and he turned to find Allen standing beside him, breathing heavily- he obviously had ran a fair bit to catch up with him\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Lavi asked bluntly, cooly observing Allen's attempt at dressing like a cluber. It was pitiful to say the least- he was wearing a white shirt and a pair of dark jeans with trainers\n\n\"Oh, I just thought you might need a hand thats all\" He laughed\n\n\"What on earth do you think your wearing by the way? You look like your going to a fancy diner, not a night club\"\n\nAllen frowned, looking rather confused\n\n\"But I'm dressed really casually! I thought I had overdone it. I'm not wearing a tie, I don't have my top button done, I'm even wearing jeans and trainers!\" He looked uncomprehendingly up at Lavi who couldn't help but laugh at the teen's 18th century mind\n\n\"Suits are never club outfits, no matter how casual. Never mind, there's enough people here that I don't think they will notice too much. At least it'll make it easier for me to find you when you get lost (He very deliberately emphasised his use of the word when instead of if- He had yet to go on a mission with the bean sprout where he didn't manage to get lost)\n\nAllen stuck his tongue out childishly at Lavi and grabbed his wrist, dragging him into the club without any warning. Lavi let out a yelp of surprise before he could help it and Allen's triumphant laughter was audible even over the booming bass of the nightclub.\n\nLights flickered and spun, disorientating the boys- the dancers appeared to be moving frame-by-frame and the bright lights half-blinded them. Lavi smirked and lent close to Allen so he could yell into his ear- the only way you could conceivably be heard over the noise-\n\n\"I guess this explains why people come to pubs when they want to get layed- its so blinding you can't tell what your going home with and its so loud they could be the dumbest person out there and none could tell\" He felt slightly triumphant at the blush that spread all over Allen's face and the boy wrinkled his nose\n\n\"Don't be so crude Lavi!\" He whined. \"Look, we need to try and work the dance floor- I'll be able to detect any Akuma but there is just so many people it might be a bit difficult to cover the whole room\" Lavi winked. Or blinked. It was rather hard to tell\n\n\" Let me teach ya a little something about clubs boy-o you don't work the dance floor, the dance floor works you. You gotta go with the flow! Now excuse me, I see a couple of cute drunk girls. May as well make the most of this waste of a mission ciao!\" With this, he disappeared off in the vague direction of a group of girls, jerking his body to the rhythm and somehow managing to slip through the people booking his way. Allen stood frozen to the spot for a few minutes\n\n'Boy-o\" He whispered to himself incredulously before shaking his head and trying to figure out how Lavi had managed to penetrate the solid wall of dancers.\n\nLavi made his way towards the busy bar, a self satisfied grin plastered across his face, he was getting on very, very well with the group of uni students who thought his eye patch was 'sexy' He grabbed a few bottles of Wick'd **(A/N I believe this is an alcoholic beverage which uni students consume in clubs. It is very probable that I am wrong. I don't know that I really care)** before starting on his way back but before he could return, Allen caught him by the arm once again. The kid looked significantly more rumpled than he had before though this did make him look a bit more club-appropriate. His shirt had even been torn at the shoulder Lavi raised an eyebrow at this but Allen just shook his head, his expression slightly haunted\n\n\"Clubers are vicious people\" He shuddered but then his expression became more serious \"I found the Akuma, Lavi, its a level two. Still in human form though, I think its picking its prey and it'll lure them out and kill them elsewhere. This is too public\" Lavi looked forlornly over to where the girls were waiting for him\n\n\"Don't suppose there's any chance you can just handle this yourself?\" He asked hopefully. Allen scowled disapprovingly\n\n\"Go make your excuses. I'll start this\" He dug through his pocket and pulled out a cross rose badge which he pined to the front of his shirt \"This should act as bait\" Lavi looked at the badge wide-eyed\n\n\"Oh don't look at me like that\" Allen snapped \"As if you've never lifted anything in your life. Kanda was really annoying me- acting so self riches even after I helped him fight of that crazy swordsman. He deserved to have something stolen for him! Besides, I knew it'd come in useful\" Lavi just stared in shock at the white haired boy \"You\" he said eventually with a slightly awed air \"are my new hero. Good luck with you'r akuma\" He cried before disappearing off into the crowd with Allen yelling \"OUR Akuma!\" after him. He let out a growl of irritation and turned back to face the dance floor again, shivering slightly in anticipation. He decided that he really did not like clubs one little bit. Why people would pay to come to a place like this was beyond him.\n\nLavi eventually disentangled himself from the group of girls with profuse apologies and empty promises. He glanced down at the numbers now scrawled across his hand and vaguely hoped that the fighting wouldn't wipe them off. He burst through the fire exit doors and gratefully filled his lungs with the clean cold air searching around for Allen- it didn't take too long to locate the boy- he was standing on the rooftop of one of the buildings, the almost destroyed body of a level two on the ground beneath him however Allen wasn't looking anywhere near the Akuma, he was instead staring off into the night sky. Curious, Lavi followed the young teens gaze. The Akuma exploded with a ear-splitting bang but Lavi didn't glance down. In fact he barely noticed. The cold air seemed to freeze within his lungs and his mouth dried up. He dropped his hand down to the strap holding bis hammer but even as he did so he had this overwhelming feeling of futility. They were _so_ screwed\n\n\n\t40. Chapter 40\n\n**A/N**\n\n**MidoriHikari00: Ending is explained and dragons are befriended. Aside from a teeny tiny murder attempt. But it wasn't really meant to kill... more like a dragons version of a hug. Or so I figure**\n\n**yaoiprincess101: Bwahaha yes I truelly am the evilist of authors! I didn't cliff hanger this one though. I can be nice. Sometimes. :P**\n\n**Cana99: I looooooooove Crowned Clown :D PS, I am totally making him sentient. Just for the lols. Yeah, the wizard thing is going to be some fun once the order find out!**\n\n**NirvanaFrk97: I don't really know why I like it so much- I mean I know that in canon it will never happen... I think it is just because Kanda and Allen are my two favorite characters so I like stories where they get together? I do think Kanda cares more for Allen than he lets on though. I mean, Allen sacraficed so much for him and I think after he did that, Kanda started to view him as less of an irritation and more as a friend but I do agree with you, canonically, yullen is not likely to happen :/**\n\n**coronadomontes: Why thank you :D**\n\n**Sonnenfrost: Yeah, Cross's form of protection is certainly different from most peoples... And I think I'm more or less going to make the order deny wizards existence... at least for a good long while. A clash between the two worlds would just be too impossible to write plus the way I see it, both worlds have their own problems and aren't exactly renound for helping out others in need unless it benefits them so I think they will leave each other alone until there is literally no other option. **\n\n**kiki: Meep! Sowee! No cliffhanger at the end of this I promise please don't kill me *cowers* Oh and just to point out, Harry did plenty magic before the snake thing, growing his hair, jumping up onto the school roof and shrinking one of Dudley's uglier jumpers. It doesn't actually tell you which was first so I just picked a random one :P**\n\n**midnightheula: Aww, thanks :) I will try to keep the updates consistant but this story I should warn you is turning out to be pretty much a novel. I did not intend it to be this long... still, its fun to write :D**\n\n**ennuel: What is with all the death threats! Sorry! No more cliff hangers then i guess... O.O Hope you enjoy this chapter :P**\n\n**Will of the Abyss: Haha, you're welcome! Here is another instalment**\n\n**Lalalal: Seriously! No freaking way! You're friend is epic! Send me the link or something and I'll put it in (as long as she doesn't mind me using the pic) I just found it on google (when I am bored, I search for cool pictures of anime's I love... don't ask. I just do :P)**\n\n**A shout-out to everybody. If there are any particular scenes you really want to see, just tell me and I'll happily write them in if I can- MidoriHikari00 asked for a dragon befriending moment which was somthing I hadn't thought of but loved, so I've witen it in. Hope y'all enjoy!**\n\nAllen stood stock still, completely frozen in shock as his childhood nightmare hovered in the sky above him. The same manic grin stretched impossibly across his warped face, his appearance treaded the thin line between comical and terrifying masterfully.\"Good afternoon, boy. It is nice to finally meet you. You made quite the impression on my little Road\" He leered closer and Allen raised his arm defensively, backing away slightly. Lavi snapped into action and used Hiban to join Allen\n\n\"Ooh\" sang the Earl \"Who is this now?\"\n\n\"We are exorcists\" Allen spat, his vocal chords all of a sudden un-freezing\n\n\"And we are here to destroy you and your cursed Akuma\" He knew there was no way they were going to survive this, but if they were going to die, they were going to go out with a bang. The Earl chuckled derisively\n\n\"You don't even understand what you are saying, little boy. You think I am the enemy? I don't force people to make Akuma, I offer them a deal and it is up to them whether or not they accept it. Humans are your true enemy, willing to sacrifice anything for their own happiness, yet you stinking exorcists insist on protecting them. This world is broken and I am just trying to fix it\" His voice grew harder as his speech went on, his sing-song tone changing to a harsh shout. He seemed to catch himself though and his tone became silky again\n\n\"But I don't need to tell you this do I? Yes, I remember you now… it was Mana wasn't it? You asked for your darling dead daddy back and yet when I so kindly conceded, you pulverised my painstakingly made Akuma. I should have killed you then boy\"\n\n\"Akuma are lamentable creatures\" Allen replied, his voice sad but resolute\n\n\"I see their souls and their pain. They should never be part of this world and that is why I exorcise them\"\n\nLavi lurked in the background behind Allen, silently triumphant despite the precarious position he was in. It was always the same for bookmen, the best place to record the most important parts of history was on the front lines. He was actually getting a dialogue from the Earl! He was slightly shocked that the Earl was taking such interest in Allen but that just confirmed his suspicions that there was more to Allen than he let on. Bookman was going to be so pleased. Maybe he would even forgive him for pranking him with chill flakes in his porridge…\n\n\"You can see the Akuma's soul?\" The Earl asked in a scornful tone\n\n\"You're going to save them? You impudent child. You are all nothing but pieces of my game. The tragic end of this world is already set in stone. The curtain shall raise, and so it shall begin\"\n\nOne of the Akuma hovering intimidatingly by the Earl lent toward him and hissed in his ear\n\n\"Master! Mistress Road says she needs you're help. Something to do with the Arc…\" The earl scowled internally. He had been looking forward to crushing these puny ants. It had been too long since human blood had stained his hands but the arc was more important than these children. They would die in the end anyway\n\n\"You cannot save this world no matter how hard you try\" He spat down at the boys \"Never!\"\n\nHe turned to the Akuma that had relayed Road message \"Bring all you're friends and have some fun\" He ordered before stepping through the door Road opened for him and disappearing\n\nAllen and Lavi looked about uncertainly, not entirely sure of where the Earl had disappeared to. They didn't have too long to worry about it though because the sky began to darken with innumerable Akuma, their bulbous bodies blocking out what little light the moon and stars had been giving out. Eyes wide, the two boys stubbled backwards till they were in the middle of the roof, back to back, cycling around as the Akuma gathered\n\n\"Well, I guess this is what happens when you rile the Millennium Earl\" Lavi said blithely.\n\n\"Yeah… sorry about that\" Allen replied, equally casually \"He just rubs me up the wrong way I guess. Do you wanna take that half and I'll take this?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why not\" Lavi grinned, whirling his hammer around his head\n\n\"Fire stamp: Hellfire and ash!\" He yelled at the same time Allen yelled \"Cross Grave!\" The both flung themselves at the oncoming tirade of Akuma with reckless abandon. The wave of Akuma seemed never ending and after their first charge, they boys ended up fighting back-to-back, desperately covering each other. Allen switched to his gun after slicing through the closest line of Akuma and tried to use the long distance weapon to hold them at bay while Lavi caught any that got through his barrage of bullets with Hiban. A long stream of level ones pored in from Allen's right and he was forced to leave Lavi uncovered as he frantically shot them down. He spun back to try to cover Lavi again but a level two had already broken through and was grappling with him, its claws locked onto his hammer. As Lavi struggled with the Akuma, a few level ones took advantage of the opportunity to shoot while he was unable to defend himself. Allen had no time to counter the attack but instead, he flung himself in front of his friend, taking the bullets and countering immediately with his own and he felt momentary triumph as they exploded before the level two backhanded him, sending him flying across the rooftop. He crashed painfully onto the tiles and scrambled to his feet in time to see Lavi take advantage of the opening and clobber the Akuma with a powerful hit. It flew 30, 40 metres into the air before exploding. They barely had enough time to grin triumphantly at each other before Allen yelled\n\n\"Three level two's!\" Lavi ran back to join Allen\n\n\"Ok\" He said, his tone ever so slightly nervous \"Whats the plan here?\"\n\nAllen slashed through another line of level ones and tried to bully his exhausted brain into coming up with a plan\n\n\"HIT THEM UNTIL THEY DIE!\" He roared charging forward. He flung himself to the ground as the Akuma spat out what looked like webbing. Hitting the ground hard, he rolled under the Akuma's spidery legs and sliced deeply through its underbelly. Flipping back to his feet, he yelled\n\n\"What are you waiting for!?\" Transforming his weapon into a gun, he ran around the Akuma, firing steadily as he tried to avoid the webbing which he noticed- to his great annoyance- was dissolving the tiles it touched. Lavi laughed aloud, swinging his hammer around again\n\n\"Now that is a plan I can get behind!\" He chuckled, and charged at the second level two, clipping Allen's Level two as he passed, distracting it sufficiently and allowing Allen to get another vital hit in, deep enough to sever a couple legs. The Akuma let out an ungodly shriek and vindictively launched himself at Allen, the weight of its body pinning him to the ground. The air was forcibly driven out of Allen's lungs and he lay, partially paralysed as his lungs struggled to re-inflate. His eyes widened as the Akuma drove its pincers down, aimed at Allen's innate body. He desperately tried to roll out of the way but his body seemed unwilling to obey his commands. The Akuma's pincers tore through Allen's shirt and sheared through his arm. On the plus side, the pain seemed to kick start his lungs and, taking a huge gasp of air, he stumbled away, clutching his injured arm. Scarlet blood soaked through his shirt and pooled around his feet. Trying to fight his lightheadedness, he swung his gun around and forced his innocence to the limit, letting out another barrage of bullets. Blinking away the black spots that were now dancing around his eyes, he glanced quickly over at Lavi. Once sure that Lavi was sufficiently distracted, what with the two Akuma that were now grappling with him, Allen pulled his wand out, his numb, blood covered finger struggling to hold it. Wincing, he touched the wand to his injured arm. Bandages shot out of the wand tip, tightly binding it. His blood quickly soaked through the layers but the pain deadened significantly and the high pitched ringing noise in his head quietened slightly. He took one last swipe at the Akuma before stumbling over to Lavi, not even pausing long enough to see it explode behind him. Lavi flashed Allen a grin as he joined him\n\n\"This is fun huh?\" He gasped between laboured breaths\n\nAllen nodded in agreement, trying not to think about his burning ribs or throbbing arm and instead concentrate on dodging hits from what appeared to be cleavers attached to the arms of one of the Akuma\n\n\"I'll take cleavers-for-hands and you can take mr-shape-shifter kay?\"\n\n\"Hey, no fair\" Lavi whined \"How come I get the most difficult one!\"\n\n\"Because I already killed creepy-acid-spider\" Allen retorted unsympathetically, blocking a fierce hit from his Akuma and gritting his teeth as it drove him back a good few metres. He dug his feet in the ground and ignored the loud protests from his arm as he tried to grapple free\n\n\"Urgh. Whatever. Just don't go taking all the credit for cleavers-for-hands. I already half killed him before you finished off mr-itsy-bitsy-spider\" He countered\n\nAllen stuck his tongue out at Lavi before wrestling free from cleavers-for-hands and launching a series of quick blows. The Akuma countered them well, but Allen managed to slice a line across his belly. Quickly switching to his gun, he shot down a line of level ones that were creeping up on them. He dodged away from the Akuma, which was surprisingly fast for all the size of it. Allen thankfully was faster and be led it on a merry dance as he mowed down the remaining level ones, turning every time cleavers-for-hands got too close for comfort and engaging with him again. He received another couple of cuts- one particularly painful one across his ribs but he managed to give as good as he got and eventually the fight was over. Allen spun around, scanning the skies in a nervous paranoia. His entire body was buzzing and his brain seemed unwilling to believe that it was really over. His eye however informed him otherwise. The Akuma were all gone and just as quickly as the realisation hit him, his body caught up with his brain and all of a sudden, his legs gave way beneath him and he crumpled to the ground in an exhausted heap. Lavi crumpled to the ground too a few feet away from him, his chest rising and falling rapidly. Blood trickled from cuts all over his body- his Akuma had used thin needles as his main weapon so thin cuts criss-crossed across most of his body. After a few minutes, Allen struggled to his feet and stumbled over to Lavi, offering a helping hand\n\n\"C'mon\" He mumbled, his voice weary \"We should get you to a….\" He paused for a moment as he tried to remember what the word was he was looking for \"Heal place thing\"\n\nLavi grasped his hand and only stopped himself from collapsing as soon as he stood up by falling on top of Allen. The young boy let out a grunt of pain and surprise and only just managed to remain upright himself. Putting Lavi's arm around his shoulder, he stumbled towards the fire escape stairs at the edge of the roof\n\n\"C'mon. We can do this… _hospital_!\" He cried triumphantly \"Hospital. We get you. To the hospital for healing cuts. Yes. Hospital. They'll… cuts\" Feeling very proud of himself for finding that elusive word, he almost fell over his own feet and came scarily closet to sending both Lavi and himself over the edge of the roof\n\n\"No\" He reprimanded his feet firmly\n\n\"We've been over this before. No falling. No. Remember last time? No falling\"\n\nSomehow, despite the blood loss and fog of confusion that had settled over his brain, he managed not only to reach solid ground again but he also miraculously found himself standing in front of a large white hospital. This of course had a lot to do with the fact that Timcampy had led him every step of the way by tugging on the remaining scraps of his shirt but even so, it was quite some accomplishment. Allen winced, raising one hand over his eyes\n\n\"So bright\" He mumbled. He glanced around himself \"Urgh. No light switch\" Lavi- who had been practically comatose the whole walk let out a groan \"Oh yeah!\" Allen cried, all of a sudden remembering why he was standing in from of the obnoxiously bright building\n\n\"Cuts. Yeah. Kay. Let's go\" He stumbled into the A&E giving the poor first year student who was on the desk a terrible fright\n\n\"Hello\" He said politely \"I am so sorry to bother you but my friend here is incapacitated at the present moment in time and I was wondering- if you're not too busy of course- would you mine awfully patching him up? I would do it myself you see but I appear to be rather lightheaded. Do you mind?\" He gazed hopefully up at the young girls terrified face hoping that she would comply. He really didn't think he would be able to stitch the red-head up himself. He was just so terribly tiered.\n\n\"O-of course not\" The bemused girl replied \"I-I'll get the doctor right away. You just wait here\" At which point she promptly scarpered, running off to find someone more senior to take responsibility for the two boys before they bled out before her eyes. Allen let out a sigh of relief and lowered Lavi to the ground. He made to walk out the door then on second thought tucked Lavi's jacket under his head\n\n\"Night\" He murmured before weaving unsteadily out the door where he promptly summoned his broom. He had barely flown more than a few metres before he passed out. It was probably quite lucky, as he wasn't high enough for any real damage to be done. It was also lucky that he had the wits to cast a disillusionment charm over himself before take off. Tim flapped panickedly around his master's body for a bit but after deciding that he wasn't going to wake up any time soon, he flew off to fetch the headmaster\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen came round slowly. His head ponded painfully, throbbing with each heart beat. His arm and rib soon began to vie for his attention as well. His eyes cracked open and he winced again as the bright light sent another shard of pain through his body. He gave an internal sigh of relief once he noticed that he was not-as he expected- lying in some dark smelly alleyway but instead was in the now-very-familiar pristine hospital wing. He swallowed with difficulty then tried again, opening his eyes properly. Very slowly, his pain began to ebb away and his brain began to power up again. Madame Pomfrey (using what he could only assume was the 6th sense those of the medical profession developed) walked up to his bedside before he could even call for her. She sighed long-sufferingly as she poured a deep purple mixture into a small beaker which she gently fed to him, softly scolding him for being so reckless. His pain died down even further and he began to feel slightly more human.<p>\n\n\"You have a visitor\" Madame Promfrey said sternly as if she disapproved of such things\n\n'No more than 15 minutes mind and don't you even THINK of getting up. I'm not about to let you ruin all my hard work\" She gave him a scowl but it wasn't quite as stern as usual though so he took this as a good sign. He painfully forced his battered body into a sitting position and just had time to register the small mound of sweets at the foot of his bed when Harry walked in. He looked even more stressed than usual\n\n\"Allen, please, _please_ tell me you know some really ridiculously rare spell that can be used to defeat dragons\"\n\nAllen blinked confusedly. Maybe the blood loss was making him hallucinate. He really hoped not because that would mean he was not lying on a clean, freshly made bed and was in fact lying in some dirty puddle in a back alleyway somewhere in London. In which case he was probably currently dying of sepsis. Which would explain the hallucinations he supposed. Harry waved his hand in front of Allen's face\n\n\"Did you get concussion as well as lacerating… well… pretty much your entire body?\" He asked impatiently\n\n\"Err… no?\" Allen replied. This was one weird hallucination\n\n\"Soooo….\" Harry said impatiently. Allen cocked his head to one side confusedly\n\n\"_Dragons_!\" Harry yelled irritably. Allen jumped and winced\n\n\"I don't know anything about dragons!' He groaned \"I _did_ almost die you know\" A whiny note creeping into his voice \"Why're you bugging me about dragons?\"\n\n\"Oh come on\" Scoffed Harry \"You've been in much worse shape than this and you know it. I however have never before been mauled to death by dragons in front of my cheering classmates so yeah… if you could tell me a way to avoid that, I'd be _super_ grateful\"\n\nAllen was not impressed by the heavily sarcastic tone however he had finally figured out what Harry was babbling on about- the Triwizard Tournament. Dragon's he guessed must be the first task. Seriously. You would think that a small society like wizards would try to keep their children alive rather than throw as many dangerous things at them as possible and hope for the best.\n\n\"OK\" he said slowly \"So you need to defeat a dragon? Wait… how do you know about them? Aren't the tasks supposed to be a secret or whatever? How did you…\"\n\n\"Focus Allen\" Harry yelled snapping his fingers underneath Allen's nose \"Me getting mauled to death by evil vicious dragons! How am I supposed to avoid that happening?!\"\n\n\"Ah… yeah… err… I don't suppose you covered how to slay dragons in class while I was unconscious?\"\n\n\"If we had I wouldn't be asking you, would I?\" Harry moaned, dropping his head into his hands \"I'm gonna die aren't I?\"\n\n\"Oh no\" Allen said bracingly \"I'm sure one of the teachers will intervene before it _kills_ you. You will probably get some burns however\" He struggled to hold back a smile at Harry's expression\n\n\"Oh come on! Don't look at me like that! Of course I'll help. Look, just go to the library and get me a few books out. I'll help you with the spell searching alright? Now bugger off before Madame Pomfrey blows a fuse\"\n\nThe pile of sweets are the end of his bed were soon replaced with stack of books. Not only did he have to help Harry find a way to defeat a freaking _dragon_ he had to cover all the stuff he had missed in class and finish his homework. The teachers seemed to have covered the entire course\n\nin the time he was away. They certainly were't kidding around this year. On the plus side however, at least he wasn't driving Madame Pomfrey mad this stay in the hospital wing. Every time previously he had been snapping at her heels to let him go however this time, he was more than willing to wait for as long as was needed. The quiet of the ward was actually very helpful, not to mention that Madame Pomfrey showed up at frequent intervals to give him medicine for pain which helped exponentially with his headaches. He was buried waist deep in books when Ron came through the doors. Allen didn't notice him until he snapped his fingers beneath his nose. Allen jumped violently and dropped the book he was holding on Ron's foot. Ron let out a stream of violent swear words as he hopped around the room on his good foot\n\n\"What the bloody hell do you think you're doing\" He roared, lowering himself gingerly onto the seat beside Allen's bed and massaging his bruised limb\n\n\"You scared me!\" Allen protested \"Sorry about that\" Ron grumbled something unintelligible and glanced suspiciously at the pile of books beside him\n\n\"So you believe he didn't put his name in\" He said bitterly. It wasn't even question. Allen noticed that Ron looked just as miserable as Harry had and he sighed.\n\n\"Yes, I believe he had nothing to do about it but really, it doesn't matter whether he did or not does it? Regardless of whether it was him or someone else, he still has to participate in games which will probably kill him.\" He considered telling Ron that Harry was going up against dragons but decided that the fewer people who knew about Harry breaking the rules the better.\n\n\"Look\" He said patiently \"I get that you're angry. Harry has a knack for finding danger and getting neck deep in it but you're his mate aren't you? I mean sure he is a pain sometimes but he always has your back. I mean just think about how many times he has risked his life for yours or for someone else. He is a good guy and you know it. Besides, you know that he always has a good reason for getting neck deep in trouble… well… he always has a reason anyways\" Ron scowled but didn't retort which Allen took as a good sign. He offered Ron a couple chocolate frogs (Neat! I finally got Agrippa!) and helped him out with a torturingly painful potions essay after which Ron seemed significantly less bitter and much more like his usual self. With a sigh, Allen returned to his pile of books, deeply hoping that he would, like, come across a chapter titled 'How To Knock Out An Angry Dragon'\n\n* * *\n\n><p>As Allen watched a tiny Harry-sized dot zoom around the stadium, he began to feel significantly better about the book <em>not<em> containing a chapter titled 'How To Knock Out An Angry Dragon' . Besides, this way was significantly cooler than just knocking the animal out, even if it did increase the chance of receiving third degree burns. He cheered himself horce when Harry somehow succeeded in getting the golden egg and escaped with only minor burns. He smiled inwardly when Ron ran down the stand to meet his now-not-so-ex ex-friend. Allen hoped that this encounter was more successful than the last one which he had heard ended with Harry flinging something at Ron's face. Deciding to give them some space, he left the stadium with the rest of the spectators but he had barely gotten more than a few feet before Luna caught up with him\n\n\"Hey Allen. Do you want to come help me?\" She said, smiling sweetly\n\n\"Err… depends on what with\" Allen replied trepediously, knowing full well the crazy things Luna got up to in her spare time\n\n\"With the dragons of course\" She replied as if he was being slow. Not even noticing his stunned expression she carried on\n\n\"You know, wizards think they are soooo superior to muggles but muggles banned sports like bear baiting many years ago where as we still chain up innocent creature and hurt them for sport\" Her airy fairy tone had faded slightly and she looked rather upset\n\n\"Of course\" Allen said, slightly taken aback by how upset she was, though now he thought about it, he realised that he agreed with her. He followed her through the crowd to the forbidden forrest where Ron's older brother was forcing a keening Chinese Fireball into the enclosure. Its eyes were streaming but its wails… Not wails of pain. Allen knew that much. It was crying for its crushed eggs. Its children which were now gone forever. Allen immediately followed it, he received a few pots of multicoloured goop from one of Charlie's dragon tamer friends along with strict instructions not to get burnt because it would mean an unholy amount of paperwork. Allen dodged around the dragons bad tempered pumas of flame, feeling bad that he was grateful Krum had half-blinded the Chinese Fireball. He deftly ran up the dragons chained foreleg and- ducking to avoid the snapping jaws- settled down on the back of its head, behind the huge horny spikes that crowned its head. He carefully reached around the protrusions and, holding his wand between his teeth, he began to clean out the streaming eyes. The dragon screamed ear piercingly but after a while, seemed to realise that Allen was helping and to his great relief, it quietened. He unscrewed the lid from one of the jars and, wriggling closer to the head, he spread the thick, pink goop around the eye, murmuring comforting words into its ear as he did so. The dragons keening mellowed to a whimper and Allen felt a tug at his heartstrings. Stupid wizards and their stupid traditions and their stupid stupidity. He scowled as he dropped some pale blue eyes drops into the creatures bloodshot eyes and petted its nose, steering well clear of its jaws. He scooted around again to the other side of the dragons head, gripping tightly onto its neck with his legs. He repeated the process with the other eye and gingerly lent down to pet her nose again with his shaking hand.\n\n\"Hey Allen!\" Luna called up softly \"Charlie says we need to go now. Past curfew\" Allen nodded in agreement and slid back down off the dragons neck. He landed messily beside Luna and accepted her helping hand up\n\n\"She seems to like you\" Luna said sweetly \"Mine thankfully was OK once we gave her a sedative. Ooh, watch out. Protegro\" All this was said in exactly the same dreamy tone and Allen slowly turned around to see the shield holding back a wall of flames. Shaking slightly, he turned around to face Luna again\n\n\"Aaah… thanks for saving my skin\" He gasped\n\n\"Not a problem\" she sang \"Lets go\"\n\nNodding shakily, Allen joined Luna and they walk side by side back to the castle, their wands cutting thin lines of light through the darkness.\n\n\n\t41. Chapter 41\n\n**A/N- This is a slightly different layout from usual so yell at me if you don't like it. I feel sort of bad because Mai doesn't appear once in this chapter- I don't want to drop her from the story but she just didn't seem to fit in :/ That may become something of a trend as the story moves on...**\n\n**Also, I changed Allen's prophesy slightly as well as the time-line of the story**\n\n**Artistic licence :D**\n\n**PS- ****apologiesforthecliffhangerimreallysorrypleasedontk illme :'(**\n\n**Rex888- I love a little bit of Luna- she is among my favorite characters from Harry Potter! So ditzy!**\n\n**NirvanaFrk97- I know Allen would do it for all his friends but that isn't the point- most people wouldn't- I mean Kanda is so unfriendly that most people wouldn't feel any obligation even to be nice to him so the fact that Allen sacraficed so much for him ****_does_**** count for something but yeah, lets stop this argument. I know canonically its not gonna happen, I just like the idea and besides, I'm not putting that in this story. This is a Laven, or will be. Eventually. Besides, my pairings aren't even the focus of this story so that will very much be in the background**\n\n**Ennuel- Thanks- even if you're review was rather threatening, its nice to know you like the story that much! Here is another update. On;y took a week that time! Hope you like...**\n\n**PoisonousDeamon- I kno rite :P Erm, the order will... exactly when and how, I have not yet decided :S that will be HARD to write. Think I might have Allen tell them but they won't believe him- think its a ploy of the 14th or something. I'll see :D**\n\nAllen yawned widely as he slowly climbed the staircase up to the Gryfindor common room. He tried to force his weary body to move faster when he looked at the time but his legs felt like they were made of lead and wouldn't obay his commands. He had just rounded the final staircase when he almost walked strait into the back of a figure about to enter one of the now-empty classrooms\n\n\"Sorry!\" He cried in surprise then when he saw who it was\"Hang on, you're not supposed to be in the castle are you?\"\n\nRita Skeeter turned round, a bright grin plastered across her face, her white teeth bared in what was probably supposed to be a winning smile\n\n\"Oh, I didn't see you there dear!\" She edged her way around Allen before pausing\n\n\"Wait a moment, you are a friend of Harry's right?\"\n\nAllen eyed her warily\n\n\"Yes, I am\" He answered shortly, unable to think of a reason not to answer the seemingly innocent question but still unwilling to engage with the strange woman\n\n\"So… how do you feel after seeing you're school friend defeat such a dangerous opponent? Proud? Pleased? Nervous?\" She had produced a quill and scroll of parchment from nowhere and the quill was already flying across the parchment with hurried excitement. Allen was torn. He knew he shouldn't be talking to her after seeing the report she had done on Harry but he was trapped and couldn't think of any polite way to excuse himself. Rita raised an expecting eyebrow at him\n\n\"Erm, I am relieved of course that he wasn't badly hurt\" Allen said awkwardly, wishing desperately the age could see what the quill was writing down. Rita's smile widened even further\n\n\"Well of course you are, you must have been so worried. Tell me, how long have you known Harry?\"\n\n\"3 years\" Allen replied\n\n\"And what sort of a person is he? Brave? Reckless?\" Rita fired back immediately, clearly not planning on letting him go any time soon\n\n\"Well, he certainly is brave. He is the sort of person that would do anything to protect those he cared about\" Allen stated firmly, trying as hard as he could not to give her anything to work with. He tried to back away toward the portrait but\n\n\"And do you think he put his name into the goblet?\" Rita asked sharply. Allen stopped, his face serious\n\n\"No. Harry would never do something like that. He knows how dangerous the competition is and he is not so arrogant as to believe that he is invincible. Someone put his name in for some reason and he is now having to pay the consequences\"\n\nRita's face fell slightly and then her questioning turned course suddenly\n\n\"You are the young boy that Dumbledore adopted are you not?\" She asked\n\nBlinking in surprise, Allen nodded\n\n\"Could you tell me more perhaps about your arrival in Hogwarts? I hear there was some problem with the ministry but they don't tell me too much\" at this she giggled in what was clearly supposed to be a ditzy way but to Allen, it sounded awfully intimidating\n\n\"I-I'm not quite sure what you mean\" He stuttered slightly. A scary gleam lit her eyes\n\n\"Something to do with what gave you that scar\" She pushed, her eyes raking his face. Allen gulped slightly, his mind spinning into blind panic- what should he say?\n\n\"The ministry did question me on the wizard who gave me this scar\" He said slowly, weighing each word\n\n\"As far as I'm aware there was no real problem about it. I'm afraid you'll need to ask the ministry about that. I'd better go. It's past curfew time. You should leave too\" He backed away to the portrait hole and scrambled through with Rita's words echoing behind him\n\n\"Oh, I'll ask them…\"\n\nAllen slipped through the masses of people who all seemed to have changed their minds about Harry being a cheat and were all wholeheartedly celebrating his win. He struggled through to Harry and gave his friend a one armed hug which was the best he could manage with all the people milling around, cheering as Neville turned into a yellow canary\n\n\"Congratulations!\" He yelled over the loud whoops of the students as George and Fred's cleverly disguised trick foods began to take effect on more people\n\n\"That was quite a performance out there!\" Allen enthused, grinning \"Let's see the egg\" Harry dug into his pocket and pulled the shining egg out. It was about the same size as his head and was ornately decorated. The Gryfindor's quietened reverently as he pulled it out\n\n\"Open it Harry! Go on!\" Lee Jordan called over the crowd and the rest of them quickly joined in, clamouring for him to open it. Harry grinned and dug his fingers into the groove around the centre of the egg and with some difficulty, prised it open. An uneasily screech filled the room, its piercing tone drowning out every sound and filling the ears of the Gryfindor's. Allen along with those nearest Harry hit the ground, their hands over their ears\n\n\"SHUT IT UP!\" Fred yelled, his face twisted into a grimace but Harry didn't need to be told that. He slammed the thing shut and the silence felt almost as deafening as the shriek\n\n\"What\" Seamus Finnegan said weakly \"Was that?\" But no one had any idea and all of a sudden everyone was looking at Harry with something more akin to pity in their eyes than fierce pride. Harry himself felt the elation of beating the dragon wearing off and the now-familiar feeling of trepidation fill his chest\n\nAllen turned to his friend with a weak smile on his face\n\n\"Bet the dragon's feel like a walk in the park now huh?\" Harry nodded, laughing shakily\n\n\"Oh by the way\" Allen continued, his face grim \"I was accosted by Rita in the corridor before I came here so brace yourself for another scintillating article in the newspaper any time soon. Harry rolled his eyes irritably\n\n\"She was probably trying to sneak into the common room to see what the clue for the next task was. I wouldn't mind feeding her to the dragon\" Allen shook his head disapprovingly\n\n\"Look, I know after that task your feelings towards dragons aren't exactly friendly but really, thats taking it a bit too far. No creature deserves that!\" Ron, who overheard this joined in the laughter and even Hermione looked somewhat amused though she scolded them none the less.\n\nEventually, Professor McGonnagle lost her temper with them and sent the lot of them trooping moodily back to their rooms. Final congratulations were offered to Harry as they all filed into their dorms and even once they reached their rooms, Neville and Seamus insisted that Harry give a blow-by-blow account of the whole thing again and the sky was already beginning to lighten before they fell into an exhausted slumber\n\n* * *\n\n><p>It was with some considerable trepidation that Allen opened the newspaper the next morning and sure enough, just a few pages in, there was a blown up picture of him. Exactly when it had been taken, he had no idea but it must have been not too long after he had arrived at Hogwarts because his eyes were wide and wild, his skin dirty and bandages swathed most of his body. In short, he looked somewhat insane. The headline read<p>\n\n\"_**Our Champion's Friend: Innocent As He Seems?**_\" This was going to be good\n\n\"_Harry Potter, the youngest ever Triwizrd champion has just risen victorious over the most dangerous tasks ever- bravely taking on a dragon and triumphing over his competitors, however our belovéd champion may be in danger: Not from dragons, nor indeed from any of the perils he will undoubtably come across in the Triwizard Tournament but rather from within the school\"_\n\nAllen- who was reading this aloud to his friends raised his eyes and widened them dramatically \"Ooh, I have shivers running up my spine!\" He gasped \"I wonder what the danger could possibly be!\" Ron smirked back and Allen continued\n\n_\"Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived has been discovered to keep some rather strange company_\n\n_'He always was attracted to the weird one's' I was informed by one of my confidants in Hogwarts- a well behaved student from a good family- 'I offered my friendship to him in my first year but he turned me down and instead made friends with Hermione Granger- a muggle born witch who seems to have an infatuation with him, Ron Weasly- who is from a very poor background and frequently borrows money from him and Allen Walker- a strange boy who appeared with no explanation in our second year, when all the strange attacks began on the students. He is a very strange boy and most of the students are scared of him'_\n\nAllen glanced up again\n\n\"I wonder who her confidential source could possibly be\" He said cooly and they all exchanged dark looks. _Malfoy_\n\n\"Oooh, look\" Allen continued \"They even got a quote from a ministry official!\"\n\n_\" I enquired about Allen's mysterious appearance and one of the ministers who oversaw his entry into Hogwarts gave me a statement_\n\n_'Yes, I was one of the first on scene when Allen Walker arrived at Hogwarts. He told us some cock-and-bull story about a dark wizard who cursed him, causing his hair to turn white and that scar to appear on his face. If you ask me, that story soundsvery familiar, if you get my drift' As a reporter of some reputation, I of course have seen my fair share of famous people in my time and very frequently, they are plagued by copy-cats- in other words, fanatic fans that try to emulate them. Some even go to extreme lengths. Is it possible that this boy, who is said to have no parents, latched on to Harry's story and made all of this up just to get close to him? This reporter would just like to say to the boy we are all rooting for: Be careful! Not everyone is as innocent as they first seem…'_\n\nAllen dropped the paper onto the table as if it was a poisonous spider. His face was disgusted\n\n\"Well, there you go\" Harry said, equally cooly \"I guess I had better break off all contact with you huh? Seeing as how you are planning on killing me and taking my place. Us being so similar and all- what with your white hair and completely differently shaped scar\" They laughed at this and noticed Draco's annoyed expression at the Slytherin's table. He obviously had expected them to be more upset by this but refusing to allow him the satisfaction, they returned to their breakfast and began to discuss the many, _many_ ways they could kill Rita Skeeter without being sent to Azkaban\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen, Ron and Harry were hunched in a circle around one of the roaring braziers that had been set up in the courtyard fire as snow whipped around them, melting as they came into contact with the ward air<p>\n\n\"Its stupid!\" Ron was protesting, his voice indignant\n\n\"Why can't all the available one's just, like, put their names up on a board or something and then if you wanted to take them, you could just, like pick the name and have done with it!\" Harry and Allen rolled their eyes at each other\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that counts as objectifying them Ron\" Allen admonished \"Just find a girl you like and want to spend time with then ask her if she wants to go. Its not that hard\" He yawned widely, and rubbed his eyes, shivering\n\n\"I wish they would stop setting so much homework\" He muttered \"Between that and Akuma-hunting, I think I might drop dead any moment from exhaustion\"\n\n\"Well why haven't you done it yet then!?\" Ron yelled exasperatedly\n\n\"_What_?\" Allen and Harry chorused indignantly\n\n\"Asked a girl out of course\" Ron said looking rather bemused at their reaction\n\n\"Oh yeah\" Allen said thoughtfully \"Forgot I needed to get someone too. I'm a crazy-stalker-psycho though, remember- doubt anyone will be that willing to go with me after Rita's article\"\n\nRon snorted \"You're just as scared as we are\" He said, jerking his thumb at himself and Harry. Allen raised an eyebrow, his eyes dancing\n\n\"Oh really?\" He said teasingly \"Challenge accepted\" and with that, he strode away.\n\nExchanging disbelieving looks, Harry and Ron followed. Allen walked up to a group of Ravenclaw students and smiled politely\n\n\"Excuse me, could I please talk to Luna privately?\" He asked courteously. The girls immediately dissolved into giggles and parted to let Luna through, she stepped delicately though the snow and Allen led her a little away from the group.\n\nNot entirely believing their eyes, Harry and Ron followed, surreptitiously edging their way around so they could effectively eavesdrop\n\n\"Luna\" Allen began confidently and Ron and Harry raised their eyebrows disbelievingly at each other- he was actually going to do it!\n\n\"I was wondering if anyone has asked you to the Yule Ball yet?\" The girl who Harry vaguely recognised having seen her talking to Allen a few times previously shook her head\n\n\"No, in fact I've never been asked to a dance before. I have danced before though. Do you know that the blubbering humdinger dances sometimes\" She said dreamily and Ron let out a snort of amusement\n\n\"She's a nutter!\" He whispered to Harry \"Even if she does say yes, I don't think that should count\" But Allen just laughed at this\n\n\"Really? That'd be pretty amazing to see. Anyway, I was wondering if you would like to go to the dance with me- I've never been to a dance before and it'd be nice to have a friend there with me to help me through it!\" He laughed slightly and smiled rather nervously. Luna's pale blue eyes widened even further\n\n\"Really? I'd love to. I've never been asked to anything before. It's a nice feeling\" Allen grinned and hugged her swiftly\n\n\"Thanks Luna, you're a life-saver! I'll meet you outside the Great Hall?\" Luna nodded and Allen waved good-bye before joining Harry and Ron, both of whom were staring slack-jawed at him\n\n\"And _that_\" He said impressively smoothing down his robes \"is how you do it\"\n\n\"You're mental mate\" Ron said, laughing \"She's completely loopy\"\n\nAllen frowned at him, actually looking rather irritated\n\n\"She's nice\" He said stubbornly \"She's been kind to me even though the majority of the population of Hogwarts is now avoiding me and she's sweet so please don't insult her in front of me\" He strode away, looking vaguely irritated. Harry was slightly shocked by this reaction- he didn't think he had ever seen Allen get so worked up over something so small- that was Ron's job\n\n\"Yeah, but the only reason she talks to him is because the world she lives in doesn't have Daily Prophet's- only Blubbering Humdingers and Abominable Snowmen!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen nervously straitened the red neck tie so it sat more smoothly against his shirt. He had looked at the magazine Dean Thomas had lent him of dress robes and had promptly thrown it out, swearing never to be caught dead in such ridiculous things. If there was one thing he knew how to do, it was dress like a gentlemen and those… those <em>things<em> were an abomination. He hoped that the large student body would distract the teachers enough that they wouldn't notice. He know it was part of the dress code but _really_. No. He had bought a perfectly acceptable black suit with a long black tail coat he hoped would hide the fact that he was wearing trousers and a new white shirt, crisply ironed and perfectly creased. He had even- in a state of madness- purchased a tall, black top hat which he had to admit, he liked a lot. He was adjusting his white gloves for the fifth time when Luna walked down the stairs. He gaped slightly as he saw her. She _did_ look amazing, just… ever so slightly odd. Her pale blonde hair was swept into a messy pony-tail at the side of her head and multi-coloured feathers poked out, mixed in with her hair. Her dress was dark blue till the waist where half of the skirt carried on in the same dark blue material and the other half burst into an explosion of more multicoloured feathers. She smiled widely when she saw him and he noticed that she had applied- rather impressively- multicoloured eyeshadow. He bowed politely as she approached him and was unable to keep an amused smile off his face\n\n\"You look lovely\" He said sincerely \"And to think that I was worried my corsage wouldn't match your outfit\" He teased, gesturing at the bright feathers, then holding out the small posy of flowers he had picked from the greenhouse under the observation of a misty-eyed Professor Sprout who seemed very taken by his request to pick some of the nicer flowers in the schools collection for Luna's corsage\n\nLuna smiled, seemingly unaware of how bizarre her outfit was as she accepted the mixture of silver and purple flowers from Allen\n\n\"Dad says that the more colours you wear to a dance, the greater chance you have of the fairies blessing you\" She said seriously. Allen looked down at his monochromatic outfit and laughed\n\n\"Guess I'm not getting a blessing then\" he said lightheartedly. Luna surveyed his outfit seriously, seeming not to have noticed it tip he pointed it out\n\n\"No, I don't think you will. I like it though\" She said seriously, as if worried he would be upset at the idea of not getting the blessings of the fairies. Chuckling Allen offered Luna his arm and they walked through to the great hall, jointing their fellow classmates. Allen and Luna bullied their way to the front of the crowd and strained for a glimpse of the champions. Allen grinned at Harry as he walked in with Parvati. Parvati looked stunning and was smiling excitedly at her friends but Harry looked as if he had just been forced to eat a tray of Hagrid's treacle. He looked distinctly lock jawed as he smiled rather forcefully to the crowd but very soon people weren't looking at him. Whispers and nudges rippled through the gaggle of students as Victor Krum walked through the door with Hermione on his arm! Allen's jaw dropped. No wonder she hadn't wanted to tell them who she was going with. Oh Ron was gonna be _so_ furious. He glanced over and sure enough, Ron had the same lock-jawed look that Harry had been sporting earlier. This wasn't going to end well. Hermione glance through the crowd and her eyes found Allen's. He nodded encouragingly at her and mouthed \"You look amazing\" She flushed and smiled nervously before turning to face Krum.\n\nLuna plucked his arm\n\n\"Was that you're friends Hermione?\" Allen nodded as the band struck up a mournful tune and the champions began to swirl around the dance floor\n\n\"She looks different\" Luna said, mild surprise in her tone. Allen nodded again\n\n\"Yeah, she sure does. Would you like to dance?\" He offered his arm again and Luna took it. Dancing wasn't nearly as hard as he thought it was going to be- after working as an acrobat a few times in the circus, he had gained a pretty good sense of rhythm and he was good at picking up a routine so soon he and Luna were cutting a wide swathe through the students as they swirled round and round the dance floor. Luna kept the conversation going with no difficulty, telling him about how the Ministry were training post owls to read so that they could steal information about their voters. She had just moved onto the coverup the ministry and done with Fudge- who she claimed was actually a well-disguised Hag- when Dumbledore announced that food was there for those who wanted it and tables appeared out of nowhere, golden plates and cutlery adorning them.\n\nAllen and Luna joined Ron and Harry. Ron was stony-faced and Padma looked rather frightened of him and Harry just looked harassed and clearly wished he was somewhere else- what with Percy talking his ear off about some promotion he had. Allen was digging into a huge shepherds pie when Hermione spun over to them, staggering slightly, a huge grin on her face. She plopped down on the chair that Parvati had just vacated, fanning herself with a napkin\n\n\"Hot, isn't it? Victor's gone to get drinks\"\n\nRon's look was rather frighting to behold\n\n\"_Victor_\" He scoffed \"Hasn't asked you to call him _Vicky_ yet has he?\"\n\nHermione looked at him in shock and Allen rolled his eyes. This could only go badly\n\n\"You're dress is really lovely Hermione\" He said, desperately trying to smooth over Ron's rudeness but there was no covering up the glare Ron was now pinning Hermione with\n\n\"What's up with you?\" She asked, ignoring Allen completely\n\n\"If you don't know, I'm not telling you\" Ron sniped childishly. Hermione looked around in confusion to Harry who shook his head then to Allen who quietly said\n\n\"I think Ron has a problem with you're dance partner\"\n\nHermione whipped her head around again to Ron\n\n\"He's from Durmstrang!\" Ron bellowed, his face red \"He's competing against Harry! Against Hogwarts! You- You are- You're fraternising with the enemy you are!\" There was a soft thud as Allen dropped his head onto the table\n\nMan was Ron ever an idiot. Why did he have to be so emotionally stunted that he couldn't just tell the girl that he fancied her! The argument raged on over his head and he only raised it when Hermione, too upset for words, ran from the table\n\n\"Do you mind?\" He asked Luna pleadingly \"I'm really sorry to abandon you\" but Luna just shook her head\n\n\"She's your friend\" She said simply \"You need to go\" he ran after Hermione's disappearing figure, throwing a promise to come back over his shoulder.\n\nNarrowly avoiding a few elbows to the face, Allen eventually exited the Great Hall and, more slowly now, followed hermione to where she slumped down on one of the stone benches in the courtyard. He sat down beside her silently and offered her his handkerchief. Wordlessly she accepted it and dabbed at her eyes. She really did look amazing, Allen thought. Of course, she had always been pretty but he guessed that seeing her in the same uniform and the same classes every day had sort of made them miss the changes and only now that tradition was broker did the changes seem quite so apparent. She swept her now-sleek hair over her ears and sniffed\n\n\"You should get back. Luna. She'll be missing you. Seeing as how you actually were dancing with her\" Allen gave a small laugh\n\n\"Yeah, Harry and Ron's partners were definitely looking a little fed up! Don't worry about Luna. She understands\" Hermione looked up at him, her eyes slightly red and bloodshot\n\n\"You really like her don't you\" She said\n\nAllen shrugged one shoulder, well aware that she was avoiding the subject and deciding to let her do so\n\n\"She's really nice yeah. I'm just not quite sure if I just like her or like, like her if you know what I mean\" He said, slipping his jacket off and wrapping it around her shoulders. She gratefully pulled it closer to her\n\n\"I know what you mean\" She said in a small voice \"It's the same with Victor. He is really nice and of course he is good looking but…\" She trailed off then as if she had been dying to confide in someone she rushed recklessly on \"It's just… he so famous and has the pick of so many girls you know? But he chose me- no one has ever looked at me in _that_ way before and… I'm not sure if I like him for who he is or if I just like him because he is paying attention to me\" She wiped her eyes again and looked up at Allen. He hugged her to him comfortingly\n\n\"Well, I think you owe it to yourself to find out. Wipe your tears, man up and go back in there then dance till your feet feel like they are going to fall off. Maybe it'll become something and maybe it won't but you deserve to find out for yourself, not have Ron decide for you\" Her jaw tightened at the mention of his name\n\n\"You are beautiful, Hermione\" Allen added softly \"But it's not just that, you are kind and smart and a loyal friend. Anyone would be lucky to have you so go back in there and have the best night of your life, okay?\" She nodded, giving a rather watery smile and shrugged off Allen's jacket offering it back to him\n\n\"You have a good night too\" She murmured impulsively giving him a quick hug before turning around and re-entering the main hall.\n\nAllen re-joined the dance not long after Hermione left and rescued a rather shell-shocked Beuxbaton's boy from Luna's ravings. He danced a few of the dances with Hermione- who seemed to have taken his words to heart and was smiling just as brightly as before. Eventually, as the night turned into the early hours of day, the teachers began to steer everyone out, silencing the music and turning the lights out one at a time with a wave of their wands. Allen and Luna made their way up to her common room as soon as the teachers began to hint at the dance closing up before the students began to stampede out, chased by the irate grown-ups. Allen slowed as they reached the portrait and they both stood awkwardly for a while\n\n\"T-thanks for coming with me\" Allen said, breaking the silence and cursing his own voice for shaking. He wasn't really sure what to do at this point- all he could think of was how tiered he was yet something told him that the day wasn't quite done yet. Luna smiled back to him\n\n\"I had a really great time\" She said gently \"Thank you for inviting me. Most people wouldn't bother. I'm too weird\" Her matter of fact voice upset Allen for some reason\n\n\"You're brilliant\" He said gruffly \"Anyone who thinks differently is stupid\" She smiled slightly at that and Allen impulsively lent down and kissed her gently on the lips. It was short and sweet, he drew back quickly, blushing to the roots of his white hair\n\n\"I-er-I.. um… h-hope you have a good night. I- er- I'll see you later. Night\" And he fled the scene, his face burning and his heart thudding far too loudly _hope you have a good night? _what the heck had he been thinking. With a groan he ran his fingers through his hair. This was all too complicated for him. He needed someone to hand him an instruction booklet for _life. _Why was everything so confusing and awkward. He entered the portrait to hear Hermione scream, her voice breaking slightly\n\n\"Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\" Ron bellowed back, his face a horrible shade of puce \"What's that then\"\n\n\"Next time there's a ball, ask be before someone else does, and_not _as a last resort!\" She turned and ran up to her room, crying softly\n\n\"Well\" Ron spluttered \"well- that just proves- completely misses the point-\" Stony faced, Allen strode up to Ron and slapped him hard around the back of his head\n\n\"Oi!\" Ron yelled furiously \"What was that for?\"\n\nAllen however had had enough of his childishness\n\n\"That\" He hissed \"is for making one of my best friends cry with your insensitive and immature behaviour! Hermione is perfectly free to date whomever she pleases and _you _have no right whatsoever to judge her for it!\" Ron clenched his fists\n\n\"Shut up\" He yelled back \"What would you know anyway? You've not known her as long as we have and you're hardly even _here,_spending half you're life goodness-only knows where\"\n\n\"And yet\" Allen seethed \"I still notice her more than you\"\n\nThat, it seemed was too much for Ron and he swing a wild punch at Allen's head. Allen ducked almost lazily beneath it and grabbed his arm before he could throw another blow, twisting it behind his back. He held it there, not too tightly to hurt but tightly enough to make a point. Ron struggled for a bit but was unable to break his grip. Allen let go once he was sure Ron wouldn't retaliate again and with a furious growl, Ron stalked off to the dorm. Allen sat down rather shakily on one of the chairs, slightly regretting his actions\n\n\"OK, maybe I shouldn't have hit him\" He said begrudgingly at the look Harry was giving him\n\n\"Ya think?\" Harry retorted but then he sighed wearily \"Actually I'm sort of glad you did. I could hardly do that seeing as how we have only just made up but he definitely needed it. Don't know what has gotten into him recently\" He wearily rubbed his face, sitting down beside Allen\n\n\"By the way, got some interesting stuff to tell you\" And he then began to tell Allen all that had gone on out in the grounds- discovering Hagrid was a giant, seeing Karkarov and Snape together… it was with a spinning head that Allen finally collapsed into his bed and his dreams were swirling and strange. He woke up from a particularly vivid one where Karkarov was feeding him multicoloured feathers when he decided that enough was enough. He needed to clear his head. Grabbing his black robes, he rolled out of bed, checking the bedside clock\n\n3 in the morning. Plenty time for a good scout, especially since it was the weekend and none would be expecting him to be about too early on. He was making his way down the stairs when he came across a very drunk Professor Trewlany\n\n\"Whogoezthere\" She slurred, squinting through her oversized glasses \"AH!\" She exclaimed loudly, casing Allen to wince and look around, hoping none heard\n\n\"Itz you iznt it? You left my class\" She seemed to be very sad at this thought \"I liked you in my class… such an interesting subject. Do you want me to read your cards\" She asked, looming closer. Allen shook his head wildly and backed away, he had barely made it more than a few steps however when a harsh voice caused him to stop\n\n\"He has set his stage for the final act\" He turned around and was shocked to see the voice emerging from Trewlany. Her arms were dangling loosely by her side and her head was thrown back, eyes wide. She looked possessed\n\n\"The curtain will drop and his players shall begin to move. Two worlds, never supposed to meet shall collide with disastrous results. Before once they have met and this fated alliance will cause unprecedented destruction\" She drew a shuddering breath. Allen stood frozen by fear- what was happening? Her eyes swivelled around and locked on his\n\n\"The darkness will swallow you, and you will lose the one who is dear to you. You, the prophesied destroyer of time who shall meet the Earl in battle as the fates have set. The fight will be to the death. A soul for a soul. The price that must be payed. Such a sad fate. God's tragic clown.\" Her voice grew melancholy but retained its deep, harshness \"Such a sad fate. A soul of darkness for a soul of light. The price.. must… be payed\" Her voice trailed off and she was silent for some time then snorted loudly and jerked upright\n\n\"Oh deary me\" He said, her voice high and misty once again \"Think I may have taken a little too much sherry\" She giggled slightly then composed herself\n\n\"You shouldn't' be out of bed at this time! I should report you to McGonnagle\" She guiltily looked down at the sherry bottle in her hand\n\n\"Come on. I'll take you up myself\" She said, seeming to rethink her idea. Allen obediently followed her, his body had gone oddly numb and his heart thundered in his ears. He hadn't understood everything she had said but the phrase 'a soul for a soul' seemed clear enough\n\nHad Professor Trewlany just made a real prediction?\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Lavi ran up a steep grassy hill, clutching at a stitch in his side. He had just come off a mission when he received a message via Golem<p>\n\n'_It has begun. Come at once' _\n\nLavi dodged his way around a few towns peole as he zigzagged his way towards the Black Order's building. He knew ever since the Earl appeared to Allen and Himself earlier on in the year that things were starting to pick up but even so, he had really hoped they would have more time than this. Scrambling up the steep hill to the Black Orders doors, Lavi wondered what this would mean for the Order. He really _really _hoped that they had some sort of secret weapon. That was the only reason all that human experimentation had been overlooked- in the vain hopes that somehow it would produce a way for them to win the war, for although Bookmen didn't chose sides in a battle, this particular one was so very different from every other Lavi had observed. If this one was long, there would be no more world to observe. The Bookment had no choice but to pick a side, purely on the fact that they were human, their side was already chosen for them. He finally burst through the door of the hospital wing and saw someone he eventually recognised as General Yeeger slumped in a chair, his body swathed in bandages, eyes rolled back madly in his head\n\n\"The Millennium Count is searching\" He croaked in a twisted version of a lullaby\n\n\"Searching for the precious heart. It wasn't me. Next who'll it be?\" Over and over again he sang this creepy tune, his frozen expression of horror never changing. Lavi shuddered\n\n\"I guess this is it then\" He said grimly\n\n\"Yes\" Komui said, unusually serious\n\n\"The Earl has begun to look for the Heart- the innocence that controls all other pieces of innocence\" He sighed and pushed his glasses up his nose, his tone becoming business like\n\n\"We must find and protect our generals now. I'm afraid we have no other option now. Before, it was not so important but I'm afraid we can no longer be so forgiving\" His eyes fixed on Lavi's seriously\n\n\"We _must _find General Cross\"\n\n\"But we don't have any idea where he could be\" Lavi protested, and uncomfortable feeling growing in his stomach- he was pretty sure he knew where this was heading and sure enough\n\n\"We need his apprentice. Lavi, _I need you to find and capture Allen Walker, whatever the cost!\"_\n\n\n\t42. Chapter 42\n\n**A/N- Shoutouts to people annoyed by my pairings- I'll allow a vote.

I'll see if I can figure something out but no promises :)**\n\n**dcdc123: Today :3**\n\nThe fire in the common room crackled merrily and Allen moved gratefully towards its warmth- he had spent the majority of the night sitting in the nursery, unable to sleep, the run in with Trewlany playing on his mind horribly\n\n_'you will lose the one who is dear to you'_\n\nA shudder ran through his body again and he pulled Mai (whom he had stolen from her room as soon as she woke up) closer to him. He had flown to her room the very second he had gotten away from Trewlany, his heart in his mouth, fully expecting to find an empty bed, perhaps an open window. Now that he had her, he didn't want to let go ever again. Mai seemed unbothered by this attention, merrily playing with all the new toys she had received for Christmas. His friends hadn't noticed anything yet either, all three of them discussing the news that Hagrid was half-giant. Ron was horrified that Harry and Hermione weren't bothered by this news at all and- if Allen hadn't been stressing out so much about the terrifying night he'd had- he probably would have been tempted to smack him around the head again. Mai, it seemed had similar thoughts to Allen though and she threw her new dolly at Ron's head\n\n\"Stop being mean! It's not Hagrid's fault he's all tall! He probably just drank too much milk\" All four of them looked at Mai curiously\n\n\"What!\" She said defensively \"Drinking milk makes you from up big and strong… so… maybe he just drank lots 'n' lots of milk. I don't like milk. That's why I'm still small\" There was a pause as they all took in the little girls logic then- to her immense irritation- they all laughed and Harry ruffled the disgruntled girls hair\n\n\"Please don't ever grow up\" He said fondly\n\n\"Ooh and speaking of growing up, Allen, don't think I didn't notice you trying to downplay your birthday! Here's your present\"\n\nHe chirped, handing over a brightly wrapped parcel- Hermione and Ron handed theirs over too- they had conspired together to wait until boxing day to celebrate as the Yule Ball had been on his birthday and it'd make it much more of a surprise anyway. Allen forgot his melancholy momentarily as he ripped through the pile of presents which grew as Tim and a number of owls delivered a few more from Hagrid, Dumbledore and Mrs Wesley. He gained a personal organiser from Hermione which had- he noted- a special charm that tracked the amount of sleep you got so that it changed colour depending on how well rested you were. It very quickly turned an alarming shade of red and he hurriedly stuffed it under the wrapping paper, but not quickly enough to evade Hermione's sharp eyes and she shot him a disapproving look, thankfully not saying anything. Harry's present consisted mainly of sweet treats from Honeydukes but also a small leather case which expanded out impossibly to reveal a large selection of healing potions. Ron's present contained a packet of deluxe sugar quills. Mrs Weasly provided a gold Weasly jumper with silver 'A' on the chest and a large packet of chocolate and hazelnut muffins which Allen wasted no time in digging into though he was very careful not to get any of the chocolate over the three large books he received from Dumbledore\n\n\"Extreme Incantations, The Dark Arts Arts Outsmarted and The Healer's Helpmate... Guess he had similar thoughts to you Harry\" Allen grinned, just barely restraining himself from delving into them right away\n\n\"Hopefully I won't need to bug Madame Pomfrey as much now\" He joked, deliberately avoiding Hermione's eye again as she frowned at his light-hearted approach to the injuries he tended to receive. He sat the books carefully to one side and opening the smaller package that had been attached to them to reveal a thick leather belt with small black compartments **(1)**, a small note telling him that each had an undetectable expansion charm and featherweight charm on them so he could store as many items as he wished (including food). Allen grinned excitedly and stowed the sweets and leather case Harry had given him in one of the compartments. Harry, Hermione, Ron and Mai had all seized one of Allen's muffins while he was distracted and were all munching away, looking very pleased with themselves for managing to steal food from him (it was no mean feat). Allen scowled playfully at them and grabbed the remaining three muffins and stuffed them all (rather triumphantly) into his mouth, ignoring the noises of disgust that they produced as he munched through them. He finally reached Hagrid's package which was a small brown paper package. Allen gulped down his last mouthful and wiped his hands before prising the spell-o-tape off the package and unfolding it to reveal a pack of hand-made poker cards. A small note was attached\n\n'_I know how much you love to play card games, and I was just thinking, seeing as how you'll be leaving soon and all that you coold use these and then youd remember hogwarts when you played. Hope you have a great birthday. Give hugs and kisses to Mai_\n\n_Hagrid'_\n\nAllen folded the note up carefully and slipped it into one of the compartments on his new belt, his eyes bright. He then flipped his way through the cards, each of which depicted some sort of magical creature instead of the usual aces and spades. There was a Chinese fireball, its ruff fanned out like a crown around its head instead of the 'King' card and a phoenix, its feathers flaming like a cloak around it in place of the 'Queen'. Hagrid's artwork was surprisingly good though, as Harry pointed out, he had depicted the creatures in a typical Hagrid-ish way. The dragon looked as harmless as a puppy- not at all like the one Allen had met on the night of the first Triwizard test but you really could expect nothing less from someone who thought it was a good idea to keep a giant spider as a pet...\n\nThe four teenagers were still admiring the cards as the trudged through the snow-laden grounds on their way to 'Care of Magical Creature'. Allen, excited to see Hagrid and thank him for the gift, ran on ahead of the group but as Harry, Ron and Hermione rounded the corner, they saw him walking back towards them with a confused look on his face\n\n\"He's not there\" He said, his voice worried, joined them\n\n\"What?\" Harry asked stupidly.\n\nAllen shrugged and pointed to a tall woman who was standing in front of Hagrid's hut. The woman, it turned out, was Proffessor Grubbly-Plank and it was about as easy getting information out of her as it was getting blood from a stone. She blatenly ignored their questions and strode ahead of the class, leaving the group to trail behind her, casting curious looks at the dark windows of Hagrid's hut. Allen didn't pay one bit of attention to the beautiful unicorns in the hatch\n\n\"But he gave me my birthday present\" He said for the fifth time \"Why didn't he _say_ he was ill if he was ill\"\n\n\"Oh he's not _Ill _Walker\" came Malfoy's scathing voice\n\n\"No, he is just too humiliated to show his _big _ugly face, if you catch my drift\" He grinned at Crabbe and Goyle who guffawed and grinned conspiratorially\n\n\"What do you mean, Malfoy\" Harry snapped irritably. Malfoy threw a newspaper at them carelessly\n\n\"You really should keep up with the news you know\" He sneered, a look of glee on his face as all four of them bent over the paper to read the article.\n\n\"This\" muttered Allen \"is the biggest pile of _horse manure _ I have ever read. What is this about _him\" _He pointed at Crabbe \"Getting a bite from a flobberworm? They don't even have teeth!\"\n\nCrabbe sniggered, looking rather proud of himself for coming up with such a clever lie\n\n\"Well\" Malfoy said, with mock piety\n\n\"I just thought it was important that everyone know the truth, I mean to say, a _giant _teaching children? It just isn't right. Who's to say he even understands what he is teaching? At any moment, his animalistic side could take over and… well… goodness knows what could happen\" He watched triumphantly at the growing anger on their faces\n\n\"I was just concerned for the well-being of my fellow students\" He simpered but that was enough. Allen snapped. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep, or the pressure of the past few days. Or perhaps it was just the smug look of superiority on Malfoy's face. Whatever the reason, he surged forward, grabbing Malfoy by the front of his robes and slammed him hard against the trunk of a nearby tree. Screams and cried echoed from the class- or at least from the Slytherin side… the Gryfindors were significantly less concerned- Professor Grubbly-Plank yelled over the noise \"_WHAT _do you think you are doing!\" But Allen either didn't hear or didn't care\n\n\"You slimy piece of filth\" He spat\n\n\"Hagrid was accepted to Hogwarts, the finest school in the country so that says all that needs to be said about his mental capacity and as for his _humanity\" _He leaned forward and lowered his voice to a venomous hiss\n\n\"Hagrid has more compassion and kindness in his little finger than you have in your whole body Malfoy. You with your schemes and your poisonous words, out to hurt as many people as possible. Hagrid is twice the man you are\" He let go and backed away, a look of disgust on his face, leaving Malfoy crumpled at the base of the tree looking rather shell-shocked. He gathered his wits though and pointed after Allen \"That was assault! Professor! Walker just attacked me!\"\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank had an unreadable(2) look on her face and she shot a quick look at Allen before saying\n\n\"I didn't see any attack. On your feet Malfoy. And stop interrupting the class\" She turned to Allen\n\n\"Don't make me regret my decision\" She said in an undertone before sweeping back over to the paddock and resuming the lesson. Malfoy sent a venomous look in Allen's direction but seemed unwilling to enter into another confrontation and avoided him for the rest of the lesson. Harry, Ron exchanged surprised looks, both unwillingly impressed by their new teacher but Hermione instead watched Allen who was staring pale faced into the distance, his face blank and his fists clenched. What was going on with him?\n\nLavi jerked awake with a start as the Pada kicked him hard in the ribs\n\n\"Oi, old geezer! What was that for\" He pouted, rubbing his eye sleepily \"I was having the best dream as well… Kanda was getting hit over the head by a giant lollipop wielding a rubber chicken and Lenanlee was wearing this cute little…\" He got no further because Bookman dropkicked him in the face, sending him flying across the room\n\n\"Enough of your babble you incessant little pest! You're supposed to be working at bringing Allen to the order! Instead here you are! Sleeping like a good for nothing lazy child!\"\n\nLavi raised himself with a groan \"Well thats a little strong\" He muttered grumpily \"It's not so easy getting a hold of him you know! His golem is untraceable and he's not answering our messages…\" The look on Bookman's face became positively apocalyptic- no one but Lavi would have been able to tell as his facial expression itself hardly changed but that twitch of the eyebrow… that darkening of the aura… it was unmistakable. Lavi kept to his feet \"But of course I wouldn't give up so easily!\" He gasped \"I'm off right not to try and figure out a way to get him! Just you wait! I'll get him!\" And with that, he turned tail and ran out of the room. It wasn't retreating he consoled himself, it was just advancing in a backwards direction. He hurried down the corridor, paying no attention to where he was going at all. How to get a hold of Allen without him realising. It wouldn't be easy, that was for sure. He still had no idea how he had gotten away from them all the other times they had captured him- even with that collar specially designed by the science department- Lavi still cringed with the memory of what had happened there- he'd never get over the humiliation he had felt as he turned up to the order… the collar joining him and Kanda together. Whatever that kid had done to it, it had stopped obeying his orders and it had take a full _day _for Komui to figure out how to remove it. And that wasn't accounting for the day of travel attached to Kanda by a short length of chain. Exactly how he had survived, he still couldn't remember. If it was a case of just capturing Allen, it would be easier but they needed his co-operation as well and he seemed pretty set on not joining the Order and his ability to disappear into thin air was unprecedented. The best option he could come up with (and it was painful to think that it was his best option) was simply to reason with him but if he couldn't get in contact with him, how was he to go all logic on him? Stoopid Panda. Stoopid order. Stoopid _Lvierre. _Did they think it was so easy to contact him? Lavi pouted moodily and stuck his hands in his pockets. All the times he had run into him previously, it had been on a mission of some sort or other but as their only mission to the moment was tracking down Cross, it seemed less likely that they would meet him purely by chance. At the moment, they were just following rumours and stories of Cross's presence- it was all they had to go on and even though they had two bookmen on their side, the best leads they could come up with were pretty weak. They _needed _Allen. Komui had mentioned something about Allen's golem begin able to track down its maker which seemed a weird technical fluke in Lavi's opinion- from a guy who didn't want to be tracked down, seemed like a pretty stupid thing to attach to his devices though, he guessed that since they didn't have Allen, they didn't have the fluke and so it wasn't such a flaw. He smirked, Cross seemed like a pretty interesting guy… he was looking forward to meeting him\n\nSkin scowled in anger and irritation as he bulldozed his ways through a snow-smothered forest in Albania. Lero floated behind him, keeping a safe distance from the bad-tempered Noah as they made their way to a seemingly abandoned house in the middle of this god-forsaken woodland. Skin was beyond livid- they were here on the slimmest of clues as to that stinking snake-like freaks whereabouts. It was utterly ridiculous and just went to prove how desperate they were for some sort of lead. The Earl for some reason thought that freak was still breathing and was determined to search him out. He was getting paranoid all of a sudden, now that his plan was beginning to come into effect. He was getting his trusted Noah back and his army of Akuma had been built up to an unimaginable horde. Not to mention the fact that the idiot Lvierre had begun making Akuma-cross bread freaks and placed them to work in the order. The fool of a man- so arrogant- to think that he even had the hope of controlling a creation that completely belonged to the one true ruler of the closer the Earl got his goal however, the more paranoid he became and the Voldey freak was worrying him and when the Earl was worried…\n\nWell…\n\nSkin shivered slightly and continued forging a thick path through the deep snow. Stupid Tiki he thought- if that idiot wasn't so damn lazy and difficult to get a hold of, he would be doing this in his place. Road of course whined too much to be sent on a mission like this, the twins couldn't be trusted with anything and Lulabell was already off on some other mission or other. His other brothers and sisters were still in the process of waking up. Although the transfer of souls had gone well, they were in something of a comatose state however the Earl was confident that he would be able to wake them. Until he did though, Skin had to deal with the grunt work.\n\nExactly what had made the Earl so sure Voldey-thing had been in Albania of all places was beyond Skin- sure there had been some speak of a few foragers seeing smoke from the cottage and a couple of idiotic teens had been found dead in the woods with bloody punter marks in their necks that had been put down to some sort of wild animal attack. That and the fact that an odd woman had turned up in the village for a few days before mysteriously disappearing was enough to send off alarm bells with the Earl apparently and now he had Skin out to scout the abandoned house.\n\nSkin gave a grunt of relief as he finally reached the crumbling stone building\n\n\"Lets get this over with\" He grunted to Lero\n\n\"Lero I'm not going in first Lero!\" Lero squealed panickedly, sweating profusely and flinching away from the poisonous glare that Skin shot at him\n\n\"Fine. You useless coward\" Skin spat, kicking the door in violently and striding into the room, lightning crackling at his finger tips, little bolts skittering into the corners of the room before fizzling out as they found nothing but cold stone\n\n\"Get in\" He growled to the ridiculous golem \"Looks like someone has been here. Gone a few months by the look of things. Take your readings and lets get out of here\"\n\nThe Earl sat forward in his chair, leering at the screen as Lero's scans flashed. Yes, someone had definitely been there and had cast some pretty powerful spells- the fact that the scans were still picking up the energy after so long was proof of that… He cursed under his breath irritably. From the looks of things, that cursed wizard was still alive. The arms of the chair buckled under his grip, the manic grin never wavering. What was it going to take to get rid of that pest? It was near impossible to get any information on those wizarding freaks even with the equipment that the 14th had made… the 14th…\n\nThe Earls grip loosened slightly- he missed him more now than ever- he had always been so good at this stuff. It was his design that allowed them to scan for magical energy and he had a deep understanding of the working s of magic. Mostly due to his brother Mana… how the Earl wished he had gotten rid of that pest as he was sure it had been his fault Nea had turned on them. He had always kept that human side of Nea present, even if it was just a small flicker and the longer he stayed with him, the more his human side came through. At first, the Earl hadn't minded- Nea had been so destructive which, while useful had not been as useful as his more scientific side. With his melodies, he could both tear apart and build up. Initially, when the Noah in him had awoken, Nea had been overwhelmed. His power had been phenomenal but he was reckless and mindless. Mana however had stuck with his brother, using his magic to protect himself from his rage. He had stayed throughout his transformation and throughout his time in the family. The Earl had been tempted to dispatch of him immediately of course but when he saw the control he held over Nea and his magic, he decided to wait. The world would never truly be his until his Akuma were the only creation in it, and the Wizards with their magic were just as much of a threat as the exorcists. Everything had been going so well, till out of the blue, Nea turned on them and almost killed off the whole family. A single tear slid down the Earls face. That pain he had felt as he looked over his slaughtered children and looked up at the one whom he had loved so dearly, blood still dripping from his sword\n\n\"_I see now, Adam\" _he had said, his voice sorrowful _\"I see the melodies of the world and I will not let you crush them. I will stop you\" _\n\nIt must have been that cursed brother- putting ideas in his head- perhaps even using that accursed magic of his. As if one of his creations would ever even consider living in a world still populated by God's abominable creatures. What a twisted pace- people with free will, with all those weaknesses. Those mortal beings, with twisted morals and insatiable greed. The world he wished to build should be everyones dream. He would build it on the bones of the debased creatures they called humans- wizard and mundane alike and no one, not even Tom Riddle would stop him\n\nAllen sat in the darkened nursery, watching Mai's breathing, unable to tear his eyes away.\n\n\"You will lose the one who is dear to you…\" The words echoed round and round his head, like a mantra. He jumped violently as the door creaked open and Hermione slipped in and sat down next to him. He avoided her eyes, which were practically brimming over with concern. She reached out her had and touched his shoulder gently\n\n\"Allen…\" He hugged his knees closer to his body and, in a rather small voice, told her what Trewlany had told him. There was a long shocked silence and Allen stubbornly refused to make eye contact with her.\n\n\"Allen\" She said gently again \"You do realise don't you that prophesies are… well… unreliable to say the least. There's no reason to think that anything is going to happen to Mai- She's in Hogwarts! The safest place in the world. You really have nothing to worry about. Besides, Trewlany is full of rubbish, you know that!\"\n\nAllen however was unconvinced\n\n\"You have seen what goes on in this school Hermione, pretty sure its not the safest place in the world. And you _know _Trewlany prophesied that Wormtail would return to Voldemort\" Hermione let out a small squeak at this and Allen shot her an exasperated glance \"You-know-who then. It was a true prophesy. There is no doubt about that. I just… Its just… I've been so selfish with Mai- I knew when I took her that I was going to be putting her in danger but I took her anyway. If anything ever happens to her, I'll never forgive myself. She doesn't deserve any of this\" He yelped suddenly as Hermione slapped him non to gently around the head\n\n\"What was that for\" He hissed, worriedly watching Mai for any signs of her stirring\n\n\"You!\" Hermione hissed, venomously \"You are the most idiotic, dimwitted, fool of a boy I have ever met!\" Her face was bright red and she was shaking with anger. Allen backed off slightly but she grabbed a handful of his robes and bundled him out of the nursery into the corridor where she let lose\n\n\"You are NOT allowed to blame yourself for this do you hear me?\" She yelled \"Tell me, did YOU make Akuma?\"\n\nAllen shook his head rather nervously \"No, but\"\n\n\"Did YOU kick her out of her parents house?\" Hermione steamrollered on, ignoring him\n\n\"No\" He conceded \"but…\"\n\n\"Did YOU at any point put her deliberately in danger?\" She continued, her eyes spitting\n\n\"Of course not!\" Allen protested indignantly\n\n\"Well then!\" She said triumphantly \"Any one with brains can see that you love her and have been protecting her through her entire life and I would like to point out that you have not had the same courtesy, yet do I hear you complaining? NO! Well then, what do we conclude from this?\" She glared pointedly at Allen who shook his head looking non-plussed. Hermione drew herself up to her full height, her bushy hair seeming to expand in her fury and add another few inches onto her height\n\n\"We are to conclude that if anything ever _did _happen to Mai, it would NOT be your fault! Besides all this, I'd like to just point out here that the prophesy doesn't exactly mention her by name, or even say she will be harmed. You're not the only one who cares for her Allen, she is surrounded by a school of wizards all of whom would rather die than let her get hurt\" She seemed to deflate after this tirade and she lent forward and hugged a rather shellshocked Allen\n\n\"You go through life on your own\" She said, her voice sounding rather chocked with tears\n\n\"You deal with everything on your own and put your life on the line time and time again with no regard for those who care for you. Just think Allen, how worried and sad you feel at the thought of Mai being hurt- that is how we feel about you, every time you disappear off in the middle of the night to fight these monsters\" She gripped the back of his robes tightly\n\n\"I ...\" Allen said surprised at this outburst, not entirely sure how to respond\n\n\"Shut up\" She sobbed\n\n\"That prophesy said you will die and yet you didn't even think of that did you? You didn't even think how it would hurt when you told me? Do you hold that little regard for our friendship that you think your life is so inconsequential to me?\" Allen's eyes widened slightly. He _hadn't _really thought of it- sure he had realised the prophesy was about his death but…\n\n\"I'm sorry\" He whispered hugging Hermione back. I just… I didn't think\" Hermione pulled back and wiped at her eyes, glaring at him through her tears\n\n\"Don't think I'm going to forgive you so easily\" She choked, but she gave him a small smile.\n\n\"Come on, we need to tell Ron and Harry\" They both made their way up to the common room where even Ron set aside his differences to tell Allen that he was being paranoid and that if anyone even came close to Mai or him they would _quote unquote _\n\n_\"_Pwn him like a boss\" which, although it didn't make the situation any less serious, it made him feel better\n\nAllen was in the middle of breakfast with Luna (he now rotated meals between the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tables) when a first year kid ran up to him with a letter clutched in their pudgy fist. The kid practically threw it at him, garbling something that sounded life \"Profsrdmbdrsdtogvthstou\" Before he ran away, shooting fearful looks over his shoulder. Allen raised an eyebrow in the kids direction and cracked the seal. Luna lent curiously over to read it with him\n\n\"_To Allen_\n\n_Please come to my office during break, have some rather important news_\n\n_Sincerely Professor Dumbledore_\n\n_P.S., password is Sugar Snaps\"_\n\nLuna fixed her wide eyes on him \"Do you suppose he found out about the manticore in the Forbidden Forest?\" Allen gave him a rather non-plussed look\n\nDidn't you know, Hagrid was using one to breed with fire-crabs to make those blast-end screwt things- I heard their venom does some pretty cool stuff. If he does tell you something about it, do you think you could convince him to let us take a sample? They're really rare…\" Allen nodded, deciding not to even question the theory. First period Transfiguration seemed to drag on forever and it took Allen about half the class to turn the guinie pig into a pair of mittens, and even then, they still squirmed uncomfortably every time you tried to pull them on. As soon as the bell rang, Allen made his way up to Dumbledore's office, waiting till the corridor was free of students before opening up the passageway. He knocked politely and entered at Dumbledores command, he was slightly taken aback at the piles of paper that were stacked around the room- even though they were neatly ordered, he had never seen Dumbledore's office in such a mess\n\n\"Ah, Allen, its good to see you. I've had a message from Cross… It looks like the Earl's plans are escalating. There's no time to wait for the ministry to come to their senses any more, we need to take matters into our own hands\" He waved his wand at the scrolls spread across the desk and they all organised themselves into a nice bundle, held together with a ribbon\n\n\"How exactly are we going to do that?\" Allen asked\n\n\"Do we get to turn them into gerbils and run the government ourselves?\" He grinned excitedly and Dumbledore chuckled\n\n\"If only… I was thinking a little less anarchy and a little more intellectual rationalising?\" Allen sighed disappointedly \"I'll take what I can get. What are these then\" He asked tapping the scrolls\n\n\"Accounts of Akuma attacks I have gathered- interviews, pictures and the like. All that needs done is to get an interviewer- It'd be best coming from you, this is your story. Plus you seem to have a knack with interviewers\" He smirked slightly, eyes twinkling merrily. Allen rolled his eyes and gathered the scrolls up\n\n\"Oh, I'll get these published. I have _connections\" _He wiggled his eyebrows impressively and backed out of the room, using his elbow to open the door.\n\nHarry manoeuvred his way with considerable difficulty through the towers of books and parchment that surrounded Allen and Luna. They appeared to be working simultaneously on a potions essay, a transfiguration diagram, books on rare magical creatures and the article Luna was helping Allen publish about Akuma.\n\n\"This\" He announced impressively, plonking down on the table in front of him\n\n\"Is an intervention\"\n\nAllen stared at him in confusion.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Im interviening!\" Harry said again \"I'm intervening so you can help us in an intervention- I'm doing an intervention within an intervention. Its, like, intervention-ception\"\n\n\"Woah man\" Ron chipped in \"Thats deep\"\n\n'I know, right\" Harry countered. Allen snapped his fingers irritably under his nose\n\n\"Why are you sitting on my potions essay, Potter. Focus!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah… about that. Well, you need to get you're but out of this cave of books you have built and Hagrid needs to get out of his cabin so _you _need to get out of here so we can get _Hagrid _out of there. Do you follow? Oh, and bring Mai, we are not- it turns out- so honourable that we won't resort to simple emotional blackmail when needed\" Allen opened his mouth to protest but both Harry and Ron reached down, taking an arm each and frog-marched him out of the Library with Luna calling out \"Good luck!\" After them.\n\nA few minutes later, they deposited a rather disgruntled Allen and an excitable Mai outside the cabin door where Hermione was already banging loudly on the door.\n\n\"No luck\" She sighed, walking over to them. \"Oh good, you brought reinforcements\" Allen handed Mai over to Hermione and approached the hut door\n\n\"Hagrid\" He yelled \"Are you in there?\"\n\n\"Go 'way\" Came a muffled voice from within the cabin.\n\n\"Oh come on!\" he yelled \"You know we don't care about who your parents happen to be. Just let us in ok? We miss you\" There was no reply. Allen made his way over to the rest of them\n\n\"There's no other way\" He said heavily \"We'll have to break out the big guns\" he held out his arms to accept Mai and kissed her on the cheek\n\n\"Go my pretty, work your magic!\" He carried her over to the door\n\n\"Hey Mai, why don't you see if you can get Hagrid to come play with you? He's a little deaf\" He stage whispered \"So you'll have to be extra-specially loud. Do you think you can do that for me?\"\n\nMai nodded excitedly and slapped the flat of her hand on the door, which, while ineffective was undeniably adorable\n\n\"Hagrid!\" She yelled out \"Hagrid, come play! I learnded how to do snap yesterday and Jibo always wins when I play with him. Pleeeeease\" Her incessant pleading went on for about 2 minutes before Hagrid caved and opened the door. Mai flew into his arms instantly and chattered away at breakneck speed about her week in school, oblivious to the strong smell of drink and the tear traks on his cheeks. Feeling incredibly guilty, the rest of them made their way into the cabin too. Allen convinced Mai to play another game of snap, though with all the best will in the world, he couldn't quite control his alter-ego\n\n\"Jibo! That's not faiiir!\" Mai wailed as Allen won for the forth time in a row. He chuckled and handed the pack over to Ron\n\n\"Take my place man\" He said, dropping a kiss onto the top of Mai's head \"I sense a temper tantrum coming on!\" He swapped places with him and joined in with Harry and Hermione's intervention\n\n\"Look Hagrid\" He said patiently \"Rita writes rubbish- do you believe one word of what she wrote about me?\" Hagrid shoot his head miserably \"Well then, none of us believe you're about to eat half the student population in a blood rage either\" Hagrid let out a weak chuckle at this and Allen took that as a good sign\n\n\"Come on. You know we rely on your expertise to stop those blasted skrewts from setting fire to the whole school and there is no way Harry can win the task without you on the sidelines. Please come back?\" Between that and the hugs and kisses he received from Mai, they left the a significantly cheerier Hagrid behind them\n\n\"I know you'll win this thing!\" Hagrin yelled after Harry \"You show 'em. Beat 'em all\" and Allen couldn't help but notice the look of concern on Harry's face- was it possible that his friend wasn't as prepared for the next task as he was claiming to be?\n\n…\n\n\"YOU IDIOT!\" Allen yelled in exasperation \"There's only a few weeks left! How can you _possibly _not have told us you didn't know yet?! We could have been helping you!\" Harry shook his head miserably\n\n\"I'm sorry, its just there is all this pressure and you are, like, barely sleeping as it is… Cedric gave me a clue though. Wasn't going to go through with it. He's probably just screwing with me but… I guess I should try it out?\" He gave a rather sheepish smile and ducked quickly as Allen threw a book at his head\n\n\"What are you still doing here? Get a move on!\" He ran from the room avoiding another missile and Allen growled irritably. Fool of a boy. Now he had to add that to the ever-growing list of things to worry about.\n\nAllen and Luna sat back to back in the library, among a sea of parchment and books. Allen was alternating between writing his potions essay, searching for viable ways to breathe underwater and talking through his first of what was going to be a series of interviews in 'The Quibbler\" on Akuma. Luna was sifting through the scrolls of parchment Dumbledore had provided with statements from muggles who had seen Akuma and lived to tell the tale\n\n\"Ok, we'll start off with the eye-witness accounts before we do your story- although people tend to be sceptical of muggle eye-witnesses...\" She said, shuffling some bits of paper around\n\n\"That way, there'll be some hard evidence for people to get them hooked, then we'll move onto your own experiences\" She pulled a few of the photos to the front\n\n\"These'll be perfect\" There was silence \"Hey, Allen, are you ok?\" A soft snore came from behind her. She smiled and turned slightly, easing Allen's head down onto her lap and reaching across to pick up his potions essay. A few hours later, she had finished a draft of the article, his potions essay and was digging through a couple dusty books on magical creatures when she let out a cry of excitement. Allen woke with a jerk\n\n\"Whuzzgoingon?\" He gasped\n\n\"Look at this!\" Luna cried excitedly, leaning closely in to read the faded, small print\n\n_\"… for as many creatures as we have discovered, there are many we have yet to research. For example, the Akuma- a creature said to kill humans and wear their skins as their own. Though some skepticism still remains about this creatures existence, below we have listed a number of suspicious deaths that have been linked to this creature, along with eye witness accounts\"_\n\nShe turned her pale eyes onto Allen\n\n\"These accounts are from wizarding families Allen! And well known ones at that!\" Allen lent over to read the passage too, a wide grin spreading across his face\n\n\"You are a genius Luna\" He enthused \"This is brilliant!\"\n\nShe grinned at his excitement \"We can definitely put this in the article- It might be the final piece of proof we need\"\n\nAllen lent across the tombe and embraced her\n\n\"Seriously, thank you so much for all you've done for me\" He pulled away and gently kissed her.\n\n\"You are a life saver!\" They grinned awkwardly at each other and began to gather up the papers spread around them after a sharp word from madame Pince.\n\nI was odd though Allen realised as he walked up to the common room. Clearly the Akuma _used _to kill wizards at least- what had changed? There was no way that statistically they had just been lucky in the past 40 odd years. Not one single wizard had been attacked, meaning there was not one single 'reliable' eye witness account and therefore the wizarding world would be unwilling to accept the existence of the Akuma- Muggle accounts and deaths apparently just didn't hold as much sway. Perhaps the Earl was actually just hoping by avoiding attacking wizards, he would be able to avoid any attack from them. To his credit, this plan seemed to be working out for him so far but Allen couldn't help but feel that it just wasn't his style...\n\n(1) the belt from his black order uniform basically\n\n(2) I think grubbly-plank is underestimated a lot- remember she would have taught Hagrid in school and I think that she'd have liked him and so would be loyal...just my opinion :)\n\n\n\t43. Chapter 43\n\n**A/N: I am so sorry for how late this is- In my defence, uni is piling the work on and this was a really hard chapter to write- not that I wasn't really excited about it or anything, its just very plot-developing and I needed to juggle timelines a bit and figure out technicalities and stuff and this so sorry and here you go and I really, really hope you don't hate it ^^ Ooh! I have some Kanda/Allen bonding time in here :D Its not Yullen or anything but its just developing their relationship into more of a camaraderie tolerance to full blown dislike :P PS., I concluded after the pairing poll that no matter what I do, I will annoy ppl so I am sticking with my previous pairing plan! Screw all of you! notreallypleasedonthatemeimsorry '('.')'**\n\n**Will of the Abyss: I am sorry I haven't had time to formulate a coherent and semi-intellectual response to your PM yet but I am LOVING these ideas! You're welcome for the crying Hermione- I pretty much just gave her Lenalee's rant and changed it a little to be more Hermione-ish but yeah, totally incorperating our ideas into this story :D :D :D **\n\n**fairygirl90- You pose a very good point about white Tyki and I hadn't thought about that- I will definitely arrange a meeting yes, it is important for plots and stuffs. Will have to come up with another way to do that- thanks so much for pointing that out! I would have forgotten otherwise! Yeah, I really love Luna as a character so I wanted to bring her in before Allen leaves for the Order :) I quite like them together too because she is so accepting and Allen has always felt like an outcast- they just seem like a good fit :P Hope your laptop remains intact after this chappy- tis a rather long one! I'm pretty impressed at you reading the whole thing in one day! This story is turning out much longer than I expected. I'm really glad you enjoyed it so much- thanks :)**\n\n**dcdc123 and Shirubagure- They are just adorkable aren't they ^^**\n\n**Dominus Cordis- Yeah, I guess your right, I just had so many requests for specific pairings and I didn't want to disappoint my readers if the majority really wanted one outcome but Im going for my original plan anyway- just as a warning, it may be some time before this story is actually done- just sayin' been writing this for... omg, like, 2 years! Wow 0.0 I really need to get my act together don't I?**\n\n**Cana99: ... sorry? There is cute AllenxKanda-ness in this chapter if that helps? I do like yullen too but this story is just writing itself as a laven in my head and I seem to have very little control over my own brain :/ :P**\n\n**Rex888: after babysitting a number of times for my little brother and sisters, I will ****_never_**** underestimate the abilities of small children *shivers***\n\n**PoisonousDeamon: Ew! How could you suggest besmirching Allen's purity like that! No! This will start as Allenxluna then go on to laven so you'll get the best of both worlds :)**\n\n**cororandomontes: I kind of wanted to do an Allen Rita Skeeter show down but I couldnt find the time in the story or in my life to write it :P**\n\nHarry passed the letter he had received from Sirius around his friends\n\n\"He hasn't come back to Hogsmede?\" Ron asked incredulously\n\n\"Looks like it, doesn't it?\" said Hermione, taking the letter from him\n\n\"Maybe he has some information for us\" Allen said hopefully \"He might have figured out who put your name in that goblet! Even if he hasn't, it'll be good to see him again, right Harry?\"\n\nHarry nodded, his pleasure palpable and his good mood continued right through the day till the final class- potions. Malfoy and his group of faithful followers stood snickering at the door.\n\n\"Ooh, here they are\" Pansy sneered as they approached, giving Hermione a dirty look. The teens glanced at each other, unintimidated\n\n\"What's your problem?\" Ron snapped at her irritably\n\n\"What, grumpy coz your the only one she's not put out for yet Ronny-kins?\" Pansy sneered, sending another poisonous look in Hermione's direction. Allen wasn't entirely sure what she was implying but whatever it was, it definitely wasn't nice.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but could you please tell us what are you talking about\" He said, keeping his tone even. Pansy snorted and threw the magazine she was holding at them calling out\n\n\"Don't know why you even need to ask _Allen, _no point in trying to hide it anymore. Your secret is out- _I _was under the impression that you were dating that freaky bug-eyed chick. Can't say I really approve of your taste in women, though I guess you can't be too picky looking like that…\" Her eyes trailed scathingly down Allen's body and she wrinkled her nose in revulsion- Malfoy sniggered in the background\n\nShooting a rather confused look at Pansy, Allen reached for the magazine but at that moment, Snape arrived and opened the classroom door. They filed in obediently and waited impatiently for Snape to turn his back. At the first chance, Hermione rifled through the magazine and Allen lent over her shoulder to read along with her. It was one of the most spiteful articles he had ever read- even by Rita Skeeter's usual standards, basically implying that Hermione was trying to seduce Harry, Allen and Krum with the assistance of a love potion. Alongside the article, there was a picture from the Yule Ball of Allen placing his jacket around Hermione's shoulder. Allen maintained his poker face with some difficulty, fighting hard to quell the urge to beat Rita Skeeter about the face with his codfish. Hermione just laughed off the article but he couldn't help but feel anger for her- it was just childish that a grown woman felt the need to write such cruel things about a teenage girl who was as far from the flirtatious tease she was being painted as, as was possible\n\n\"I wonder how she knew Victor asked me to visit him over the summer though\" Hermione asked, avoided the inquisitive stares of her friends as she ground up her potions ingredients.\n\n\"He asked you to come visit him? What did you say?\" Ron asked, sounding distinctly put-out\n\n\"Well, I was too busy seeing you and Harry were OK to answer him at that precise moment…\" she trailed off, pointedly ignoring Ron's incredulous look \"By the way Allen, you really should go see Luna about this- set her strait before she gets the wrong idea\" At this point, Snape swooped in like a vindictive bat and proceeded to read the entire article out loud to the whole class, very effectively humiliating all of them. Allen escaped from the class as soon as possible but he had no way to get in to the Ravenclaw common room so eventually he had to give up and wait till the next morning.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>He sat at the Gryffindor table, nervously glancing up every time students came through the door till eventually Luna wondered in, looking rather like she had ended up there completely by accident. Allen waited for her to sit down and nervously watched, trying to figure out when would be the best time to approach her. Hermione shot him a fierce look from the other side of the table that clearly said 'you-had-better-not-chicken-out-of-this' and he quickly stood up, and walked over to the Ravenclaw table, swallowing his trepidation. He approached Luna, trying to ignore the glares and giggles from the girls at the table. He sat down on one of the empty seats surrounding her. She seemed not to notice his presence till he tapped her shoulder<p>\n\n\"Oh, hey\" She said, smiling up at him\n\n\"Hey… err… look, Luna, there was this article… I was wondering if maybe you had read it…\"\n\n\"Oh, yes that. Of course I've read it Allen\" Her face was unreadable\n\n\"Err… I hope you know, I mean, I hope you don't believe it\" He stuttered nervously once again cursing his stupid brain for being unable to form coherent sentences when he was around her\n\nHer face was unnaturally serious \"Of course I believe it Allen, how couldn't I? There was a picture. How can you deny it when there is such proof?\"\n\n\"Its not what it looks like, I promise! I was just comforting her, she was really upset and it was cold, I promise we are nothing more than friends- look, I care about you, I'm dating you. I promise, I would never do anything like that to you\" Luna stared at him, her expression still unreadable\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" She asked, sounding rather confused. She held up a copy of 'The Quibbler' which featured a picture of the 'Ashwinder Snake'\n\n\"Do you have a pet Ashwinder?\" She asked hopefully \"That's rather dangerous you know, they do have rather short tempers but they are incredibly rare, you know people don't believe they exist- father and I of course have known of their existance for a while, we did an article on it a few months ago and there have been so many eyewitness accounts but still, people refused to believe that they exist but now there is an actual photo\" she waved The Quibbler in Allen's face, the front of which was sporting a blurry black and white photo, which- though it was moving- was so out of focus as to make it impossible to determine what the picture was actually of\n\n\"What? No! I meant the article in that witch's magazine thing-y about me and Hermione. Here look\" He handed the magazine over to her\n\n\"But I promise it doesn't mean anything\" Luna's wide eyes skimmed the article and she began laughing. Allen nervously smiled too\n\n\"Skeeter really is a very strange writer\" She said folding up the magazine\n\n\"She doesn't like father and I because we publish articles on creatures that she doesn't believe in but she makes stuff up all the time- for some reason people still believe her lies quicker than anything we write\" Allen let out a sigh of relief\n\n\"So you believe me?\" he asked\n\n\"Well, of course\" She said, as if he was rather stupid \"I know you and you are nothing like the person in the article. So, can I see the Ashwinder Snake? Father says here that if you listen hard enough to them, they will tell you a secret spell to create wings of fire. Wouldn't you like wings of fire? I think…\" But Allen cut off her rambling with a kiss on the cheek\n\n\"You\" He laughed \"Are one of a kind\"\n\nLuna looked rather taken aback but smiled and kissed him back, then rested her head on his shoulder\n\n\"Thank you\" She said in a rather small voice. He squeezed her shoulder\n\n\"Wings of fire would be pretty awesome\" He said \"Never would need a broom to get anywhere, plus if I was having an argument with someone, I could just be like _bam! _Wings of Fire. Whutchoo gunna do about it. You can't argue with wings of fire, Luna. It just can't be done...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen had never been so grateful for the Tournament as he was in that semester- the lack of exams was taking a great deal of pressure off him, though the tournament, to be fair, was making up for it- He, Ron and Hermione were spending most of their spare time helping Harry to train for the next task- whatever it was. Allen of course found this rather beneficial as the spells were just as useful for him, but between that, his articles for 'The Quibbler', helping Hermione with SPEW (then sneaking around behind her back to remove the hidden clothes from the unsuspecting house elves) and her Rita-hunting plus his nightly escapades he had very little time to himself. The Order appeared to have disapeared off the face of the earth- probably due to the fact that the Earl was now hunting down their generals however this was causing some issues as the numbers of Akuma were increasing rather rapidly and now there were fewer exorcists so the responsibility fell to him. His Christmas present from Hermione seemed to be permanently wavering between orange and red, resulting in periodic lectures from her about the importance of sleep till eventually he snapped and pointed out to her that in her third year, she had been just as reckless, using the timeturner to attend every class on the timetable after which she- rather sheepishly- fell silent.<p>\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Miles away, Tiedoll wondered dreamily through the sleepy town of 'Little Hangleton' noting down as he went scenes he would like to paint. He was taking a break from innocenc- hunting to investigate the had started to move and he was beginning to get a little nervous. His friend and colleague General Yeeger and been attacked and now that the Noah family was starting to reappear, it seemed that their reprieve was over and the true battle was beginning. With that in mind, Tiedoll had begun to follow any mentions he had heard of the Noah family. Only a few weeks back, there had been reports to the police of a suspicious character in the town, fitting the description of a Noah who had displayed some interest in an old deserted house just outside of the village. Tiedoll wondered as he made his way through the streets how his adorable little students were doing. They were probably rather irritated that he was dodging them but he really <em>really <em>didn't want to go back to the order. Their whole philosophy just rankled him and though he knew he couldn't cut off all ties, he certainly could avoid contact where possible. It was doubtless that they were sending adorable little Yuu and Marie and Daishya after him at this very moment in time however, he had more important things to worry about. Like what the Noah could possibly be interested in in this small, sleepy English village. There was certainly no sign innocence that he could see and there seemed very little else of interest. Come to think of it, many of the places they had been spotted recently seemed to have nothing to do with innocence- just a few months back he was pretty sure the one they called 'Skin Bolic' had been spotted in Albania. Exactly what it was the Noah were up to, he really didn't know. It almost made him wish he had Cross with him. That man may be a sorry excuse for a human being however, he did have a brain in his head and he was much better at following the twisted thinking of their enemies than Tiedoll was. He sighed and scratched his head, he guessed he may as well investigate the house himself- there were murmurs of it being haunted. Perhaps innocence was involved after all however as he made his way to the house, the sky began to darken. An eery silence fell over the countryside and the temperature seemed to drop by a few degrees. Shivering slightly, Tiedoll pulled his coat closer around him and ducked his head against the driving wind. A storm must be coming he thought sadly to himself- he wouldn't get a chance to paint after all and he trudged on to the mansion on top of the hill, not thinking to look back at the sky which was rapidly darkening- not as a result from gathering clouds, but rather streams of Akuma, their bloated bodies blocking out the sun and plunging the surroundings into darkness.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen leant over and placed another slip of parchment to a pile under the heading 'Igor Karkaroff'. With the third task approaching so quickly, he was feeling more and more concerned about Harry's safety. The Triwizard task once again was surrounded by a cloud of mystery but he just had a gut feeling that something was going to happen- this was the last remaining opportunity whoever had put Harry's name in the cup had to do whatever it was they had planned. After hearing what Sirius had told them about Igor's history, he had gone on an espionage mission. Being the adopted child of Dumbledore did have some perks, he had crept up to the Headmaster's office the previous night and 'accidentally' made some copies of files he had 'stumbled upon'. He now knew all about Igor's past as a Death Eater and after adding the information to his file, he folded it up and put it away. Igor was a coward and there was no chance that he would risk so much to get back in with the Death Eaters. For one thing, he was as terrified as everyone else seemed to be of Dumbledore and for another, it was incredibly unlikely that he would ever be accepted into the fold again even if he did bring them Harry Potter. He had ratted too many of them out and besides, there was no real reason that he should suddenly turn back to his old ways, especially considering the cushy life he had now. Madame Maxime was a dead end too- no known affiliation to any Dark Art groups. He'd had a quick glance through the student files too but so far there had only been petty crimes and the usual teen blow-outs. Mostly from the Durmstrang group but so far there was nothing serious enough to cause concern. He had a file open on Barty Crouch too however it was just as confusing- the man followed rules religiously and he hadn't even bent his morals for his family so it made no sense that he was involved with the case however Harry had been certain that he had seen Crouch's name on the Maurader's map and the man was undoubtedly acting very strangely. It was the only file Allen had left and the man certainly would have all the opportunity he needed to enter Harry in for the Tournement but motive…<p>\n\nWhat could possibly have made someone so obsessed with following every letter of the law turn so drastically? and what could explain the complete change in personality… work ethic… and that weird incident with Harry in the forbidden forest…\n\nHe sat for a long time, flicking back through the files he had already looked at, through some of the other suspicious Ministry officials linked with the Tournament but none of them seemed to fit. He sighed in frustration and began to clear everything up when a thought came to him.\n\nHis very first lesson with Mad-Eye Moody...\n\nA spell, that could completely control someone, force them to obey your every command, it would certainly explain Mr. Crouch's complete 180. It would even explain his strange behaviour concerning Harry- perhaps he had momentarily broken it. Though that just raised the concerns even higher around Mr. Crouch's disappearance. If he had broken the imperius spell, perhaps whoever had cast it decided to get rid of him in case it happened again. Unfortunately though that just expanded the field of suspects exponentially- enchanting Mr Crouch would give the access needed to the Goblet of Fire meaning anyone could be behind it.\n\nHe gathered all the papers up and stuffed them in his bag deciding to call it a day, settling back a bit further into the armchair, he curled his legs in underneath himself and pulled out one of the old books on magical creatures he had borrowed from the library. Settling down he began to flick through the pages lazily, letting the crackling fire lull him into a sleepy stupor. The book was focussed on the process of classification of dangerous magical creatures and had some pretty gruesome tales of ministry officials being mauled or otherwise disembowelled by all sorts of creepy creatures. His attention was caught by a small excerpt at the bottom of one of the pages\n\n\"_Alastor Moody, Harold Swinning and Beatrice Newton were sent to investigate strange incidents in the southern region of England where the Elphick family mysteriously disappeared, the third in a series of disappearances over a period of 3 years that included both the Fancourt and Sakndenberg family. A number of possibilities were considered, however the investigation was inconclusive\"_\n\nAllen sat up suddenly, and scrambled through his bag, searching for.. yes! The Fancourt's… the Sakndenberg's and the Elphic's… those were among the families mentioned in the story that Luna had found whose disappearances had been linked to Akuma attacks. He wondered why Moody had never mentioned it before- that would definitely help with his article, a Teacher's and an Auror's opinion would be much more convincing than the word of a student. He was half-way out of his seat to go find Dumbledore when he noticed the time on the clock resting above the fireplace- 2.30am\n\nProbably _not _a good idea then. He tore a length of parchment off the end of a scroll and scribbled his suspicions down then charmed it to fly over to Dumbledore's office before making his way- yawning- to his bed.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen impatiently waited for Moody's lesson on the benefits and draw backs of the conjunctivitis curse to end- he wasn't the only one not paying proper attention either. Harry was practicing over and over again the wand movements for the spells they had been teaching him, he seemed oddly calm considering what was coming, but then again, he had always worked well under pressure, Allen just hoped that the task would be all he was facing and not some crazy death eater- though he guessed, now that Crouch was missing, the crazy death eater no longer had his puppet and there was no way anyone would be able to sneak into the school, security had reached a whole new level of crazy with the goings-on at the school so maybe everything would be fine… still. He couldn't help but feel worried for Harry, beginning to understand now a little of what Hermione had meant in her rant to him earlier that year. Finally the bell rang and Allen hung back as the student body poured out of the classroom. He approached the teachers desk trepidously<p>\n\n\"What do you want, boy\" Moody growled\n\n\"Lookin' for extra work?\" He snickered at his own joke, stumped over to his chair, lowering himself into it heavily\n\n\"Ah, no sir, actually, I was wondering if you could help me out, I'm sure you know by now that Dumbledore and I have been speaking to the ministry regarding Akuma, I was hoping you perhaps would have some useful information about them\"\n\nModdy eyed him curiously\n\n\"I worked as an Auror boy, not as one of those Magical Creature nut-cases. Never came across an Akuma in my life. Sorry I couldn't be of more help\" He shrugged one shoulder and twisted his face into what might have been an apologetical smile- Allen couldn't quite tell.\n\n\"Thanks anyway, sorry to bother you\" he smiled politely and backed out of the room, he turned the corner of the corridor and dug the book out of his bag again- yes, it definitely said 'Alistor Moody' surely there couldn't be more than one wizard in the ministry by that name- it wasn't exactly common. He wavered for a moment before turning on his heel and hurrying back to the library… he had enough good-student points with Flitwick to get him off skiving one class (or so he hoped). He needed to get to the bottom of this… something was just bugging him about this whole situation and the final task was tomorrow. Something just made him worry that this was all linked somehow. He ducked past Madame Pince's desk and slipped silently through the tall bookcases to the section on the ministry. At the bottom of one of the bookcases, there was a pile of dusty untouched files, containing a record of the ministry's employee's. Tim fluttered around his head, stirring up little eddy's of dust with his wings as Allen shuffled through the piles, eventually finding all the pages with Moody's name spanning his career in the ministry-and yes, he had begun in the Magical Creature's committee before moving to the Auror's office. Why had he lied then? he felt like he was teetering on the edge of a breakthrough… tantalisingly beyond his reach. It just didn't make _sense _\n\nhowever, before he could figure anything out Tim suddenly jerked and projected a report in the air in front of his face. Allen stood up, the screes of paper spilling off his lap and tumbling to the floor. He didn't even notice and just gaped at the shaky video feed that was playing showing thousands upon thousands of Akuma streaming out of the sky upon a village full of people. The image shivered and he could hear the panicked yells of the finders. There was a crash and the camera fell to the ground, the picture showing the terrified face of the finder who had been holding it for a few seconds before he crumbled into dust. Allen snatched Tim out of the air and turned, running full pelt out of the library ignoring the yells coming from Madame Pince's desk\n\n\"Tim!\" He yelled as he scrambled up the staircases on his way to the seventh floor\n\n\"I need you to go, I need you to tell Dumbledore\" He fell to the floor with a thud and struggled to his feet again\n\n\"Tell him where I am, tell him what happened, then tell him… tell him there's something weird about Moody tell him\" He screeched to a stop beside the creepy ballerina-troll tapestry\n\n\"I don't know, I don't really know what I found just tell him… tell him somethings not right, show him what I found. Can you do that?\" Tim frantically clung to Allen's shoulder, clearly figuring out that his master was planning on leaving him behind\n\n\"Look! I have no other option, I'm really sorry, please. Just do this for me. And Tim? Stay with Mai will you while I'm gone? Just… Just look out for her ok?\" He could practically see the tears on Tim's face and a pang shot through his heart\n\n\"I'm really sorry\" He rubbed his thumb gently over the golem's head \"but I need to go. I'll be back, I promise\" He ducked into the room of requirement and dug through his piles of stuff, clipping the belt from Dumbledore around his waist and attaching the black order badge he had 'borrowed' from Kanda to the front of his robes. He grabbed the broom from its corner and stared at it for a second- there was no way he would get there in time if he flew. He took a deep breath- this could get him into SO much trouble, but he had no option! He closed his eyes and concentrated hard, touching his wand to the broom, focussing on his intended destination with all his might \"_Little Hangleton in 10 seconds, Little Hangelton in 10 seconds\"_\n\n\"Portus\" He said, the broom glowed blue and then dulled. With some trepidation, he grapsed the broom handle\n\n\"10, 9, 8…\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Kanda swung his sword again, sending his illusion creatures flying towards the next onslaught of Akuma, he used the cover it brought him to duck around the back of one of the tall stone houses, pressing his back against the wall as he tried to catch his breath. It had been non stop since the morning and even <em>he <em>had his limits.\n\n\"Hey Kanda!\"\n\nHe spun around in complete disbelief. There was no _way _was that irritating, good for nothing, useless, excuse-for-an-exorcist _kid _wasactually here\n\n\"So this is fun, huh?\" Allen said chirpily, grinning at the pissed off wannabe samurai. Kanda mearly glared with increased venom and 'tsk'd' irritably\n\n\"How is it _you_ get here before the order\" He muttered, rotating his stiff shoulder, trying to ease his aching muscles\n\n\"Oh, I don't know\" Allen grinned, greatly enjoying himself \"Maybe life just hates you\"\n\n\"You have no idea\" Kanda muttered and stood up seemingly deciding that facing Akuma was preferable to continuing the conversation\n\n\"This way\" Allen said, joining him and pointing toward the town square\n\n\"We need to draw them away from the house, I met a group of the towns people and a few finders and I just led them in there\" Kanda rolled his eyes and resisted the urge to strangle the irritating bean sprout with difficulty\n\n\"I'm not here to babysit a bunch of weak idiots\" He spat however, he did follow Allen's lead, drawing the Akuma into the town square, not that it was very difficult. As soon as they showed their faces, the cry of '_Exorcists' _went up and hordes of Akuma converged on them. For a moment, the two were completely obscured by the bulbous bodies before Kanda's underworld creatures burst through their bodies one one side and glowing blue crosses blossomed on the bodies of the Akuma on the other side. Allen and Kanda both burst out of the sphere of Akuma, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. Allen gritted his teeth as he cut down another line descending on them from above, Kanda slicing through the Akuma converging on them from the sides.\n\n\"Oi, sprout\" Kanda yelled \"To your left\" Allen spun around, just in time to see the building he had gathered the town people in begin to crumble\n\nAllen gasped and- barely missing a swipe from one of the nearby Akuma, he pulled his wand from his belt and pointed it at the house \"_Arresto Momentum_\" he yelled desperately, trying to cut his way free of the Akuma. He ploughed his way through all the ones in his path, leaving Kanda to deal with the remains as he ran over to the building which his spell had halted mid-collapse. He levitated the bigger stones off till he eventually came to the room that the terrified people had gathered in. He cast a shield spell around the room, he was just finishing the protective charms to prevent the Akuma from seeing or hearing them when Kanda slammed down beside him on the ground\n\n\"Some help you are\" He sniped\n\n\"Not that I really expect much from you, but your job isn't to protect every sorry soul you come across, its to attack and kill Akuma\" He gave Allen a rather disgusted look\n\n\"Oh for goodness sake\" Allen sighed struggling to control his irritation\n\n\"You're not some defenceless child! I knew that you could handle the remaining Akuma- these people on the other hand had no chance\"\n\n\"What do you think you're doing anyway\" Kanda asked, glancing suspiciously at the wand Allen was holding. Allen did his best not to give a snide reply and instead settled for a petty show of his skills\n\n\"Reparo\" He said calmly, sweeping his wand over the crumbling brickwork and he savoured the look of shock on Kanda's face as the bricks soared up from the ground and reattached themselves to the building\n\n\"Back up there a bit will you?\" He said sweetly\n\n\"Repello Inimicum… Protego Maxima\" He finished the spell with a flourish and a shield shimmered momentarily around the house before it disappeared. Kanda squinted at the building suspiciously\n\n\"What did you do to it?\" He growled, clearly irritated at having to even ask \"It looks weird now\"\n\n\"Its a protection charm\" Allen said simply \"Should stop the Akuma from noticing it. You and I will be able to see it, as we know where it is but it should stop another attack. Plus now we have somewhere to shelter if we need to\" Kanda glared suspiciously at him\n\n\"How?\" He grunted\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you\" Allen laughed \"Heads up, incoming\" he nodded behind Kanda to another line of Akuma who had spotted them\n\n\"Shall we?\" He grinned and Kanda shot him a smirk before sweeping past him\n\n\"Try to keep up, short-stack\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>The Earl grinned manically at the recent footage they had of Tiedol- this one wouldnt get away from him! Deciding not to take any chances, he sent Tyki along with Lero who was currently whizzing around, sending data from the town to the Earl. He passed over the town's graveyard when lights and buzzers burst into life across the screen<p>\n\n\"Interesting\" The Earl grinned leaning closer into the screen\n\n\"And what do we have going on here\"\n\nSeconds later, a small rat-like man scurried across the screen and the Earl sat bolt upright in his seat. He recognised that slimy little hairball from Voldemorts enterage- that combined with the impressively high levels of dark magic could only mean one thing. That pain-in-the-backside of a wizard was alive- and was regaining his body. He had _known _something was up! The arms of his chair splintered under his grip and the giant grin grew manic but all of a sudden, he sank back in his chair, his grip loosening. He knew what to do, it worked out perfectly actually. He needed to get a hold of Tiedol anyway and he had grown tiered of dealing with things in secret. It was about time to show the world what he was made of- his army was already more than big enough and why not show the order the full extent of his powers while drawing as much attention as possible to the scene of Volemorts come back. Yes, this would work out quite nicely...\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Almost two hours later, Allen burst through the door of their new safe house and crumpled to the floor. He gulped deep breaths of air in trying to slow his hammering heart<p>\n\n\"Tch. Weakling\" Kanda snarked, shooting Allen a rather superior look which probably would have been a lot more effective if he hadn't looked half-dead himself. His hair was hanging out of the pony tail and was sticking out at odd angles. Allen just rolled his eyes, unable to form any sort of coherent reply as his lungs seemed unwilling to function. Eventually, he managed to get enough energy gathered to sit up. He dragged himself over to one of the walls and using it as support he dug through his belt, pulling stacks of cauldron cakes and chocolate frogs out, pleased that he had thought to fill it up with the remainders of his Christmas candy stash rather than gorge on it as he had been so sorely tempted to do. Kanda shook his head in disgust as Allen shovelled the sugary treats into his mouth, pausing every now and again to cast a 'gemini' charm to multiply the food. Once the sugar kicked in, he stopped feeling so shaky and gathered all his supplies together and multiplied them before slipping out of the room and handing them around the survivors and remaining finders who were posed at every window at the ready for any Akuma who wondered too close to the building. He half considered offering some to Kanda but remembered the guys weird obsession with Soba and decided not to risk his wrath by offering sugary treats\n\n\"Hey, that looks pretty serious\" He said gesturing to a large gash down Kanda's side\n\n\"Yeah, but as I am not a 5 year old _girl\" _he shot a pointed look at Allen \"so I'm sucking it up\"\n\nAllen raised an eyebrow unimpressed and pulled his medicine chest out of Dumbledore's belt and flipped open the lid.\n\n\"Here\" He pulled out the small vial of 'E_ssence of Dittany' _and lent over to apply it to the wound but Kanda slapped his hand away\n\n\"Do you take me for an idiot?\" he snarled \"I'm not letting you touch me\" Allen sighed and rolled up his sleeve revealing a shallower cut. He applied a few drops to the wound and held out his arm for Kanda to inspect. He grunted as he saw the skin seal up over the wound and- rather reluctantly- removed the protective arm he had over his wound. Allen squeezed a few dropper-full's of the liquid over the wound and bit back a snarky comment, settling instead for an I-told-you-so look as the wound sealed up. Kanda glared moodily in the opposite direction, pretending not to notice.\n\n\"You know\" Allen said, packing the vials away again \"A simple 'thank you' would suffice\" Kanda swiped his still-sheathed Mugen at Allen as an answer, grinning in satisfaction as it connected painfully with his ribs. Allen crumpled to the ground, moaning pitifully. Kanda very deliberately stepped on him as he made his way over to the window again\n\nAllen joined him and looked out at the sky still thick with Akuma\n\n\"I can't believe how many there are\" He said, his expression sad as he stared out across the burning, destroyed town crawling with Akuma\n\n\"Where did they all come from?\" He turned to face Kanda\n\n\"Is this what the Earl meant by setting the stage for the next act?\"\n\nKanda glowered at him again but obviously decided that he couldn't really take offence to that question\n\n\"He's been amassing an army while we've been trying to find accommodators. Unfortunately human weakness is much more common than human accommodators so here we are hopelessly outnumbered in a battle for the world\" The flames of small fires in the town flared up and the flickering light they threw out lit his face. He turned to face Allen, his eyes blazing with their red light\n\n\"This is why when given the choice, you protect your fellow exorcists- finders are replaceable, humans are replaceable but accommodators? We are not. Your purpose is to protect you're comrades and destroy Akuma not to risk your life for every bleeding heart you pass- its pure selfishness. The innocence chose you- for whatever reason- and now you have an obligation to live, to live to destroy as many of the Akuma as possible. If you die, you should die fighting the Earl as part of the Black Order, not sneaking around on some suicide mission to protect humans\" His voice grew louder as he said this and Allen was rather shocked by the passion in his voice- he had never really seen Kanda get so worked up about anything nor had he even been aware that he was capable of such complex emotions as pride and duty\n\n\"I am sorry\" He said fixing his grey eyes on Kanda's cobalt ones, trying to convey his sincerity \"I understand what you're saying and I'm sorry I haven't joined up with the order before- I know its not a great excuse but one of the reasons I haven't joined up until now is that I have been training- that thing I did, it was magic, I've been learning how to use it properly but I promise, I have never forgotten what my true purpose in life is- I am an exorcist above all. I know that we are hopelessly outnumbered and of course I would protect my fellow exorcists to my very last breath but humans and finders matter too\"\n\nKanda tsk'd again at this and muttered something that sounded like 'naive little child' under his breath. Allen sighed\n\n\"It's true\" He insisted rather more forcefully\n\n\"What would be the point in saving this world if there were no humans left? They are what we are fighting for so of course we should protect them! Besides, the way you speak about destroying Akuma, its like you think we kill them or something- every time you destroy an Akuma, you set the human soul within it free to pass on, so even you protect and save humans, for all your grumpiness\" He smiled teasingly at Kanda and was slightly taken aback by his companions expression of shock\n\n\"What do you mean 'save' them?\" He asked, his voice sounding rather odd. Allen was slightly surprised by Kanda's confusion- surely, surely he didn't believe that when he destroyed Akuma, he was simply killing them? There was no way the order would let their exorcists believe that! I mean, how could you live, thinking that every time you destroyed an Akuma you killed the human soul within it. A horrible feeling swept over him as he contemplated the thought of believing the only way to save the world was to kill innocent humans made into Akuma through no fault of their own- no wonder Kanda was so scathing of humans, no wonder he seemed uncaring. How could you care and still do that?\n\n\"Kanda\" He said rather more gently \"I can see the souls of Akuma with my cursed eye. Every time we destroy the Akuma body, the soul contained within its released and allowed to pass on to paradise, I see it every time. They do not die\" Kanda stared at him for a while as if trying to figure out if he was lying before muttering\n\n\"Whatever\" and walking over to the other side of the room and curling up\n\n\"You should get some rest too\" He said\n\n\"We'll head out in 2 hours\"\n\nAllen however remained at the window staring out into the darkness. He could see in the windows reflection that Kanda's eyes too remained open, his expression blank and unreadable.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen had sunk into a doze his eyes half-lidded and his cheek squashed up against the window pane. He jerked awake with a start when a golden light flared up across the sky. Kanda noticed to and leapt up from his position on the floor. He nodded to Allen and the two exited the house and headed toward the light, trying to avoid the roaming packs of Akuma as they went. It didn't take long to reach the edge of the town. Allen and Kanda stood at the top of a grassy slope which led down to what looked like a bleak grave-yard however that was not what was attracting Allen's attention- he was gaping up at the golden cage suspended impossible in mid air holding his best friend and Voldemort. Completely throwing caution to the wind and abandoning all pretence of subterfuge Allen screamed<p>\n\n\"HARRY!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry's arm trembled as he tried to maintain his grip on the shaking wand. He had absolutely no idea what was going on- never in his life had he even heard of magic like this. Running purely on instinct, he concentrated with all his might on the small beads that were wavering up and down the beams of light connecting him and Voldemort. Behind them small lights flickered in the village- Harry had no idea what was happening there either, at first he had thought Voldemort and his cronies had set fires purely for fun- like they had at the World Cup but Voldemort had cursed and said something about an 'Interfering Earl'. He however didn't figure out why the name 'Earl' sounded so familiar until he heard a very familiar voice call his name. Despite himself, he took his eyes off the wavering lights emitting from his wand. His wand vibrated violently as he did so and he immediately whipped his head back round but he had already seen the last person he expected to illuminated in the golden glow of the weird cage that incased him<p>\n\n\"Allen?\" He called his voice unnaturally high \"What are you doing? Get away\" panic started to rise in his stomach. Allen couldn't die too, he just couldn't. Not another Cedric.\n\n\"Allen?\" He glanced quickly up but his friend was still standing there, an expression of shock on his face\n\n\"What should we do my Lord?\" One of the nearby death eaters... Avery he thought called\n\nHarry trembled in trepidation and the words he most dreaded came from Voldemort's mouth\n\n\"Kill him\" he hissed venomously his snake like eyes narrowed in concentration. The small beads of light leapt down the line connecting the two wizards and Harry barely managed to stop them before they connected with the end of his wand which was now trembling even more violently and emitting tremendous heat. A bead of sweat rolled down Harry's forehead as he focussed all his energy on those small beads of light, the same mantra playing over and over in his head\n\n'please let him be ok, please let him be ok...'\n\nThere was a loud curse from one of the Death Eaters and an explosion. This time it was Voldemort who glanced away and Harry was able to force the beads a few more inches away from his wand\n\n\"Put up a barrier you fools\" Voldemort shrieked, fury in his eyes\n\n\"Don't let those things anywhere near me\"\n\nHarry glared at the beads of light, willing them to move- a feeling of relief blossoming in his chest. Allen was alright. If anything had happened, Voldemort would be crowing his victory over him right now and if a barrier was being put up they wouldn't be able to cast any spells at him. Voldemort seemed to notice the relief in Harry's face and his new found resolution\n\n\"I wouldn't be so pleased\" He spat halting the procession of the beads\n\n\"That boy is as good as dead now, the only difference his death will be\n\nslow and painful unlike the swift death of Avada Kedavra\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen's eyes widened as the death eaters all raised their wands simultaneously. Acting purely on impulse, he tackled Kanda to the ground and threw up a barrier around them. It shattered under the force of the spells but thankfully did its job. Allen twisted around and summoned another barrier as he and Kanda scrambled backwards. There was a loud noise and the ground beside them exploded, showering them with dirt and grass. Allen, thinking it was a spell, turned in the direction of the graveyard to see the Death Eaters backing up with looks of fear on their faces casting a large protective barrier, which shimmered iridescently with power. It dawned on him what the explosion must then have been when something collided painfully with his shoulder. Allen let out a yell of pain and stumbled forward. A level two had obviously come to investigate the noise and now seemed overjoyed at finding the two exorcists. Kanda was already engaging it in a fierce fight however he was struggling. The Akuma was some-what cat like, with long sharp claws that he seemed to have the ability to shoot like javelins and regrow. Allen gritted his teeth and drew the long spike of metal out of his shoulder before joining Kanda in the sky. The blades seemed to be everywhere at once and both Allen and Kanda were forced into defensive roles, barely managing to keep its claws from them. Allen's shoulder throbbed painfully with each blow and blood started to soak through his robes. Kanda too gained some cuts but they sealed themselves relatively quickly. Sending a quick glance to Allen, he nodded slightly. Allen then backed up slightly and transformed his arm into its gun form, launching a barrage bullets. The Akuma screamed as the golden globes of light collided with its body- it swiped furiously at Allen- who just barely escaped the razor points. Kanda grinned and pointed his katana at the Akuma's exposed back \"Second Illusion: Underworld Creatures\" He intoned. The creatures collided with the Akuma and it was blown forward, catching Allen by surprise and knocking him out of the sky. It let out an unearthly screech and turned to Kanda<p>\n\n\"Do you really think you can beat me with such a weak attack?\" It snarled, moving faster than Kanda's eyes could register. It appeared before him in a split second\n\n\"My move\" It hissed, viciously driving its claws into Kanda's abdomen\n\n\"The Earl will be pleased with me\" it snickered as Kanda clutched the claws, gasping in pain as he tried to pull them out of his body to free himself from its grasp. The Akuma's laugh grew louder but turned into a shriek as Allen reappeared by his side and sliced through the claws, releasing Kanda from its grasp. He drove his gun into the Akuma's belly and shot a quick succession of bullets. The Akuma seemed to glow and swell as its body filled with the power from the bullets. Its eyes bulged in shock\n\n\"Cursed exorcist\" It yelled, embracing Allen, its claws slicing into his back\n\n\"If I must die, you are coming with me!\" Its grip grew tighter but it was too late. Allen's bullets blasted a hole strait through its middle and he smiled weakly as the spirit of a middle-aged woman was released from its cage. His vision flickered slightly and he fell from the sky, catching a brief glimpse of another stream of level ones pouring in from the town. He landed painfully on the rubble scattered on the ground beneath him. Summoning all his energy, he crawled over to Kanda's innate body, the rocks and rubble cutting into his knees and hands as he tried to keep as low to the ground as possible. His hand slipped on some loose pebbles and he tumbled down a small hill to where Kanda had fallen. He lay frozen briefly, his eyes fixed on the sky- breath completely driven out of his body when his cursed eye started freaking out, as one of the akuma spotted him. Jerking into action, he threw himself over Kanda, who groaned in pain as Allen jogged his body then cried out again as a barrage of bullets collided with Allen back causing his arms to gave way and he fell heavily on top of him . Allen twisted around and shot the Akuma out of the sky, using the cover their explosions gave him to scramble over to a nearby, half-destroyed building, doing his best not to jog the three spikes still sticking out of Kanda's abdomen as he dragged him along. He gingerly ducked through a hole in the door, avoiding the jagged edges of the wood and heaved Kanda through then lay slumped on the floor breathing heavily the light shining through the door flickering as Akuma passed by. Kanda sat up with some considerable effort and slumped against one of the crates that littered the floor\n\n\"Don't suppose you've got a couple plasters or something\" He slurred, his eyes flickering as he struggled to maintain consciousness. Allen pulled himself together and joined Kanda, his breathing still laboured his hands trembling slightly as he cut the material away from the incision sites. Kanda turned a faintly green colour and closed his eyes, swallowing hard thankfully not seeing Allen pull out his wand and touch the tip to the first spike empaling his abdomen. Allen closed his eyes, trying to ignore the ringing in his ears as he tried to recall the third chapter of 'Healer's Helpmate'. He took a deep calming breath and began to cauterise the first puncture site. It took about three times as long as it should have but eventually he had sealed up the blood vessels and the holes in the organs the claw had pierced. He gently eased the claw out and washed the incision site with a few of the healing potions before beginning the laborious process of re-joining the arteries and organs. He repeated this process with the next two. Kanda regained consciousness about half way through healing the second one\n\n\"Urgh\" he groaned, pulling a face\n\n\"That feels awful- how are you doing that\"\n\n\"Told you\" Allen answered shortly, deciding to prioritise the healing over politeness\n\n\"Magic\"\n\nKanda asked another question but the buzzing in Allen's ears grew even louder and he just shook his head, pressing his hand to his mouth as he tried to hold back a wave of nausea that swept over him. He just finished up with the last incision when the whole world swung violently and the floor seemed to leap up, colliding painfully with his head.\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Kanda caught the white-haired boy as his eyes rolled back in his head and he crumpled to the ground. He gently rolled him over onto his stomach, his hands sticky with Allen's blood. He peeled the blood soaked robe off Allen's back and pulled a face at the many lacerations across the young boy's body. Clutching his own abdomen, he limped over to the back of the building which- as it turned out- was a small grocery shop. He grabbed a few water bottles and medical supplies from the back of the shot and sank down beside Allen, hissing in pain as the newly healed muscles complained loudly.<p>\n\nAllen's eyes flickered open and he blinked rapidly as the room slowly came into focus. He frowned in confusion as Kanda flitted in and out of his vision, his brain slowly rebooting as he began to make sense of the scene.\n\n\"Hey\" He rasped, his throat bone-dry\n\n\"The orange potion. Put a few drops in water. Pout it on the worst cuts. Don't get any on your hands though.\"\n\nKanda lifted up the small glass bottle and frowned at it\n\n\"Why can't I get any on my hands?\" He asked suspiciously. Allen just shook his head, nausea rising again\n\n\"Just do it please. Losing blood here\" He laughed weakly, starting to feel rather giddy. Kanda rolled his eyes and added a few drops of the thick liquid to one of the bottles and shook it. The water turned a violent shade of orange and the plastic grew warm under his grasp\n\n\"Allen\" He asked, rather cautiously \"Exactly what will this do?\" Allen's face was even paler than usual and a sickly sheen of sweat covered his brow\n\n\"It'll cauterise the wound. Stop the bleeding. Too out of it to use magic. Just… just do it quickly ok?\" He shut his eyes tight and tensed up in preparation for pain. Kanda shook his head in confusion and poured the liquid over the deepest cuts across Allen's back from the Akuma's deadly embrace. He yelped in shock and fell backwards as smoke billowed up from where the liquid landed and Allen let out a muffled scream of pain- having covered his own mouth with his hand\n\n\"What the heck did that do?\" Kanda yelled waving the smoke away. Allen couldn't respond at all- barely clinging on to consciousness as it was but as the smoke cleared, Kanda could see for himself what the potion had done. The cuts- they were no longer bleeding and actually looked a few days old and had scabbed over slightly. Allen rolled over onto his site and retched violently, but didn't manage to bring anything up. He groaned and stumbled away from the blood-soaked patch of ground he had been lying on\n\n\"Its an exothermic potion\" He explained horsely, grabbing one of the unopened bottles of water \"Seals wounds with heat\" He gave up trying to twist the lid off and offered it to Kanda who- surprisingly- didn't even make a snarky comment and just opened it and handed it back. He glowered moodily at Allen to make up for it\n\n\"We're equal now\" He muttered and snatched his golem out of the air, moving further back into the shop to contact the other exorcists. Allen downed about half the water in one go and promptly threw it all back up again. Groaning, he moved again further back into the shop and drank the rest of the water more slowly, after adding a few drops of the 'blood replenishing' potion. That seemed to do the trick and the nausea began to fade away, the rushing noise in his ears fading too. He could hear Kanda in the background\n\n\"Marie, Daysha, I'm fine- held up on the outskirts of the town. Walker is here too\"\n\nAllen tuned him out again, turning to something much more interesting- food! He didn't think he had ever felt this hungry in his entire life and he was shut inside a grocery shop! He indiscriminately began shovelling food into his mouth, his body seeming to burn through it as soon as he swallowed it- he began to feel distinctly less weak and shaky as his blood sugar levels reached an almost normal level. He was just finishing off his fourth baguette when his brain finally kicked in- Harry! He scrambled to his feet and ran to one of the windows. The golden cage had disappeared from the sky and the graveyard was now almost completely hidden in the darkness. He couldn't see anything! He turned and made for the door but he had barely moved more than a few steps when something solid collided with him and he hit the ground painfully\n\n\"What do you think you are doing Baka?\" Kanda snarled\n\n\"We are surrounded by Akuma and you are barely able to stand, let alone fight\"\n\n\"Get off\" Allen shouted, his voice muffled under Kanda's arm\n\n\"Harry- I have to go help him\" He struggled fruitlessly against Kanda's grapes\n\n\"There's no one out there\" Kanda retorted, tightening his grip and glaring at the irritating teen\n\n\"He might be hurt! Or dead\" Allen chocked out \"Please! I need to go, I might be able to help. He is my friend Kanda. _Please- _that man he was up against- he is one of the most dangerous wizards in the world- I have to do something- he is my _friend\" _He stopped struggling and fixed his blazing gaze on Kanda, Kanda's gaze however did not waver at all\n\n\"Look, baka, even if he is there, there is nothing you can do. If he really is your friend I'm sure he'd want you to protect yourself or whatever\" He seemed to struggle to get the words out- clearly not enjoying actually helping Allen\n\n\"Look\" He sighed irritably \"do whatever you want ok? Just remember, there are more lives rely on you than just that one\" He released Allan's arm and returned to the golem in the back of the shop and Allen sank to the floor, trembling slightly, dearly wishing that Kanda hadn't just made so much sense. He dragged a few of the food crates over to the window and settled down on the sill, peering out across the dark graveyard. Where had Harry gone?\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Harry, was currently slumped in one of the chairs in Dumbledore's office, his face pale. He had no idea if Allen had survived the attack and he was unable to get the image of Cedric's sobbing father clutching his son's dead body out of his head. He was utterly exhausted but his mind just wouldn't shut up and now he had to relive the whole the experience over again. Fawks' heavy weight was warm and comforting against his legs and he absentmindedly petted the bird<p>\n\n\"Let him have a sleep\" Sirius pleaded with Dumbledore\n\n\"Let him rest\"\n\nHarry felt affection for his Godfather flood through him but he knew that he had no choice. Dumbledore gently but firmly pushed the point and Harry eventually conceded. Memories flooded back as vividly as if it was happening all over again- the shimmering surface of the potion, for foreboding shadowy figures of the Death Eaters, Cedric's unmoving body, Allen, screaming his name from across the graveyard, the terrible explosion. Somehow speaking about these horrible visions out loud seemed to diminish them slightly- they seemed as he spoke them aloud- more and more like a story, like something that had happened to another unfortunate boy called Harry. Both Dumbledore and Sirius seemed shocked when Harry told them about Voldemort taking his blood and Harry thought for a moment that Dumbledore looked rather triumphant when he told him about Wormtail putting it into the potion. He couldn't vocalise the terrible experience of seeing Cedric and his parents spew out of Voldemort's wand though- despite his best attempts to do so and Dumbledore thankfully filled that part of the story in for him, figuring out somehow that Harry's wand had forced its brother to regurgitate the spells it had cast.\n\n\"I saw Allen there though\" Harry said trying to smooth over the akward moment and fob off any further questions- Sirius had gone white as a sheet when Dumbledore mentioned James\n\n\"He was attacked sir, there was one of those Akuma creatures- what was he doing there?\"\n\nDumbledore sighed slightly and looked older than ever\n\n\"I got a message from Timcampy- I'm afraid more was going on tonight than Voldemort's return. It appears that the Earl decided to take this opportunity to showcase his power- in my opinion in was an attempt to bring attention to Voldemort's return but that is all conjunction. Allen left to go save as many people as possible- I am afraid he has yet to return\" He frowned and looked rather worried\n\n\"I would not be overly concerned, Allen does know how to handle himself however... it has been a few days- he disappeared before you went on your final task. He really should have made contact by now\"\n\nHarry suddenly remembered something- he knew Allen had gone before his final task, he remembered being rather irritated that he had gone on a mission rather than see Harry to his final task. He was regretting that now\n\n\"Tim's not with Allen, sir\" He said as Sirius helped him to his feet\n\n\"He's with Mai- I went looking for Allen before my task and saw him there\" Dumbledore frowned in confusion\n\n\"What on earth is he doing there?\"\n\n\"Oh\" Harry yawned \"Allen was all stressed about some prophesy Trewlany made about the one he loved being harmed or something. Probably wanted her protected\"\n\nHe stumbled through to the hospital bed, eternally grateful to Dumbledore for fobbing off Mrs Weasly's advances and allowing Sirius to stay. He swallowed the potion Madame Pomfrey offered him and drifted off almost immediately into a mercifully dreamless sleep. Dumbledore strode past Harry's bedinto the small nursery where- sure enough- the little gold golem was hovering above Mai's bed. As soon as Dumbledore entered the room it flapped excitedly over to him but after flying around him three ties and realising Allen wasn't hiding anywhere, it slumped down onto the back of a chair\n\n\"I know you have your orders\" Dumbledore said gently to the small creature\n\n\"But I swear to you we will protect Mai in your absence. Your master needs you Tim\" The golden golem practically bounced off the chair flew twice quickly around Dumbledore's head before rocketing out the window at a powerful speed\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen, Lavi and Lenalee stood, staring in disbelief at the rows upon rows of white coffins that lined the streets of the small town. Kanda had disappeared off with Marie and Tiedol to mourn Daysha's death. Lavi and Lenalee had arrived not long after Allen and Kanda's encounter with the level two but they had been too late to save anyone<p>\n\n\"I just can't believe it\" Lenalee said hollowly\n\n\"It doesn't seem real\"\n\nAllen reached out and put an arm around her shoulders unable to think of anything to say. Lavi sat down beside them and sighed heavily\n\n\"6 exorcists are dead too\" He shook his head\n\n\"Akuma in numbers like that... its really starting to kick off now\"\n\nAllen hummed in agreement and glanced up at Lavi- unused to his being so serious. All the childish glee seemed to have disappeared from his face and he looked oddly old as he looked across the devastation of the battle\n\n\"Things are getting serious- now the true war begins. I really hope you don't hold this against me Allen\" He said, sounding truly genuine. Before Allen could ask what he meant, Lavi clipped the familiar black collar around his neck and slipped the bracelet over his wrist. Allen groaned and dropped his head onto his knees\n\n\"Really? Again?\" He asked in exasperation\n\n\"I'm afraid so\" Lavi shrugged \"We need to track down Cross and your the only link we have to him- considering how hard you are to get a hold of this is the only way we can guarantee your compliance. Its been upgraded since last time too so you wont escape so easily\"\n\n\"I would have helped without this you know\" Allen said, seriously \"But as for tracking down Cross, I'm not going to be any use at all to you- I have no idea where he is\"\n\n\"You don't need to\" Lavi said, glancing up at the sky \"Your golem was originally build by Cross and can track him down. Where is he anyway?\"\n\nAllen let out an internal breath of relief- it was a good thing he had left Tim with Mai after all, he knew Cross would not be happy with the order tracking him down and Allen knew (or rather, hoped) that the reason he was avoiding them was because he knew some secret way they could defeate the Earl and he needed to be free of the order to do it so the more he could delay the search, the better\n\n\"I'm afraid I really won't be much use to you at all then... you see, I don't have Timcampy with me\"\n\n\n\t44. Chapter 44\n\n**I realise that this is more than a little belated but stuff and things have been happening and I have been busy :S To make up for it, things happen! And chapter is long :D plz love me!**\n\n**Cana99: Meh. We shall see what happens. I do hope you don't stop reading though and I cross my heart and hope to die that none of my writing will ever be anything close to x-rated**\n\n**Shirubagure: I will do my best to write it well though its hardly without the realms of possibility. People rarely stay with their childhood sweethearts. Yay Kanda and Allen bonding time :P T'was most fun to write!**\n\n**Will if the Abyss - AllenxRoad: Eesh, now I feel even worse about how long i made you wait for this chapter! Its even longer than the last though if that helps at all :D Yeah, I really do love winding Kanda up- he is just so easy to irritate and his reactions are so darn cute! (man I sound like Lavi...). Looking forward to our plan to smuggle Lavi into Hogwarts- should be fun!**\n\n**Diavo: Urgh I know! Dubley-dore can do some rather silly things but at least Allen will get his beloved pet back... right?**\n\n**Ennael: Heh... so I may have made you wait a little for this chapter... and I may have done another cliffhanger... but I'm back! yay... right? Book 5 shall be fun- Allen will be there for a significant portion of it and there will be Allen x Umbridge showdowns! It'll be magical :P**\n\n**DeeRoseWalker: Yeah, Yullen is my kryptonite too but it just didn't work with this story :/ But of course Crown Clown and Neah will appear! I can't write a story without my favorite characters :D**\n\n**PoisonousDemon: Lol, poor Dumbledore! He was only trying to help. I find making him do silly things rather amusing considerng how clever and together he always is**\n\n**coronadomontes: Yeah, cramming two huge stories into one is proving more difficult than I though- especially since my plan is to have both battles at the same time- this is not going to be fun!**\n\n**dcdc123: *sigh* good thing at least one person isn't out for my blood because of my belated posts! *hugs* Oh wait... you are! Save me from the mob! *flees* Hope you like this chapter ;)**\n\nAllen, Lenalee and Lavi all stared at the battered military van in front of them\n\n\"Please\" Lavi groaned \"Please someone tell me that this is some kind of joke. Or terrible dream and that I am going to wake up and find that this ISN'T our only means of transport\"\n\nLenalee let out something between a sob and a laugh\n\n\"Korea! Of course he was last seen in KOREA\" She seized the front of Allen's jacket, her eyes wide and crazy\n\n\"Do you have any idea how far away Korea is Allen? Do you? Do you have any idea how many nights we are going to have to spend without heating and electricity and internet? I _like _my internet Allen! I really, _really_ like my internet\" She sank dramatically to her knees\n\n\"Life…failing… can't… go on\"\n\n\"Look, none of this is my fault!\" Allen protested loudly over Lenalee's wails and Lavi's whining\n\n\"Blame my stupid master! And blame your brother\" He shot at Lenalee \"He's the one that said we weren't allowed to fly!\"\n\n_\"Every time we have gone after Cross in the past, he has found out and disappeared before we caught up with him- he's a smart guy with access to computers and we think he is monitoring flights- he can tell when the Order books a plane and he knows all of you so there is no way we can sneak up on him that way. Now, the intel we have on his whereabouts is pretty solid and we have Allen so this time we are taking no chances. We have to go low tech. Under the radar so to speak so it is boats and cars till we reach his presumed destination.\"_\n\nAll three teens turned again to look at the truck. The second glance didn't improve it at all. It looked like it have travelled through several war zones- bullet holes riddled the sides and some of the bigger holes had been clumsily welded over with silver metal which stood conspicuously against the dark camouflage pattern. There were only two seats in the cabin and the canvas stretching over the back of the truck looked alarmingly flimsy. Lavi and Lenalee turned to glare at Allen again and he quailed under their furious stares\n\n\"I'm sorry!\" He cried defensively \"I promise this has nothing to do with me\"\n\n\"Oh yeah\" Lavi huffed \"You with your stupid lost golem and your stupid master and your stupid ineffectual magic. Who else should we blame?\"\n\nAllen sighed. This was going to be a long and uncomfortable trip.\n\n_\"OK, we just got our report from Kanda and the finders you rescued. So, you have _magic_ you say. And you have been at a school teaching you how to hone this power for the past… 3 years?\" Komui looked up at Allen in askance, his glasses perched at the end of his nose and his brow furrowed_\n\n_\"Yes\" Allen sighed \"I _am_ really sorry I haven't informed you of this sooner but you must understand, this is a very delicate situation, the wizarding world is trying to remain hidden from the muggle- I mean non-magical people. I and my Headmaster have been working with the ministry of magic to try and convince them to cooperate but as of yet they are reluctant to believe us and I am technically breaking about a thousand laws by even telling you that they exist.\" He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair_\n\n_\"I am more than willing to help out where I can however… the wizarding laws are strict and well… Dumbledore can only cover for me so much. In other words, once the summer holidays are over, I must return to school. The laws are very strict about that. I cannot leave until I graduate or am expelled and well, to be honest, I think you all need my magic to help you with this war so the first option is really your best one\" Komui was unwilling at first to agree but after much cajoling from Allen, he said he would 'do what he could' which didn't exactly fill Allen with confidence however it was better than nothing so he decided to let things be for now._\n\n_\"Listen\" Komui said rather conspiratorially as he riffled through his desk for some papers he had lost (though how he ever found anything in that bomb site was a mystery to Allen)_\n\n_\"Would you mind… showing me some of this magic?\" His eyes had lit up with a rather manic glint as the mad scientist in him bubbled to the surface. Allen shook his head and smiled apologetically_\n\n_\"You really don't want me to do that either. After that destruction in Little Haddington- well- the ministry have probably discovered my absence and even if they haven't, they will be on high alert for any unexpected magic. My wand still has the trace on it as I am under 17 so if I perform magic, they will know immediately and probably apperate here and arrest me before I can say abracadabra\" _\n\n_He spent the next 10 minutes convincing Komui that abracadabra wasn't actually a spell and only succeeded in distracting him from this topic by bringing up Lenalee (and then hurriedly assuring Koui that yes, he did have a girlfriend and he therefore didn't need to be castrated)_\n\n\"The magic wouldn't have been a huge amount of use anyway\" Allen wheedled as the two of them glared bore holes into his head\n\n\"Illegal Portkeys are _incredibly _illegal and we have no floo powder and I can't dissaperate even by myself let alone with a bunch of other people. I'd probably splinch you all. And end up in the wrong place so you know this really isn't my fault.\"\n\nLavi and Lenalee stopped glaring and their angry expressions were replaced by perplexed looks of confusion\n\n\"Portkey?\" Lavi repeated blankly\n\n\"Splinched?\" Lenalee asked, wincing slightly at the sound of the word\n\nAllen groaned and thumped his head gently against the side of the battered van\n\n\"We are going to have to travel in this beat up truck for weeks\" He half-sobbed \"Weeks! Plus we are going to _freaking Korea. And _Bookman won't let us travel up front coz he says since he and the finder are older than us, they need the extra comfort more than us\"\n\nAll three of them groaned in unison. There was a long silence as they all stared despondently at the truck\n\n\"At least it isn't North Korea\" Lavi said eventually with a vague note of optimism in his voice\n\n\"_It's Korea, Lavi\" _Lenalee hissed venomously \"Korea! As in… As in Korea!\"\n\n\"Yeah but…\"\n\n\"Freakin' past France, Germany, Kazakstan, RUSSIA _and_ China- Korea\" Leanlee cut him off, her voice rising to a hysterical pitch\n\nAll three of the groaned again\n\n\"We are gonna die\" Allen said matter of factly after another long silence\n\n\"Yup\" Lenalee and Lavi chorused dully\n\n\"We are going to break down in the middle of nowhere\" Lenalee sighed\n\n\"Or get cooked alive\" Lavi pointed out \"We have to travel through France and Belgium and Germany in _summer\"_\n\n\"And then\" Allen continued in an equally depressed tone \"We have to travel through Ukraine and Russia and possibly Kazakstan. That means border control... lots and lots of border control\"\n\n\"Unless of course they decide to go through Iran, Afghanistan and China. You know, just for kicks\" Lavi chipped in\n\n\"In which case\" Lenalee continued \"We will get shot as well as getting cooked alive and breaking down in the middle of nowhere\"\n\nBookman exited the hospital and matched over to the truck, two rucksacks about as big as he was slung over his shoulder. He flung them with apparent ease into the back of the truck and took a double take at the three teenagers slumped on the curb.\n\n\"What are you three doing lounging there\" He snapped \"We are leaving in four hours. You had better be packed\"\n\nThey exchanged looks and scrambled to their feet in a flurry of action (Allen and Lavi almost fell over, getting tangled in the chain that was joining them before righting themselves and sprinting back to the hospital where all their belongings currently resided).\n\nThree hours later the three of them reconverged in front of the truck lugging their own rucksacks behind them, Lavi and Allen bickering as they went\n\n\"I'm just saying\" Allen said \"You maybe should have packed some more essential stuff you know?\"\n\n\"Scrabble _is _essential Allen\" Lavi insisted\n\n\"Oh yeah, and I suppose Yahtzee, Uno, Monopoly, Snap, Snakes and Ladders, and Domino's are also essential\" Allen countered \"Did you actually pack anything useful?\"\n\nThey threw their bags into the back of the truck in unison and joined Lenalee on the kerb again. She had stretched out across the pavement, the sun shimmering across her hair, bringing out the green tints. She cracked open an eye as the two boys plopped down beside her, yawned and stretched lazily, then propped herself up on her elbows, watching her friends bicker with mild amusement.\n\n\"We are going to be trapped in this stupid truck for a number of weeks- you'll thank me. I promise. Besides _you _packed a travel iron. A _travel iron_. Who packs a travel iron?\" Lavi scoffed rolling his eyes at Allen\n\n\"Well excuse me if I actually care what I look like\" Allen muttered grumpily ignoring Lenalee and Lavi as they sniggered at him. They three ribbed each other for a while before organising the bags into a neat pile in the corner of the trailer. They stared at the bare metal floor and benches along the side\n\n\"We have to travel in this for, like, a month\" Lenalee said\n\n\"We _cannot _travel in this for a month. Come on, we still have another 40 minutes or so before we have to leave\"\n\nShe grabbed Allen's sleeve and dragged him (and by proxy, Lavi) to the nearest bargain store. The two boys obediently followed Lenalee around the shop with a trolly as she dropped cushions and patterned blankets into it muttering to herself on the way about the many different ways in which she was going to punish her brother for sending them on this mission in that junk pile of a jeep. Allen and Lavi exchanged concerned looks as she grabbed a packet of superglue, tarpaulin and a cooler box.\n\n\"Err… Lenalee\" Lavi began trepadously as she proceeded to add a few packets of brightly coloured beads and sequences in too\n\n\"Please bear in mind that we- two boys- have to travel in this trailer too\" but she just waved a hand dismisevly at him then seemed to consider what he said and threw a couple packets of air freshener in too\n\n\"That wasn't quite what I meant\" Lavi muttered moodily\n\n\"You'll thank me for this later too\" she laughed, finally adding a few balls of twine and marching the two boys up to the checkout.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what all this stuff is for?\" Lavi hissed to Allen as they gathered up the bags and followed Lenalee back to the jeep. Allen shook his head and shrugged and they sped up to a light jog as Bookman yelled at them to hurry. They piled into the back of the van and grabbed a hold of the only remaining leather strap hanging from the celling in order to keep balance as Bookman twiddled the wheel, swinging the truck round in a huge semi-circle and joined the traffic streaming out of the town. The first few hours of the trip were dedicated to decorating the back of the truck on Lenalee's strict orders into what was beginning to resemble a gypsy wagon. They pinned and superglued brightly coloured cushions to the hard iron benches, transforming them into sofas. Two of the blankets were strung up across the opening at the back of the trailer and tied back with a few lengths of ribbon to act as a curtain. Lavi and Allen then glued the lengths of tarpaulin over the inside of the canvas ceiling to waterproof the compartment while Lenalee bejewelled the legs of the benches and the cooler box which she sat in the middle of the trailer to act as a coffee table. The dull inside of the army vehicle was all of a sudden magically transformed. The roof was now bright blue due to the tarpaulin, the seats were a mix-match of jazzy patterns. The 'curtains' were a plain greenish colour to blend in with the camouflage on the outside of the truck and the ribbons holding the curtains open allowed the daylight to stream in, causing the bejewelled cooler box and chair legs to throw out bright coloured lights all over the trailer. Even Lavi eventually admitted (though it took some encouragement) that the trailer looked significantly better. Lenalee grinned broadly at the confession though the second she turned her back, both Allen and Lavi grabbed the glue gun and spare gems and threw them out the back of the trailer\n\n\"Now\" Lavi sighed \"What to do… if only someone had been thoughtful enough to bring games by which we could amuse ourself…\"\n\n\"Oh shut up\" Allen snapped\n\n\"SNAP\" Lavi yelled slamming his hand down on the pile of cards. All three of them lunged backwards for the Yahtzee dice which was at the other end of the trailer. Allen snatched it a few seconds before Lavi and threw the dice ignoring Lenalee and Lavi's moans of disappointment, as he cackled in triumph. As he tried to score a full house, Lavi reached over and added ten tallies under his name on the scoresheet headed 'Snap the Ladder, Yahtzee!'. The rules were simple. The game began with Snap, whoever got snap first gained 10 points. They then had to race to the Yahtzee and whoever got there first gained however many points the dice gave them then all three played snakes and ladders- the dice rolls counted for points. If they landed on a ladder, the points were doubled and if they landed on a snake, the points were halved. Super simple (It was Lavi who had come up with the game, surprisingly enough)\n\nAllen groaned as he missed the full house and went for a run of threes instead. He resignedly joined Lavi at the score sheet, adding 9 points under his name. They scrambled over to the snakes and ladders board and were about to throw the dice when the car braked to a halt at a set of traffic lights.\n\n\"GO, GO, GO!\" Lenalee screamed and all three of them vaulted over the tail gate of the truck, hitting the ground simultaneously. Lavi wrapped the extra lengths of chain joining him and Allen together around his wrist and sprinted along the road with Allen by his side. They sped past the cars lined up at the traffic lights and over the half deserted crossroad. The brilliantly bright summer sun beat down on the back of their necks and lit up the corn fields at the side of the road in a glorious shade of gold. Lavi ignored the scenery surrounding them and bowed his head, concentrating on his feet pounding on the dusty road but it was no use. Lenalee streaked past them, her legs pumping so quickly they were a blur. She shot a cheeky grin back at them as she overtook and let out a whoop as she increased her lead by a not-insignificant distance.\n\n\"Oh come _on\" _Lavi yelled irritably at Lenalee's back. Allen twisted around quickly to look behind them\n\n\"Bookman is coming\" he shouted. He grabbed Lavi's arm and pulled him on as he sped up but Lenalee was a good 9 meters in front of them now and Bookman was through the lights and catching up quickly\n\n\"Come on, come on, come on\" Allen muttered\n\n\"Argh no\" He groaned as the truck pulled up beside them. Lavi turned sharply so they were both running behind the truck\n\n\"On the count of three then\" He said despondently\n\n\"1…2…3\" They leapt in unison and spilled painfully onto the floor of the truck. A few seconds later, Lenalee jumped in too and let out a cheer. She did a little victory dance over to the 'Stop-Light Racing' scoresheet and added another mark under her name\n\n(The rules here were also simple. Every time the truck stopped, they leapt out of the trailer and sprinted as far as they could before bookman caught up with them again. It was a point a race- Lavi and Allen being one team as they were still connected by Komui's chain) the game had begun really to stop them all expiring from the sheer amount of pent up energy that being stuck in a metal box will produce\n\n\"So\" She said dramatically \"The score is currently ah… 23 points to team Lenalee and 0 points to team Laven\" she hummed cheerfully to herself and danced over to the snakes and ladders game where she plopped down happily \"Funny\" she said as she rolled a 4 and fell down a snake \"Thought I just heard a group of fangirls screaming there… never mind. Must be imagining things\"\n\nAllen and Lavi joined her at the snakes and ladders game where Allen streaked ahead claiming the snakes-and-ladders-winning prize of 50 points but Lavi, in a brilliant rush of luck got 'Yahtzee' and a royal flush then thrashed both Allen and Lenalee in snap, streaming ahead of the both of them and winning the final prize (a fun sized packet of Malteaser's) which he proceeded to eat gloatingly in front of the other two. Lenalee and Allen rolled their eyes irritably at him and pretended not to notice him, instead having a very loud conversation about the weather.\n\n\"IT'S SUNNY TODAY, ISN'T IT LENALEE?\" Allen yelled as Lavi munched very loudly on his pack of malteasers\n\n\"YES INDEED ALLEN, IT IS SUNNY. THE SUN IS VERY BRIGHT AND SHINY AND HOT\" Lenalee hollered back at him.\n\nLavi chuckled superiorly at them and- having had his fun, he crawled over to the cooler box. He pulled out the giant world map he had bought in the bargain store when Lenalee wasn't looking. He shook it out over the trailer floor, weighing the ends down with chocolate bars (from Allen's horde). Lenalee interlocked her fingers and stretched widely, yawning\n\n\"So, where are we now?\" she asked curiously, leaning over the map too. Lavi trailed a finger over the map of France\n\n\"Well, we have been driving for… what, 4 hours since we left the Orders Headquarters in Paris this morning… so we should be close to the Alsace border now. No more than an hour or so I would say.\n\n\"I want lunch\" Allen whined, massaging his stomach which was making a whole cacophony of strange noises\n\n\"We should be coming up to Strasbourg soon\" Lenalee said consolitoraly. She got to her feet with some difficulty with the swaying of the truck. She grabbed a hold of the leather strap and stuck her head out of the back of the truck, stepping up in the tailboard so she could see over the top of the roof.\n\n\"See anything?\" Lavi asked as he stuffed the map back into the box\n\n\"Come up here\" She laughed, ducking her head back into the compartment, her hair mussed from the wind and eyes shining brightly. Allen and Lavi awkwardly manoeuvred their way around the chain joining them and with some difficulty they joined her. The hot summer wind whipped through their hair and cooled them down somewhat. The three grinned widely as the wind seemed to blow all the cobwebs away. They waved energetically at the drivers who passed, all giving strange looks at the military truck with three teenagers hanging out of the back trailer. A particularly bored truck driver pulled up alongside them and waved out the window\n\n\"Salut, Gosse! Qu'est-ce que tu fais? Vous pourriez tomber vous savez\" **(Hey kids, what are you doing? You're going to fall if you're not careful)**\n\nAllen smiled and waved politely\n\n\"Nous allons être très prudent, je promets monsieur. Merci beaucoup\" **(We will be very careful, I promise. Thank you sir)**\n\nThe truck driver chuckled and waved his hand dismissively at them, beginning to overtake them\n\n\"J'espère que cous avez une bonne journée, monsieur\" **(Hope you have a good day, Sir)**\n\nHe winced as the baked canvas began to burn his hands and he dug through his pockets for his gloves, his distraction causing him to miss the surprised look exchanged between Lavi and Lenalee. They clung on till the sun became unbearable and then they retired to the cool interior of the trailer with significant relief. About an hour later, they entered the city of Strasbourg. Bookman pulled over to the side of the road and gruffly told the teenagers that he had 'some things to take care of' and that they were to make their own way to a meeting point at the other end of the city in 4 hours. He left Lenalee with a small bundle of notes and Lavi with the threat of many painful punishments should he fail to behave himself. Lavi rolled his eyes as Bookman pulled away\n\n\"Skinflint\" He scoffed\n\n\"There is barely enough money here for food for all of us. Especially considering that we have Allen with us\"\n\nAllen stuck his tongue out at Lavi but the news seemed to concern him.\n\n\"Come on\" He said urgently. He marched the other two through the city, muttering to himself. Lenalee and Lavi exchanged concerned looks\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Lenalee hissed to Lavi who shrugged\n\n\"Trust me\" Allen said, giving them a rather scary smile. They left the main street and wandered through a few back streets before eventually walking into a dark, musty building. The sign was so decrepit that it was impossible to make out the words but Allen marched strait for the door, only stoping when the chain snapped taught. He looked back at Lavi and Lenalee who all looked slightly terrified\n\n\"Trust me\" He repeated\n\nThey entered the dank and musty building. Allen muttered a few words in French to the man at the front desk, passed over a few euros and entered a large pair of double doors quilted in a dirty red velvet. Lavi and Lenalee exchanged scared looks and followed the determined strides of Allen. Allen strode up to one of the tables and smiled politely at the three men seated there\n\n\"Good afternoon gentlemen\" He said smoothly bowing slightly with his hand over his heart. Lavi and Lenalee glanced at each other again- English?\n\nOne of the men, elderly and immaculately dressed turned in surprise\n\n\"My mother tongue\" He exclaimed delightedly \"I an very grateful to hear it- My french is quite poor I must say, despite my Eton tutors best attempts. Never did pay much attention in my studies. Tell me, what can I do for you, boy?\" Allen's grin widened\n\nAn hour later and Allen's table had an audience of 20 as he swept another handful of chips towards himself, smiling politely at his opponents. The English gentlemen had folded a few rounds back and was now just sitting back, watching Allen with mild amusement. Lavi and Lenalee were sitting awkwardly behind Allen (The opponents refused to allow the two near them- so convinced were they that Allen was cheating). Allen bowed out of the game after halving his opponents chips- this was how he had left all his other opponents. He refused to clean them out, and insisted on stopping once he had halved their money in a sign of respect. The three retreated to the bar and ordered a round of cokes rather dejectedly as all their companions cradled wines and scotches in their hands.\n\n\"How'd you cheat?\" Lavi asked curiously, draining his glass in one (it was ridiculously stuffy in this room)\n\n\"I was watching you and I didn't see anything. I never miss _anything_\"\n\nAllen grinned as he saw a muscle tense in his jaw. Lavi really couldn't deal with not knowing\n\n\"I didn't cheat actually\" He said haughtily \"I only ever cheat if my opponent cheats first. Then its only fair\"\n\nThere was a cry from one of the other rooms, leading off the scruffy yet ornate room. Allen exchanged curious looks with his friends and then made his way towards the door it came from. Lavi yelped as the handcuff snapped taught. He hurried after Allen before he was knocked off his feet and Lenalee scurried after them, shooting a nervous look over her shoulder to the exit. Allen walked through the door to a significantly scruffier room. A young man with a streak of white through his hair was wailing rather pathetically\n\n\"I don't understand\" He was crying to a group of three messily dressed men who chuckled dispassionately at him\n\n\"Why do I have to play this game again?\" the young man cried, his naivety actually visible on his face\n\n\"Oh its traditional in France\" One of the scruffy men chortled- looking very pleased with himself. They had stripped the man right down to his underwear. Allen stepped forward fluidly\n\n\"Good afternoon, gentlemen\" He said, this time a note of steal in his voice\n\n\"I'll be taking over from my friend here if you don't mind\" He stepped forward and sat down beside the trembling man who glanced up gratefully, tears streaming from his eyes which almost immediately lit up\n\n\"Lavi! Is that you?\" He cried. Allen turned to look at Lavi who smiled in recognition\n\n\"Krory! I thought you were meeting us at the Order- Bookman is on his way to meet you\"\n\n\"I was on my way\" the unfortunate man sobbed \"But then these men here- they told me I said something offensive in French when I was asking for directions and this was the only way to pay back my disrespect\"\n\nAllen frowned in disapproval at the three men and expertly shuffled the cards in the middle\n\n\"Is it agreeable with you that i be his substitute\" He asked politely. One of the men with messy hair and large glasses grinned cockily and lent forward, taking the cards from Allen's hand and dealing them out\n\n\"Lets go, shounen\"\n\nAn hour and a half later, they exited the building. Lenalee and Lavi looked rather shell shocked and Allen was grinning ear to ear, thumbing through a large pile of bills. They had left the three unfortunate men with only the clothes on their backs, though it had been a rather friendly parting actually- the leader seemed to respect Allen's ability to scam even more effectively than them. Allen ran his thumb over the cards the leader had given him- it was a nice deck and he had really beginning to miss gambling. He chuckled darkly as he stuffed the money into his pocket and both Lenalee and Lavi shuddered. Dark Allen was _freaky. _Krowry seemed starstruck by Allen and trotted behind the group, admiration shining in his eyes. They wondered into the nearest restaurants where Allen proceeded to order every meal on the menu much to the shock (and disgust) of their waiter.\n\n\"I didn't know you spoke French\" Lenalee said as Allen translated the menu and ordered for them\n\n\"I don't really\" Allen said shyly\n\n\"I'm not fluent or anything, I only know a few words. There was someone in one of the circuses I worked with who spoke only French so…\" He tailed off and shrugged then concentrated on shovelling more food into his mouth Lenalee opened her mouth to ask another question but Lavi dunted her leg under the table and shook his head minutely. Allen's head was ducked and a light flush had spread across his cheeks. It was clear he was very self conscious about it and would rather they didn't make a big deal about it. Lenalee shot Lavi a rather confused look but went along with it and instead started ribbing Lavi about the three woman who had slapped him in the gambling bar after he tried (unsuccessfully) to flirt simultaneously with all three of them. Conversation eventually drifted off into relationships and both Lavi and Lenalee were incredibly interested in Allen- the only one to actually have a girlfriend- Krowry sunk into a state of depression so deep that he was incapable of joining in the conversation and rather blubber quietly into his quiche Lorraine\n\n\"What's she liiiiike?\" Lenalee sang cheerily\n\n\"Ah, she is really quirky\" Allen laughed \"Like she walks around in this little world of her own and most of the time you have no idea what she is talking about or where her mind is. But she is really sweet and accepting and kind and loyal\" Lenalee's eyes sparkled as she grinned\n\n\"Thats so sweet!\" She chirped\n\n\"Does your heart fill with love and warmth every time you speak to her?\" Lavi teased gleefully \"Do birds burst out in song every time you see her face? Does her voice make you just want to listen to her speak for the rest of all eternity?\"\n\n\"You know\" Lenalee said in a rather surprised tone \"For such a terrible flirt, you are quite the romantic\"\n\n\"You know what the say\" Lavi laughed \"you've got to kiss a few toads…\"\n\n\"What?\" Lenalee snorted \" Before you get your handsome prince?\" Lavi thumped her shoulder causing her to burst into hysterical giggles and the waiter who was approaching with Allen's next round of food to scowl in disgust\n\n\"How hot is she?\" Lavi directed to Allen, twitching his eyebrows, then yelped when Lenalee thumped him back. Hard \"What!\" but Allen just laughed\n\n\"Ah, its fine. I think she is anyway. She's got… like sort of dirty blonde hair and pale blue eyes and she's like… super delicate, really tiny frame\" He shrugged and ignored Lavi as he began to beg for more detail than he was willing to exchange.\n\nThey left a small bundle of notes on the table with a rather generous tip- Lavi hadn't really wanted them to, seeing as how the waiter had been both snooty and rude however Allen insisted\n\n\"Its hardly his fault I have the appetite of 10 rugby players. Plus we are chained together and none of us exactly look normal- that's weird enough enough to throw even the most trained waiter\" He said as he replaced the notes Lavi had lifted from the table. They wondered slowly through the town, unwilling to exert any more than the minimal amount of energy possible. The sun beat down on the back of their heads, slowly sapping all of the energy out of them. Lavi was staring wide-eyed at the architecture around them and so jerked violently in shock when Allen yelled\n\n\"6 Akuma!\" and followed this by transforming her arm and shooting two bullets directly over Lavi's head and one over his shoulder before Lavi even had time to catch on.\n\n\"4\" He said calmly, spinning to the left and cutting down another two looming up behind Lenalee\n\n\"3,2\" he continued, causing her to flitch too. He turned to take care of the one to his right but Lavi got there first, a look of defensive triumph on his face (He didn't appreciate the fact that Allen's reflexes now matched, if outstripped his own). Allen pouted slightly and returned his arm to normal, walking on as if nothing had happened. Krory cracked a smile for the first time since they had met and bit deeply into the nearest Akuma. Lenalee wrinkled her nose delicately as he drained it with relish, smacking his lips\n\n\"I was starving!\" He cried delightedly \"I couldn't eat a thing at that restaurant- not with thinking about… about… my dear Eliade!\" He snivelled pathetically but his eyes lighted on the next Akuma and much to everyones delight, he moved on to it instead of wailing about his lost love again\n\n\"A bit of warning next time would be nice\" Lavi snipped, running lightly to catch up with Allen who shrugged nonchalantly. He had always been pretty rubbish about working as part of a team, though Lavi guessed this was because he was used to fighting on his own. It wasn't that he didn't get on well with, well, pretty much everyone, it was just that- it was hard to explain- he didn't factor into his fighting style that there were other equally talented exorcists. Not that he was arrogant or that they through the shouldn't fight so well, just that he would take enormous risks or push himself to the limit forgetting that he didn't have to kill all the Akuma because Lave and Lenalee would get the ones he couldn't. To be honest, he seemed to have gotten worse since the village massacre which Lavi supposed was to be expected but now he was pushing himself far further than he really should. Lenalee and Lavi had both noticed that his arm was beginning to look very strange and they remembered what Komui had told them about parasitic type innocence- when damage was done to the innocence, as it was linked to the wielders body, it harmed them too and had to be left to heal just like a real flesh wound.\n\n\"We are pretty good fighter too ya know! Right, Lenalee?\" He turned back to get conformation but Lenalee was scaling the wall of one of the buildings on their left, using the uneven brickwork and balconies as stepping stones\n\n\"Wha…?\" Allen turned back too and they both craned their necks to watch her as she scrambled up onto the tiled roof. He gaped in shock as she danced lightly along the apex of the roof to where a very fat cat was flopped, baking in the sun.\n\n\"What is she… doing?\" Allen asked blankly but Lavi had seen what Allen had not- something gold was glinting in the mouth of the cat. He glanced down at Allen's confused face and on impulse declined to tell him. He was looking forward to the reaction he would give if that cat really had what Lenalee thought he had in his mouth. Lenalee stroked the cat gently, causing it to rub up against her. She gently reached inside its mouth and tugged out a damp and struggling Timcanpy. Allen's jaw dropped and he gaped wordlessly at Lenalee as she climbed back down with irritating ease. Lavi grinned- it had SO been worth it. He searched Allen's face while he was distracted looking for an emotion- relief or concern. That was what he wanted to know. Was Allen happy or upset that Timcanpy was found? Did he really want Cross to be found? Or was this all a rouse, were they working together on some side project, trying to keep it hidden from the order? There were so many questions buzzing around his head but Allen's face was unreadable. He scowled internally in annoyance. He was so used to being able to figure people out but Allen… he just couldn't read him. No matter how hard her tried and it was irritating him to no end. Being left out of the loop? That happened to grunts, not to him. Not to bookmen. Lenalee landed on the ground beside them and offered the damp Tim to Allen. Allen grinned and took the golem from her, drying it off with his shirt sleeve. He gently rubbed its head with his finger, murmuring non-sensical nothings under his breath to it as he tried to wake him up. Tim stirred at the sound of his masters voice and kept into life when he saw Allen's face. He buzzed around his head frantically before settling on the top of his head, snuggling comfortably down into his hair. Allen chucked and hugged Lenalee\n\n\"Thanks!\" He chirped cheerily as they turned to walk back down the street. Lavi hummed nervously under his breath. The other two turned to look at him\n\n\"What?\" Lenalee asked\n\n\"Err… I don't know how to tell you guys this… but we have to meet Bookman in 20 minutes. The checkpoint is 4 miles away\" A shocked silence followed this, then as one, all four of them sprinted through the town.\n\n21 minutes later, they skidded to a halt in front of the army truck. Bookman was perched meercat-like on the bonnet of the truck, sipping a mug of green tea. He observed the teenagers in mild amusement over the top of the mug and smiled slightly as they collapsed, panting on the pavement in front of him\n\n\"Well, aren't you four in a hurry\" he chuckled\n\n\"Funny, I did calculate how long it would take you to get here. I even gave you an hour leeway. I'm curious, did you crawl?\" his smirk grew slightly. Lavi tsk'd impatiently but Allen seemed unable to contain his inner politeness\n\n\"I am very sorry sir\" He said hurriedly\n\n\"We got rather side-tracked on our way here, went to see some of the local… ah… sights. It was entirely my fault, so we got slightly delayed. I really do apologise\" Bookman sniggered at this\n\n\"Ah don't worry about it. I figure being trapped in the back of the suspension-less junk heap for weeks on end counts as punishment enough. Besides, you picked up what we came here for\" He nodded towards Krory, who was significantly less out of breath than the other three- his helping of Akuma blood giving him unimaginable power much to the annoyance of his companions who were red-faced and gasping for breath\n\n\"We have something that will make up for all this\" Lavi said, a grin spreading across his face. For a moment it looked as if Bookman wouldn't ask but then his curiosity got the better of him.\n\n\"What, Lavi\" he snapped, the self-pleased expression disappearing from his face\n\n\"Well, on our travels, we came across something rather interesting\" Lavi said, his grin widening even more. He slipped his hand into Allen's pocket and removed Timcanpy who had fallen asleep snuggled up in the corner. He held it behind his back, his smirk growing even further\n\n\"See, we were wondering up one of the side streets… I believe it was called Rou des Foulons. Had a lovely coffee shop… well we were walking along there, it really was a very pretty area…\"\n\n\"Oh for heavens sake! Spit it out boy!\" Bookman snapped and Lavi held the slowly stirring Timcanpy out between his thumb and forefinger, his grin now basically splitting his face in half as he gleefully watched the shock spreading across his face. Not that it would have been noticeable to any one other than him. There was just the slightest contraction of his eyebrows and the most minute frown tugging at the corners of his mouth, but it was enough for Lavi. Bookman jumped down off the hood and snatched the golem from Lavi's hand\n\n\"Get in the trunk\" he grunted irritably\n\n3 days later, and the games they were playing became even more complex- they were now half way through Poland and the temperature had dropped rather significantly. They sat snuggled in blankets around the bejewelled cooler playing a combination of snap and phase 10 (if two of the same numbers were put down in phase ten, it turned into snap (1 point) completing a phase was 1 point and winning the 10th phase was 10 points) for every snap, they got three rounds of monopoly (whoever had the most money at the end of the three turns got 1 point, whoever won the whole game of monopoly got 20 points. If someones points added up to a multiple of 5, they got to ask a have-you-ever question and if someones answer was 'yes' to the question, they got a bonus round on monopoly. The rules (shockingly enough) had once again been made by Lavi and he was having great fun keeping Allen and Lenalee right (he was also beating them hands down because every time they messed up the rules, he deducted a point)\n\n\"Ooookay\" Lavi said having just reached 60 points\n\n\"Have you ever… Crossdressed?\" He grinned as Lenalee stuck her tongue out at him\n\n\"I'll take that as a no\" He laughed \"Krory?\" The man laughed and shook his head\n\n\"Allen?\"\n\nThere was a long uncomfortable silence as Allen turned a deeper and deeper shade of red\n\n\"Allen?\" Lenalee repeated, a smile spreading slowly across her face\n\n\"No judging okay?\" He blurted, now a terrible shade of puce \"I didn't have a choice!\"\n\nThe other two stared expectantly at him \"Spill. Now\" Lavi enthused, his eyes practically sparkling\n\n\"I was in India\" Allen muttered his eyes focussed on his hands which he was twisting together in embarrassment\n\n\"I may or may not have won a whole lot of money from a guy who turned out to be… ah… rather important. And rich. And powerful. And as it turns out, a very, _very _sore loser. He sent a couple people out after me and well, I am rather easy to distinguish so… ah… I may have had to resort to wearing a Chador and Sari for the rest of my trip\" He refused to make eye contact with rather of the other two who were howling in laughter at him. He moaned and buried his face in his hands\n\n\"What's a Sari\" Krory asked blankly\n\n\"It an indian _dress_\" Lenalee snorted\n\n\"More to the point, what is a Chador?\" she asked. Allen just moaned again so Lavi answered for him\n\n\"It's one of the Muslim head ware things. Covers pretty much everything but the eyes and nose. Pretty good disguise I guess. Still. Fact remains, you CROSSDRESSED!\" And he and Lenalee burst out into laughter again while Allen curled up into a small ball of shame on the floor. He refused to un-curl till they promised not to laugh. Or make 'amused' eyes at each other. Or in fact make eye contact with each other at all. Eventually, after the laughing stopped being so funny and started being painful, Lenalee and Lavi stopped, clutching their aching ribs. Allen emerged, his face still pinkish and eventually they began a game of snap again\n\nConversation eventually wondered back to the subject of magic which Lenalee and Lavi were endlessly curious about\n\n\"What about the wand?\" Lenalee asked excitedly \"Is it made out of some magical substance? Is it like Innocence?\"\n\n\"Sort of\" Allen replied patiently \"The wand itself is made of wood but it contains a core of a magical substance. The type of wood, length of wand and magical substance varies depending on the user.\" He picked up his wand and twirled it lazily between his fingers, viewing it with some affection. It trailed a fine line of gold sparks from the tip and he spun it around much to Lenalee's delight\n\n\"What is yours made of?\" Krory asked curiously, watching Allen's fingers as he sped up, causing the wand to become a blur\n\n\"Ah, well, it is made from Rowan wood and the core is Unicorn heartstring\" **(1)**\n\n\"What does that say about you?\" Lavi asked, his interest piqued\n\n\"Well… Olivander said that it was the only wand of its type in existence- Unicorns are rather sacred creatures you see and _no one _kills them. This one died of natural causes at a relatively young age which was also very rare so some wand maker decided to make a wand out of it about 45... 50 years ago **(1)** and no one was compatible with it so he doesn't really know what characteristics suit the core. Rowan wood though suits the 'pure-hearted and clear headed' apparently, its supposed to be really protective of its owner and be especially suited to defensive charms though its hardly a hard and fast rule\"\n\nLavi nodded as he silently recorded the information, storing it under the 'Allen Walker' file before tuning back into the conversation where Lenalee was cross-examining Allen about how potions were brewed and this conversation kept them going right across the border into Russia\n\nRain streamed through the gaps where the canvas met the metal of the truck and transformed the base of the trailer into a mini pond. The teens were huddled together in a little circle at the back of the compartment sitting in their sleeping bags with the tops pulled over their heads, shielding them from the rain dripping with steady plops from the canvas roof. All three were shivering violently and swaying with the motion of the truck which was ploughing its way through what felt like a solid wall of water. They sat in complete silence, the only noise coming from their chattering teeth. Lenalee had fallen asleep against one of Allen's shoulder and Lavi was asleep on the other. Krory- who appeared impervious to the cold was lying stretched out on the other side of the truck, curled up snugly in his sleeping bag, sleeping soundly causing Allen's attitude toward the naive man to drop significantly. He was so cold he didn't think he would ever manage to get to sleep ever again- the cold had penetrated right down to the bone and his every muscle ached with it. Though his shoulders were warm, so he had that going for him. Which was nice. Lavi stirred and slowly opened his eyes\n\n\"Ow\" He croaked \"I think my fingers are about to fall off\"\n\nAllen tried to raise an eyebrow to convey his sarcasm rather than actually have to speak however his face was so frozen that he couldn't even manage to do that.\n\n\"They've… n-no-not gone purple…. y-y-yet... so… you're p-p-probably fine\" he spat out between chattering teeth glancing down at his fingers which were bone white and purpling slightly at the tips\n\n\"Hate my d-dumb ci-circulation\" He grumbled\n\nLavi looked rather concerned then noticed something else\n\n\"Where's your coat?\" He asked, tucking his own hands under his armpits. Allen squirmed slightly and ducked his head\n\n\"Where is it?\" Lavi repeated, his tone warning\n\n\"Lenalee's uniform is just so short!\" Allen protested gazing plantatively at Lavi \"She was freezing to death\"\n\n\"And now you are\" Lavi sniped \"Congrats. Here…\" He unzipped the sides of his and Allen's sleeping bags and shuffled over a bit, tucking the ends around them. He wrapped his arms about Allen's side, and pulled him close. Lenalee moaned as her 'pillow' moved from under her but she didn't wake up and just switched position slightly as Allen snuggled down into Lavi's side, curled up into a little ball in a vain attempt to retain what little heat his body had remaining in it and sank into a light doze till the truck finally screeched to a halt at a B&B. It took about 15 minutes for the three in the back to even straiten out. Their joints seemed to have welded together from a combination of the cold and not moving. Lavi ended up having to half drag Allen out and Lenalee fell painfully as soon as she stood up. As a group, they stumbled through the door and let out a moan of relief as they saw an open fire. Moving as one, they half fell towards it, collapsing on the hearth. The landlady let out a cry of shock when she saw the three half-frozen, soaked-through teens crumple onto the ground.\n\n\"Akh ty bednyazhki, chto sluchilos's vami!\" (**Oh you poor things, what happened to you?) **She cried in panic. She held up one finger and ran to one of the closet, reemerging moments late with armfuls of blakets\n\n\"Khotite goryachego shokolada ?\" **(Do you want some hot chocolate?)**\n\nLenalee and Lavi looked blankly at her but Allen having regained some control over his vocal chords spoke up\n\n\"Da pozhaluysta, bol'shove spasibo. Gruzovik my puteshestvali v be vse, chto vodonepronitsayemyy poetomu my zamorozheny\" He stuttered **(Yes please, thank you so much. The truck we were travelling in wasn't all that waterproof so we are frozen)**\n\nShe nodded enthusiastically and bustled off into another room. Allen shuffled closer to the fire, clutching his blanket tightly around his body, still shivering violently. Bookman, the finder and Krory sidled shamefacedly into the room avoiding eye contact with the frozen teens. They silently lifted the room keys from one of the other assistants and stumbled off in exhaustion to their rooms electing to leave the other three to their own devices.\n\n\"Exactly how many languages _can _you speak\" Lavi asked, unable to contain himself after they had warmed up sufficiently to be able to speak without causing themselves significant pain\n\n\"Not that many?\" Allen said, fidgeting with the mug of hot chocolate, Lavi wasn't about to let him off the hook that easily though and the silence ran on for a good 5 minutes before Allen finally cracked\n\n\"Well, _fluently _only Japanese, English and Romany\" That however wasn't enough for either Lavi or Lenalee\n\n\"How about not fluently, you managed to hold, like, a full conversation in French last week\" Lenalee pushed\n\n\"Well, French. Obviously. Ah, Russian too- obviously. Erm then there is Slovakian, German- a smattering of Austrian... ah- I can get _by _in Mandarin, though my grammar is quite hideous. Oh! and I can speak Hindi. Can't write or read in it though\" He glanced up at the expression on the other two's faces and cringed at the shock\n\n\"I've just always been good at languages\" He muttered, flushing darkly \"I don't know, my brain is just… wired that way or something, I can just, like, hear the similarities between all the languages or something and the rhythm of the words… it just clicks in my brain. Hermione absolutely hates me for it because it means I am actually better than her in Ancient Ruins. If it makes you feel any better, I am a complete failure at maths and my directional sense is woefully tragic\" Lenalee laughed slightly\n\n\"That does make me feel a little better. Come on. I think I can walk now, and I really, really want to go to sleep now\" The boys nodded in concent and they slowly dragged themselves up the stairs. Allen muttered a goodnight to Lenalee before falling into his and Lavi's room where a rather pleasant smell hit them.\n\n\"Oh, she drew a bath for us\" Lavi gasped \"I think I love her!\"\n\n\"You can go first\" Allen muttered, stumbling over to the open fire and collapsing in a heap. Lavi nodded and released the cuff joining the two (Lavi figured that if Allen was incapable of standing, he was probably incapable of running away). Allen curled up cat-like in front of the flames, he didn't even have enough energy to remove the blanket that had bunched up uncomfortably under his side.\n\nLavi emerged from the bathroom an hour or so later, a cloud of steam following him as he went. He did a slight double take at Allen who was fast asleep on the wooden floor which looked incredibly uncomfortable. Lavi squatted down beside him and gently prodded his shoulder but Allen didn't even stir. He sighed in exhaustion but couldn't quite bring himself to wake him so he knelt down with a groan onto the floor and gently scooped him up after reattaching the cuff around his wrist. It took a few attempts to lift his dead weight but eventually he straitened up and stumbled across to the bed and lowered him onto the mattress then collapsed in beside him, falling asleep almost instantaneously.\n\nLavi woke late the next morning and had a minor heart attack as his eyelashes actually brushed against Allen's cheek. He jerked backwards and barely managed to keep himself from falling off the edge of the bed. He slumped back on the pillow as he tried to slow his pounding heart. He slipped in and out of a doze as he waited for Allen to wake up but he didn't seem to be planning on regaining cosciousness up any time soon. Eventually the boredom just got too much and he flicked Allen's forehead. Hard. Allen woke up with a moan of pain. It took a number of minutes for him to orientate himself and a few more to realise what had woken him at which point, he dug his elbow into Lavi's stomach and deliberately stepped all over him as he crawled out of the bed, apologising sarcastically as he did so\n\n\"Oh sorry… didn't see you there… totally didn't mean to knee you in the kidneys…\"\n\nBack in the truck, they began to head into China and the weather, much to Allen's delight reached a comfortable 20 degrees. They had grown bored of the ridiculously complicated games Lavi had concocted and instead, Allen was teaching them how to play 'Hold 'em Texas'. As they got closer and closer to the presumed destination of Cross, the number of Akuma they were coming across was increasing significantly which they took as a good sign that they were getting warmer. Tim had also been signalling that they are getting much closer than they had expected- Bookman suggested that Cross amy have moved from Korea into China so their travelling was slowed even more as they began to dig for some information. The going more difficult though and they were having to stop repeatedly to take down the packs of Akuma they came across. Lenalee grew increasingly concerned as she saw the toll this was having on Allen's arm. She wished more than anything that Komui was here with her. Although she was much more independent of her brother than she had used to be, she still deferred to his knowledge and missed him when he wasn't around. He would certainly know what to do about it (though she doubted Allen would be too pleased to have him fixing his arm). Allen was growing more reckless than ever about his own life however, Lenalee was struggling to condone him too much as she herself was taking more risks than she would previously have taken. So many had died back in England in that attack and she had missed it. She had been too slow, too ineffective and people had suffered because of it. Lavi too seemed to be feeling the strain and was pushing himself beyond his limits too. It was a very good thing they had Bookman with them as he had a great knowledge of medicine and- however reluctantly- patched the teens up after every reckless charge. They had been travelling though China for several days when finally they came across some useful information. Anita, the owner of a particularly upperclass brothel, confirming every suspicion Allen had about this mysterious master who's idea of caring for him had been to abandon him after Mana's death, leave him to grieve and wonder halfway across the world on his own- his only input being running up huge debts for him in every city he went too. Although Allen did understand why he did so, he could't help but feel that there were about fifty million better ways that he could have gone about protecting him. Lavi and Lenalee noticed the drop in his mood but said nothing about it, deciding it was better to leave well enough alone. There was plenty to do anyway- what with stocking up the boat they are having to take across the ocean to Japan, where Anita claimed Cross had been heading when she lost contact with him. Trepidation amongst the group was running high. If the truck they had been travelling in for the last month and a bit was ancient, this ship was prehistoric. According to Anita, that was the only option if they wanted to land in Japan which had entered isolation years previously, forbidding any vehicle from entering or leaving the country much to the anger and confusion of the other countries however contact had also been completely cut off and none was willing to make any actions that might be construed as aggressive as technically, the Japanese were at liberty to cease all trading. The social media had gone crazy at this development and conspiracies abounded but nothing had been confirmed or denied by the government. Unfortunately though that meant Cross was now inhabiting the hardest to reach country- this was even worse than if he had really been in Korea and so, they had to resort to this ancient ship that Anita claimed would fool the technology, being so low-tech as to avoid the scanners. The crew she gathered were oddly loyal to her and the teenagers were beginning to wonder if there was more to this woman than being a brothel-owner.\n\nThey had barely started on their journey before all 3 of them became violently sea sick. The wooden construction swayed violently from left to right, the deck leaning almost horizontally beneath their feet. Their journey was definitely beginning to feel a little less hopeless now though- although Anita was almost certain that Cross was dead, Bookman was equally certain that Cross was far too stubborn to do such a thing. Either way, they were far closer to him now than they had been before and besides, Allen was pretty sure that had Cross been dead, Tim would have given some sign. He had had no chance to speak with him in private as Lavi was still watching him like a hawk so he had no way of knowing what was going on at Hogwarts or what Dumbledore wanted him to do, so he was just winging it and hoping that he was doing the right thing. About the middle of the second day, Lavi noticed what he thought was a thunderstorm in the distance. He was just about to mention this when Allen's eye activated\n\n\"Akuma\" He gasped, his eyes wide and frightened \"more than I can count… I can't… there's… Lavi! There's thousands of them! Its an ambush!\"\n\nThere was a mad rush of activity as everyone went to panic stations- Lavi separated the cuff and Allen immediately flew up to meet the black cloud, disappearing in the stream\n\n\"Allen!\" Lavi yelled \"Dammit! Hiban, grow, grow _grow\" _He shot up to join Allen mid-air- both Krory and Lenalee joined shortly after, however the Akuma seemed unconcerned by their presence. They cut down as many as they could which seemed to spike their interest and more converged upon them however, the majority of the bulbous creatures continued streaming on past the ship towards the shore on to the west of the ship where the thunderstorm had lit up the sky in a garish white\n\n\"It has arrived!\" one of the Akuma crowed and Allen turned to see a monstrous creature rise above the land, the bolts of light that he had thought to be lighting extending from where the arms in the grotesque truncated body should have been. He gaped wordlessly at this impossible being before snapping back to attention as the akuma as a whole screamed \"_Kill it!\" _and charged.\n\nLenalee stared as they streaked toward the strange creature, attacking it. Whatever this creature was, the Akuma seemed to prioritise its destruction before even the destruction of exorcists. In a snap decision, she caught Allen's hand and building up power in her dark boots, she burst off through the air towards the battle on the shore, a loud boom cracking though the air as she burst through the sound barrier. They landed on the ground near the creature and stared in complete ignorance at it\n\n\"What…\" Allen gasped as he forced air back into his lungs which felt as if they had been forced through a wringer but Lenalee's eyes widened in terror as she recognised the face protruding from the monstrous body\n\n\"_SUMAN!\" _She screamed, dropping to her knees with a loud cry, tears streaming down her face. She knew what this was. She knew what had happened. She knew what he had become. Allen dropped down beside her and wrapped his arms around her trembling body\n\n\"What is it?\" He asked gently\n\n\"The Fall\" She choked as she remembered the face of that young boy… the boy who had been forced to try and synchronise with innocence as his body rejected it again and again.\n\n\"The Fall?\" Allen echoed, gently tipping her chin up so she was looking at him. Her heart ached so much she thought it might break. She _knew _Suman, they had been friends! He had been kind and gentle and his love for his family… that must have been what had done it. She refused to believe he had betrayed the cause. He would never have done that. Never. He couldn't have betrayed his friends like that. He could never have betrayed _her _like that. She looked up at Allen's confused eyes, remembering that he knew nothing of the horrors of the Order, having been shielded for so long…\n\n\"This is what happens to an accommodator when their synchronisation drops below 0% Allen… this man- he is- he was… Suman Dark\"\n\nAllen's eyes widened at this statement-he had met Suman on a few occasions in his Akuma- hunting and once when he was on a big missions with Lenalee. How could he be this monster? His innocence didn't even resemble the creature- he had been the accomidator to a similar innocence as Allen's actually and they had kind of bonded over this similarity, having long conversations about fighting techniques and how their biggest fear was damaging the innocence and having to let Komui fix it\n\n\"I..\" Lenalee choked\n\n\"I have seen something like this before. They tried to force synchronisation with someone who wasn't an accommodator to make more soldiers for our army\" She shuddered at the dark memory, a tear slipping down her cheek\n\n\"But… but he is an accommodator\" Allen said, nonplussed \"How could an accommodators synchronisation have dropped below zero?\" But before Lenalee got the chance to answer, the akuma converged upon Suman and a brilliant burst of light exploded from the stumps where the arms of the monster he had become should have been, cutting down huge swaths of Akuma\n\n\"We have to help him\" Lenalee choked \"We must. I never saw what happened to the other boy- maybe he survived? Maybe he was OK? We have to try Allen!\" A terrible sound was emitting from the creature and Allen realised, to his horror, that Suman was screaming. They shot off towards the scene of destruction.\n\nAllen grimaced as he tried to heave the body of a young girl out of the strange creature- she was half submerged in this strange gloopy substance that Suman was also submerged in. Lenalee came over and took the girl from him\n\n\"You get Suman\" She yelled \"I can't get him out\"\n\n\"She's not breathing\" Allen yelled \"You'll need to do CPR\"\n\nLenalee looked torn for a second as her eyes lingered on the immobilised Suman. Allen could see the torment in her eyes and he felt a surge of sympathy for her- her heart was so kind and she took every loss personally. He couldn't let her be responsible for Suman- if she lost him, she would never forgive herself\n\n\"I promise\" He said sincerely, resting a hand on her shoulder \"I will do everything I can to save him\" She nodded, a single tear escaping and trickling down her cheek but she set her jaw determinedly and dropped like a stone to the ground, cradling the young girls body in her arms. Another huge blast of energy emitted from the 'fallen one' and Allen could hear an increase in the volume of Suman's screams. The sound tore at his very heart and he couldn't shake the feeling that with every blast of energy, Suman's very life-force was being drained. He desperately activated his innocence and stuck it into the pool\n\n\"Stop it Innocence\" He screamed in desperation- Suman's eyes snapped open and hatred seemed to pour from their very depths\n\n\"Be cursed. Be cursed. All of you. Humans. Exorcists. Apostles. Be CURSED\" He snarled and there was a terrible jerk as the entire monstrous body began to move further inland, toward a small village. Allens insides twisted violently. He couldn't go through this again- not now- not another village of innocent people.\n\n\"Stop!\" He screamed, reaching for Suman pleadingly \"Stop it! It is our job to protect and save these people- please Suman\" But Suman seemed crazed- he snarled and sank his teeth deep into Allen's outstretched arm. Allen chocked back a cry of pain and through gritted teeth tried again to reach Suman\n\n\"Suman, please, its not too late, you can reach your innocence still, just stop destroying- do what you were destined to do. Save these people and the innocence will re-synchronise with you. Please\" He chocked slightly as Suman sank his teeth even further into his flesh\n\n\"I won't let the innocence destroy you\" He swore \"I promise you, if you stop, if you save these people, I won't let the innocence destroy you\"\n\nHe had no idea how he was going to keep this promise but he was determined to- he had to save Suman for Lenalee and he had to save the villagers for all their sakes. The ship was too far away for anyone to come help. This was down to him.\n\n\"Don't die!\" He cried but his words had the opposite intended effect. Suman clamped his teeth down and there was a horrible _snap _as the bones in Allen's hand broke. Suman loomed over the village which they had now reached and there was a terrible crack as the white lighting cut a swath out of the wooden houses. Allen's eyes widened in shock and in desperation, he activated his innocence to full capacity. The pain was terrible as his broken hand transformed but he fought through the pain and caught Suman round the middle, slowing his advance and trying to push him away. He put all his strength behind it and eventually slowed him to a halt\n\n\"_I will save you\" _He yelled\n\nBack on the ground, Lenalee had finally managed to revive the girl and had linked her Golem up to the Black Order in the hope of getting some useful information from her brother. Her entire body trembled as Komui spoke. Each word hit like a physical blow\n\n_\"There is no saving someone once they have entered 'The Fall'… Suman's golem was used to gain information about a large group of Finders and Exorcists- before they all died. He had no reason to ask for this information. We believe he became a double agent… He betrayed the Order Lenalee… He betrayed all of us\"_\n\nThese phrases bounced around her head, echoing horribly.\n\n\"No\" She whispered, tears slipping unchecked down her cheek \"It can't be true\" Every part of her being ached as she remembered the care-free man she had known and what he had now become. How could he have betrayed them all like that? They had been friends- they had done missions together when she was younger and new to the job of being an exorcist. He had protected her whenever she went out with him and had been kind and patient despite her silence. He had teased her every time they met that he had made her what she was- spoke about her like she was some famous pop star and he was the mentor that had brought her to fame. How could he have turned his back on his friends like that? Did he not understand what was at stake? Literally the entire world hung in the balance and yet he had chosen to betray the Order and help the Noah? No. It wasn't possible. She turned in desperation to the village. 'The Fall' hung just beyond the border being held back only by Allen's arm. She could see even from this distance the creature straining away from the grip and Allen's arm trembling. Even he wouldn't be able to hold Suman back forever. She had to evacuate the village and buy Allen some time to get through to him. A pang shot through her stomach; she should be the one up there, she knew him best, but she knew Allen's innocence was better suited to this job than hers and if anyone could reach him, it was him with his endless sympathy and kind heart. Her job meanwhile was to protect the humans in the village and prevent another slaughter. She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from her face then set of determinedly toward the village\n\nAllen's entire body was trembling with the effort of holding Suman in place and he didn't think he would be able to hold it much longer. His arm was burning and his hand was in agony\n\n\"Suman\" He yelled again in desperation as he tried to reach the man who seemed so unreachable\n\n\"You want to live- remember your daughter? Don't you want to live to see her again? Or at least save this world so she can live a safe and happy life? Don't give in to despair so easily- we can win this Suman, we _can_\"\n\nbut there was no response and Suman continued to strain toward the village. Allen had no option- Suman could live without an arm he reasoned to himself. Perhaps if he separated the innocence from him, he would live. Without the innocence attached, surely the synchronisation would cease to matter. Mustering all his strength, he pushed his innocence even further- but rather than respond with its usual surge of energy there was a horrible tearing sound. A shudder ran through Allen's body at the terrible sound. He stared up blankly at his arm, unsure of exactly what had happened but then the pain hit him and all thought was obliterated from his mind. There was a terrible sound ringing through his ears and it took him a few moments to realise that it was his own screams. His arm gave way under the force Suman was pressing against it and contorted into an unnatural angle. With the barrier now removed from him, Suman surged toward the village, the bright lighting bolts of energy sparking. Hardly even thinking about what he was doing, Allen reached into his pocket with his uninjured hand. The pain was tearing through his body but somehow his numbed brain found the spell he was looking for\n\n\"Protegro\" He gasped, pointing his wand at the village and a shield blossomed from his wand- Suman crashed against the shield with tremendous force. It stopped him in his tracks but shattered as the white energy crashed into it. Allen raised his wand again but Suman stopped. Allen hesitated slightly and a small burst of hope blossomed in his chest- maybe something had finally gotten though to him. Suman's cries changed pitch- the body began to crumble and sink slowly to the ground. Allen tried to force his aching body to move but his arm was now sending electric- shock like sensations through his whole body, paralising him. He could see Suman sinking lower and lower, landing with a resounding thud not too far from him. The huge body that he had become seemed to be de-activated or something and Allen could see Suman's tortured face. But he couldn't move. His body just wasn't obeying his lay, frozen, panting heavily shuddering as the waves of pain crashed over his body.\n\nThere was a whirring noise beside his ear and Allen looked up to see Tim speeding over to his masters innate body. Unable to move, Allen watched his approach, feeling incredibly grateful that the had found Tim. Even if he was a little bit irritated that he had left Mai, he knew that he had been a little paranoid in leaving Tim with her and he had certainly not anticipated being away from Hogwarts this long. Tim landed lightly on his masters cheek and patted him lightly. Allen couldn't even muster the strength to respond to this and Tim repeated the action with a little more force. When his master still didn't respond, Tim seemed to lose his temper then bared his fangs and bit hard into his masters ear. Allen yelped and shot upright, the new wave of pain seeming to snap his body out of its paralysis. He staggered to his feet and made his way across to Suman. He collapsed next to his body and lent close to his innate body\n\n\"Suman, I am going to sever your arm ok? And then I'll pull you out but my arm… I won't be able to do it myself- you'll need to bite down on my hand again ok? And I'll pull you out that way\"\n\nSuman's eyes finally opened and met Allen's\n\n\"…Who?…Why?\" He gasped. Allen smiled lightly as he lent forward, fighting though the pain of his arm\n\n\"My name is Allen Walker- I'm going to get you out of this. I promise\". He bit his lip as he willed with all his heart for his arm to hold up through this. He raised it above his head and- holding his good arm out for Suman to bite into- he swept it down, aiming for Suman's innocence. The second his arm began slicing through Suman's innocence, the pain flared up again- amplified exponentially- he was unable to hold back the scream of pain and Suman yelled over Allen's cries\n\n\"Stop this! Leave me! I am not worth this! I betrayed my friends- I killed all those people- Leave me!\" But Allen doggedly battled on, forcing his arm- which was disintegrating as he went- through Suman's arm and with a final burst of effort, he severed the limb from his body. Suman bit down hard on Allen's hand and, barely even feeling this new wave of pain, Allen strained his entire body backwards, slowly pulling Suman out. With a crash, they both tumbled out of the monstrous body and fell to the ground. Allen immediately straitened up\n\n\"Suman?\" He gasped raggedly, clutching his deformed arm to his body, blood trickling through his bent and twisted fingers. He dragged his body through the rubble towards his fallen body\n\n\"Suman!\"\n\nHis eyes are empty\n\nIt's not possible\n\nHe had done everything\n\nHe had given his all\n\nSuman\n\nSuman had to be alive\n\nThere's no spirit\n\nHe's alive\n\nBut his spirit\n\nIt is dead\n\nWhy?\n\nHe fell to the ground with a terrible cry of pain- not physical this time. He refused to believe it- he had the body. If they got him back to Komui- maybe… Maybe. But even as this hope formed in his brain, Suman's body blistered and exploded before his very eyes. Disgustingly bloated purple butterflies poured over Allen's shoulder and a horrible sensation tickled at the back of his neck. Trembling slightly, eyes wide, he turned round and a small gasp escaped his mouth\n\nA tall, immaculately dressed man stood behind him. The man grinned widely as the creatures streamed into his hands\n\n\"Good evening… Shounen\"\n\n**(1)- hehehehe I'm not telling you guys the significance of this- I'll let you figure it out on your own so you can get that little warm feeling of pride that a fangirl/boy gets when they know their fandom well enough to figure things out that other people don't know**\n\n\n\t45. Chapter 45\n\n**A/N Will-of-the-abyss Allen x Road: *Tackle hugs back* Yeah, I kind of dissapeared off the face of the planet for a while there :P I debated for a while about posting this chapter but I can't leave another gap like that again and even if it doesn't have as much plot as i would like, it is something. On a side note- wouldn't the world just be SO much better if drugs were just Lavi. Like lots and lots of chibi tiny adorable Lavi's. It'd give the same high but would be significantly less harmful (though more addictive) I can't believe I forgot to throw in the angsty missing Mai part of the last chapter- I sort of lose track sometimes between what parts I have written in my head and what parts I have written in real life... still, Mai returns here (though it is a rather sad return and is rather short-lived, I just have too much plotting to do to throw in too many adorable father-daughter moments). I also threw in a semi-sweet Dumbledore moment :D. Yeah it is typical of Allen to give Lena his coat while he freezes to death isn't it? The wee adorable numpty. I'm afraid I may possibly end up breaking your heart in this chapter re:Luna... apologies in advance for that :S And Allen didn't listen to your advice, he chose option F. Urgh. Honestly. Some people never learn... **\n\n**Diavo: Yeah, couldn't resist the Laven pun. And its not so much to do with the 14th as it is to do with his innocence... I shall mention once word to help you figure it out and leave it at that... HEART. Kay. Done **\n\n**kickassdani: Thanks :D yeah, this is my first fanfiction so I am kind of learning as I am going. I keep meaning to go back and amalgamate the first few into a decent length chapter. Sounds like too much effort though :P Hope you continue to enjoy the story! **\n\n**Shirubagure: I am just going to say this because it is pretty hard to figure out my own reasoning behind this: The reason Allen is so great at languages is because he has the 14th in him and the 14th is the musician and in my headcanon can use his powers to understand like what things are made of and stuffs as he can (in my brain) understand all languages coz... music... and like building block of language and reasons of things and stuff and I swear the logic made more sense in my head... **\n\n**Ennael: Tyki met Allen in the seedy bar in France hence the reason they knew each other though I am sure I could have explained it better. No, the wand was made by a wizard but was just never matched to a wizard and so was in a dark shelf in Olivanders shop. We skip back to Hogwarts here and so far I haven't really touched on the Noah. Probs wont again till the ark :) coronadomontes: Thaaaaanks **\n\n**guest: Glad you liked it- though I may be about to break your heart in this chapter too**\n\nHarry, Hermione and the Weasles were slumped, exhausted on the disheveled carpet of the living room in 12 Grimmould Place having just finished prising a very stubborn mould from the arms and legs of the ornate but filthy furniture cluttering the room\n\n\"That stuff us absolutely disgusting\" Ron complained as he disposed of a lump of mold that had attached itself to his finger. George and Fred meanwhile poked interestedly through the bag, muttering under their breath to one another before deciding on a few choice specimens and dropping them into a leather pouch which they swiftly stowed under their robes, glancing furvively around. A loud crash coming from downstairs caused all six of them to jump violently. Loud screams from Mrs Black portrait added to the commotion as the adults (who had previously been in the middle of an Order of the Phoenix meeting) burst from their room to investigate. Wordlessly, the entire group of teens scrambled for the staircase, silently running down to the final landing before the corridor that contained the portrait. They halted here and pressed themselves to the wall, just out of sight of the Order. Harry caught a quick glance of Tonks, bent double in the entrance panting before he retreated out of sight\n\n\"What has happened Tonks?\" Mrs Weasly cried, fear apparent in her voice, for as clumsy as Tonks was she would never barge in like that unless something was wrong. Harry strained his ears, on tenderhooks, convinced he was about to finally hear something really useful. There was no way she would be in such a panic if something important hadn't finally happened\n\n\"Someone needs to get Dumbledore _now_\" She gasped \"Ah! Severus! Thank goodness- do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"Of course\" Came the silky, superior tones of Snape and it may have been Harry's imagination but he thought he sounded vaguely concerned.\n\n\"What has happened\" He repeated Mrs Weasly's question, but with some more authority\n\n\"The ministry have found him. The boy. They found Allen\"\n\nHarry's spirits soured, a flame bursting into life in his chest as he turned to grin excitedly at Hermione and Ron. He knew that everyone had been growing increasingly concerned about the lack of contact and he had been unable to stop the unbidden thoughts that had entered his head through his lonely nights at the Dursly's or through the quieter moments at Grimould place. But no, he had been wrong, Allen was fine, he was fine, and even though the ministry had found him Dumbledore would sort that out. He hadn't technically done anything wrong, there was no rule he knew against wizards going on 'holiday' and if the worst came to the worst he thought, feeling rather ashamed of the thought as it came, at least he wouldn't be alone in not returning to Hogwarts if Allen ended up getting expelled too. He had a briefest image of him, Allen and Sirius all living together as a family when Tonks carried on her sentence smashing his vision and his hopes to nothing\n\n\"He is dead, Snape. He is dead\"\n\nIt was as if all the oxygen had been sucked from the world. The clamoring of the Order begging for more detail silenced. The screams of Mrs Black's portrait ceased. There was no sound left in the whole world apart from the thundering of Harry's pulse in his ears. George's mouth was moving but no sound was coming from it. Harry moved in slow motion, turning to look at Hermione and Ron again. Their faces were colourless and both looked like they had just been punched in the stomach. Their eyes met and wordless communication passed between them. Exactly what it was saying, Harry wasn't sure but it helped somehow- this understanding that two other people in the world understood the impossibility of the situation. Allen couldn't be dead.\n\nSlowly, bit by bit, sound entered the world again and time- which had slowed to a snails pace- sped up to its rightful speed once more. There was a loud, strange noise to Harry's left and he turned again to see the noise had come from Ginny. She wasn't crying, but rather just looked like she was in pain. The noise came again and it was as if her lungs were having to force her to breath against her will. Fred, looking rather scared grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her\n\n\"Ginny!\" He yelled and somehow this seemed to snap her back and with a wail, the tears did start. Fred gathered her up in his arms and rocked her as she cried, staring wordlessly over her blazing hair to George. Harry stumbled to his feet and it was as if his body was actually out of his control. He walked steadily down the stairs and across the landing to where the Order were huddled in a semi-circle. Sirius raised his head as Harry approached- his face stricken\n\n\"Harry\" He gasped, holding out a consolatory hand, but Harry's eyes went to Tonks\n\n\"Are you sure\" He croaked, his voice rasping painfully in his throat\n\nTonks blanched\n\n\"Oh Harry! I didn't know you were here! Ah- I only caught the tail end of a conversation- Allen performed magic and Perkins said when the ministry went to pick him up, they found him... well he was... his heart had stopped\" Sirius gripped Harry shoulder and Harry's instinctively grabbed a hold of his hand too, grateful for something to hold onto in the world which all of a sudden made no sense\n\n\"But what happened\" He asked insistently, still staring at Tonks who was looking increasingly uncomfortable\n\n\"I really don't know Harry, Like I said I only caught...\"\n\n\"Where was he?\" Harry interrupted \"Where did they find him? Was he on a mission? Is that why he hadn't contacted anyone?\"\n\nTonks just shook her head. Harry opened his mouth to ask more questions but Sirius's grip tightened on his shoulder, stopping him mid interrogation\n\n\"Harry, don't bite her head off- she doesn't know anything. But we will find out ok? Kingsley will send word as soon as he hears anything and Tonks is about to head back to the ministry right now, aren't you Tonks?\"\n\nHe stared pointedly at Tonks who looked for half a second like she was about to protest but then- after glancing again at Harry- she shut her mouth and just nodded, and retreated back out the door. Sirius steered Harry over to the kitchen and deposited him in a seat, disappearing off and then returning with a steaming mug of mulled mead\n\n\"Just a few sips OK?\" He said sternly, but with a small smile. Sirius left to get the rest of the kids in and Harry took a big gulp of the steaming drink in front of him. The spicy liquid seared its way down his throat and seemed to warm him up from inside, bringing some of the feeling back into his frozen body. Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed in one after another and took up the remaining seats at the table. Harry wordlessly passed the drink around the table and the rest of the teens took a gulp of the searing liquid too. There was absolute silence around the table and Sirius sank into the chair beside Harry, shooting concerned looks at his godson every now and again. Mrs Weasly joined them moments later and- shooting a disapproving glance at the still-steaming mud- she brewed up a pot of tea and handed the cups around the teens, all of whom left them untouched. Moments later, there was a loud bang as the front door flew open and Mrs Black started up her screaming again. Everyone around the table jumped violently and twisted around to stare at the door. There was a pause about as long as a heartbeat and then Tonk's burst through, her magenta hair flying out behind her\n\n\"He's alive\" She gasped\n\n\"He's at St Mungo's. He's alive!\"\n\nThere was a flurry of action as they all surged to their feet and as one ran for the door.\n\n\"_WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE MUST HAVE WONDERED OFF?\" _Mrs Weasly bellowed at a rather pale looking Healer\n\n\"_FIRST YOU TELL US HE IS DEAD, THEN YOU TELL US HE IS MISSING AN ARM AND HAS A HOLE IN HIS HEART THEN YOU _**LOSE** _HIM? WHAT SORT OF A CIRCUS ARE YOU RUNNING HERE?\" _She was actually shaking the Healer now, and he rather looked like he was about to faint. Or cry. Harry turned away from this scene and tugged on Hermione's elbow\n\n\"Come on\" He muttered\n\n\"There's no point hanging around here. Lets go look for him. I'll take the floor below, you take this one, Ron- you go to the floor above\" The two nodded and Fred lent over\n\n\"Me, George and Ginny will cover the other floors\" He said, his face uncharacteristically serious and he hurried off down the corridor. Five minutes later and Harry was wondering along the long, pristine corridors of the 3rd floor- glancing half-heartedly into the ward doors that he passed though it seemed unlikely that a half-dead, armless boy could have wondered in without someone noticing. A horrible though occurred to Harry as he strode down another equally empty wing- what if whatever had attacked Allen had come back for seconds? Whatever it was, it must be incredibly strong- Harry had seen Allen train and had even (an a whim) tried to spar with him once and had been utterly obliterated in mere minutes. He was smiling slightly at this memory when he did a double take. He had given a cursory glance down a darkened corridor that looked unused and had seen something move. He pressed up against the glass in the door and- yes- a shadowy figure was moving at the end. He entered, shaking slightly and strode down to the small figure enveloped in darkness. Harry drew level with the figure that was indeed Allen and his stomach clenched painfully. Although he had been told that Allen was missing an arm, he guessed it hadn't really sunk in because a wave of nausea and horror crashed over his body as he saw the blackened stump that had been Allen's arm. Bandages encased the rest of his body and Harry thought he could see small spots of blood staining the dressings. Allen had his hand pressed against the door at the end of the corridor that clearly had been blocked up at some stage\n\nhis eyes were blank and uncomprehending.\n\n\"Got... to keep walking\" He muttered, and Harry then noticed that he wasn't leaning against the door, he was actually pushing it, which probably explained the blood spots on his bandages. Harry reachedo ut with some trepidation and gently laid his hand on Allen's shoulder. Allen turned to look at him, but his eyes remained unfocussed\n\n\"I... have to...\" He turned back to face the door again and Harry could see his arm trembling as he pushed against the immovable door\n\n\"Allen...\" He started carefully\n\n\"You're in St Mungo's, mate. You're hurt. Look, we really should get back to your room. Come on\" He gently tugged at Allen's sleeve but the boy didn't move. His wide grey eyes met Harry's- his stare was terrifyingly blank\n\n\"St Mungo's?\" He repeated, sounding confused. Harry breathed a sigh of relief- he seemed to be coming back to reality\n\n\"Yeah- you were attacked, Allen and hurt pretty badly, then the ministry turned up and took you here because you performed magic. Don't you remember?\"\n\nThere was a long silence as Allen processed this information, his eyes still rather unfocussed\n\n\"Suman\" He said faintly\n\nHarry blinked- his turn now to be confused\n\n\"He... he didn't mean... had to protect... no choice. The town!\" He gasped, suddenly intense and he gripped Harry's arm\n\n\"The town was it...?\" But his voice trailed off again, his eyes rolled back in his head and his knees buckled beneath him. Harry moved instinctively and caught him before he hit the ground\n\n\"C'mon mate\" He said and wrapped Allen's arm around his neck as the boy came back into consciousness\n\n\"Let's get you back\"\n\nTheir progress was slow and stunted as Allen's legs kept giving way underneath him. Eventually though, they reached the ward, where Mrs Weasly was now gesturing angrily to the head healer of the ward. She paused mid-tirrade and let out a gasp when she saw Harry approach, then ran over to help\n\n\"Oh you poor dear\" She cried as she took Allen from Harry's arms. She gently lowered him to the ground and with a wave of her wand, conjured up a stretcher beneath his body which she then levitated back into his ward- shooting poisonous glares at the healers as she did so. Mrs Weasly gently tucked Allen back into his bed and smoothed the head off his forehead, her expression motherly. She gently squeezed his hand and then retreated to the doorway that the rest of the teens were lurking in. She rested her hand on Harry's shoulder as she walked out\n\n\"Just a few minutes, dears, you don't want to tire him out. We'll go get coffee and wait for you downstairs okay?\"\n\nShe gestured to Fred, George and Ginny as she walked off but Ginny hung back wavering uncertainly- she turned and ran lightly over to Allen's bed, lent down and pressed a kiss onto his forehead, stroking his cheek\n\n\"I'm glad your ok\" She whispered, her fiery hair sweeping over the sheets. Allen gave her a weak smile which she returned quickly before running back after her mother. The smile slipped from his lips as soon as she left and he gave a grimace of pain. Hermione immediately began rummaging through the cupboards and grabbed a bottle of blue potion\n\n\"Here\" She said, concern apparent in her voice as she held the bottle to his lips\n\n\"It'll help with the pain\"\n\nAllen took a sip of the potion and sunk back onto his pillows with a sigh of relief. Harry, Hermione and Ron sat down on either corner of the hospital bed and silence fell over the hospital ward. Hermione rested her hand on top of Allen's and shot a concerned look over to Ron and Harry. Allen was deathly pale and lying there in the bed, he looked so small and young. The harassed looking healer from before re-entered the room and gave a smile of relief when he saw Allen lying in his bed\n\n\"Oh thank goodness\" He gasped\n\n\"You really shouldn't have gotten up at all, your wounds...\" he bustled over to his bed, waving his wand in a complicated motion over him. Nothing visibly happened but it must have told the healer something because he grimaced and began rummaging through the cupboard full of potions\n\n\"Has someone been by to talk to you about what happened?\" He said over his shoulder, in a rather throwaway manner\n\n\"Ah, no...\" Allen said rather nervously.\n\nThere was a loud crash, causing all four of them to jump violently. The healer emerged from the cupboard rubbing his head\n\n\"Oh I am so sorry... I just assumed... Never mind, I know your case well enough... I guess I can just..\"\n\nHe wondered over to the bedside again, arms full of bottles which he dumped unceremoniously on the table\n\n\"Would it be alright if you three stepped out\" He said to the other three, seeming to have gathered himself together, his voice becoming more professional\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione exchanged looks\n\n\"It's ok\" Allen said, sitting up a little bit in his bed- the motion seemed to alert him to the fact that he was missing an arm as he only had one hand to push himself up with\n\n\"Anything you say to me, you can say to them\" he said rather distractedly, staring transfixed at the space where his arm used to be.\n\nThe healer looked rather unconvinced but decided not to push the point\n\n\"OK well... there is still a lot we don't know as we don't really know the circumstances in which you obtained your injuries, however, I will tell you as much as I can. As you can see, you have lost your arm however I don't know if that it is permanent\"\n\nAllen sat forward in his seat, hope blooming in his eyes\n\n\"Your arm- its not exactly- I mean- Whatever the circumstances you lost your arm in, there was absolutely no trauma to your shoulder socket at all nor was there a huge amount of blood loss that we would expect from loss of limb. It's like... it's like your arm disintegrated or something and the stump seemed to seal itself off. The substance- whatever it is, covering your stump, isn't flesh. It sealed the wound off and prevented you from bleeding out. When the ministry officials took you in, you were followed by a sort of dusty material that matches the substance on the stump of your arm- it is a bit like you're arm disintegrated and then followed you here. I don't know. I've never seen anything like this before but it is theoretically possible that it could... reattach? Though it would have to reassemble itself into the proper shape- I will refer you on to some magical experts who...\"\n\nAllen slumped back on the pillow and heaved a sigh of relief- he wasn't completely useless after all, there was still a chance that he could re-join the battle. He was so full of relief that he almost missed what the healer said next\n\n\"...hole through your heart\"\n\n\"_What?\" _Allen said in shock. The healer gave a start of surprise\n\n\"Didn't you know? Ah... When we found you, you had a hole strait through your heart and had gone into full cardiac arrest- hence the reason you were reported dead at the scene however, the hole then sealed itself and your heart restarted. We really can't explain it. There were no external injuries, just the hole.\"\n\nHe shrugged and shook his head, clearly completely nonplussed he was smiling slightly though and it was pretty obvious that he found all of this completely fascinating- medical mysteries obviously being his thing\n\n\"Most of your other injuries were relatively minor though\" He said, snapping out of his trance\n\n\"Apart from the injury to your right arm\" He frowned as he said this\n\n\"The wounds were really quite severe- but the injury- err- it looked like- well, a human bite mark. Which obviously is completely...\"\n\nBut before he could complete the sentence, Allen said\n\n\"Yeah, that was Suman\"\n\nThere was a long, heavy silence as the Healer gaped at him in shock\n\n\"You broke about 20 bones in your hand! And the bite mark was almost all the way through- who...?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about it\" Allen said unconcernedly\n\n\"He didn't really mean to hurt me- I told him to do it- look it's a really long story, but he wasn't intending to hurt me, honestly\"\n\nHe smiled serenely at the group surrounding him, all of whom were staring in absolute horror at him\n\nThe three teens opened their mouths to ask further questions but the healer seemed to come to his senses (for the third time)\n\n\"OK! Well, I think we should leave it there, don't you? Now, the ministry are going to expect a full statement from you but I will fob them off for now. You need to get some sleep\"\n\nThe Healer measured up a couple different potions into a vial and handed it to Allen.\n\n\"This should help you sleep, and it'll promote healing. I'll be back to check on you in an hour or so\" He stowed the bottles back into the cupboard and gestured to the rest of them to get out\n\n\"Nah, we'll wait for a while\" Ron said tersely, staring down at his friend\n\n\"We won't keep him awake or anything. We just want to sit with him a while\"\n\nThe Healer nodded understandingly and bustled out of the room, leaving them alone\n\nThey sat there for a while, watching their friend as he slept, slowly coming round to the fact that yes, he was still alive but that he was unlikely to ever be the same again\n\nThe next time Allen woke, it was to find Dumbledore sitting on a plush seat at the side of his bed, half way through 'Tales of Beedle the Baard' pausing every few lines to make little annotations. He glanced up and smiled when he saw Allen had finally woken up\n\n\"Ah, it is so good to see you my dear boy\" he said enthusiastically\n\n\"I was really beginning to get rather concerned with your lack of contact. I'm glad you are here more-or-less in one piece\" He chuckled slightly at his own joke and Allen was so surprised at the black humor that he laughed too\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" Dumbledore asked, handing over a breakfast tray and pouring out a cup of tea for himself. Allen heaped bacon onto his plate, all of a sudden realising that he was absolutely starving\n\n\"I'm doing ok I guess\" He said shoving a few mouthfulls of his meal into his mouth\n\nDumbledore quirked an eyebrow and gave him a look that clearly said he didn't believe a word of it\n\n\"Alright, maybe I'm not OK, but there isn't really much I can do about it is there?\"\n\nDumbledore interlocked his fingers and pressed the tips to his lips\n\n\"Well, I suppose not. Though talking can help\"\n\nHe leant forward, his sky blue eyes serious\n\n\"I need to know what happened\" He said softly\n\n\"Take your time- there is no rush but I _need _to know. I only got in here before the ministry did because that healer of yours seems to have taken a liking to you. Once I know exactly what happened, I'll be better able to help you\"\n\nAllen nodded and slowly began telling his tale, pausing only to eat more food, or gulp down mouthfuls of tea. Dumbledore said nothing, merely nodding every now and again or pointing his wand at the tray of breakfast foods and replenishing the supply. Once Allen had finished, Dumbledore sank back in his seat, eyes unfocussed and far away as he processed all the new information.\n\n\"Well\" He said eventually\n\n\"The ministry will probably charge you for unauthorised magic, however the chance that the cahrge'll stick to you are even slimmer than the chance they'll stick anything on Harry. I mean, you were found half-dead in a nearly destroyed town- they simply cannot ignore _that _much evidence, no matter how much they may want to. Now, obviously, they will not believe you when you tell them the truth but that doesn't really matter. We need to get your story out there so when they question you, I want you to tell them what really happened alright?\" Allen nodded and shrugged\n\n\"I don't really care what they say about me, Professor. I have more important things to do now anyways\" He glanced wryly at his missing arm and Dumbledore smiled\n\n\"Yes, I suppose you do\" His tone grew a little more serious\n\n\"About that actually... Things are proceeding much faster than Cross and I anticipated- it may not be possible any longer for you to stay at Hogwarts till you come of age\"\n\nAllen said nothing- having come to this conclusion himself almost as soon as he had regained consciousness\n\n\"Obviously you will have to stay till you manage to sort out whatever is going on with your arm and regain your strength but I am under no illusions as to exactly what you will do as soon as you are able to fight again\"\n\nDumbledore smiled rather sadly as he surveyed Allen\n\n\"It is truly a sad day when we must send our children to fight for us\" he mused remorsefully, his face clouding over. Allen avoided his gaze not willing to get into it- he really didn't care how sorry Dumbledore felt for him and his situation- pity would do him no good. He just had to get back to where he belonged. With Lavi and Lenalee and the others, fighting the Noah.\n\n\"Where is Mai?\" He asked, not even trying to disguise his attempt to change the topic of conversation. Dumbledore chuckled again\n\n\"Alright, I get the message- I'll bring her in tomorrow, once you are feeling a little better, but back to business- just for a minute I promise- I believe I may have found a way to help us with this whole Trace situation\"\n\nAllen sat forward in his bed, all of a sudden very intent on everything Dumbledore was saying- if there was some way to get around the Trace, he would maybe be able to rejoin the battle even without the use of his arm. Sure he wouldn't be quite as effective and he wouldn't be able to save any Akuma but he could definitely help the other accommodators. Dumbledore noticed the light igiting in Allen's eyes and sighed internally. It was painfully obvious what was going through the boys head and Dumbledore was pretty certain he didn't like it\n\n\"I found a clause\" He continued still displeased with the effect that his words were having\n\n\"Its an ancient rule but it is possible for a wizard to be released from the trace before they turn 17- you see, in the old times, the wizards fought many battles against other magical races and so there had to be a get-out clause for young wizards to bolster the ranks for battle. I will need to draw up the contract and it will take a little time but once we get signatures from a teacher from every subject you have taken in school on the document declaring that you are safe to perform that branch of magic, then one signature from me and one from a ministry official (Kingsley I believe is our best shot) and you should be free to go. Though I _absolutely _refuse to draw up this document until you are capable of rejoining battle again- No Allen, that is final\" He said firmly as Allen began to protest\n\n\"Now, I had better go. I have some things I need to attend to. I'll be back tomorrow\" and with that, he stood up to leave, waving his wand and causing his chair to disappear\n\n\"You may re-join your friends at Grimmauld place as soon as you are released from here- I have had words with Sirius and he is more than willing to have you and Mai- Mrs Weasly said she was happy to help and look after her while you recuperate. Good evening\"\n\nAnd with that, he swept from the ward, robes billowing in his wake\n\nAllen slowly woke from the deep sleep the Healers potions had put him in to a smell he couldn't quite place, but that made him feel deeply contented. His brain sluggishly tried to place the smell. Talcum powder... violets and sweets. He smiled slightly, it smelt kind of like Mai but of course it couldn't be because he was in the middle of nowhere in that stupid beat-up truck. Just as that thought occurred to him, he realised that he was oddly comfortable and that couldn't be right because he hadn't had one comfortable nights sleep in that scrap heap of a car. Now that he thought about it actually, he remembered that he wasn't in the truck because they had got on the boat but he wasn't on the boat either because the boat didn't have comfortable beds either. Slowly, like the sand trickling from an hour glass, the memory came back to him and with a great effort, he opened his eyes. The light blinded him initially and it took a good few minutes for him to adjust to its brightness, once they did however, a balloon of joy inflated inside of his stomach because at the foot of his bed, coloring in a picture with crayons was Mai. Unable to even form words, Allen just reached out his hand for her. Mai glanced up from her picture and a huge smile lit up her face\n\n\"Jibo!\" She cried joyfully and scrambled her way up the bed to throw her small arms around his neck. Allen grinned too, his throat still chocked up, completely unable to form words. He buried his face into the back of her neck and breathed in her scent, his heart feeling too big for his chest.\n\n\"Hey princess\" He croaked once his voice eventually returned to his body\n\n\"Papa missed you so much you know that?\"\n\nHe released her and planted a kiss on the center of her forehead, causing her to giggle\n\n\"I missed you too papa\" She said, she sat back on the bed and began petting his head\n\n\"You're all hurt\" She stated, matter of factly and Allen smiled wryly\n\n\"Yeah, I guess I am\" He laughed\n\n\"I'll make you all better\" She stated again in a matter of fact tone, fussing around him in a rather mothering way. She tucked the blankets tightly around him, planted a kiss on her forehead and handed him the glass of water from his bedside table before resuming stroking his hair\n\n\"This will make you all better\" She said\n\n\"You used to do that to me when I was sick and it made me feel better\" She watched him expectantly. Playing to the part, Allen smiled brightly\n\n\"Wow, that is really working! I feel loads better. Thanks Mai\"\n\nA giant grin made its way across her face\n\n\"Are you coming home today then?\" She asked \"Dumbledore took me to another house and its all dirty and I miss you and you were away for aaaages\"\n\nAllen's joy at seeing Mai eventually began to fade under the weight of his exhaustion and he was actually rather relieved when Dumbledore returned to take her away. He felt terrible because he had missed her so much while he was away but every muscle in his body ached- even his chest was starting to hurt- reminding him that it was not-at-all amused that he had gotten it punctured mere days ago. He could barely raise his head when the healer- Allen had finally found out his name was Roufa came through the door. He clucked and fussed about the state that Allen was in a tinkered around the room enthusing about how adorable Mai was Allen barely took any of this chatter in but was rather grateful for the background noise it provided and the fact that he was not required to respond to any of it. Roufa straitened the pillow underneath his head and sat down on the side of the bed\n\n\"I'm sorry that we need to do this but I held the ministry off as long as I could. They want to talk to you now and I'm afraid I cant keep them at bay much longer\" He watched Allen rather nervously but he just nodded wearily\n\n\"Knew they'de be here soon\" He sighed\n\n\"It's ok. I'll be ok\" He winced as he pushed himself back up the bed and a pain shot through his chest. Roufa ran back over to the bedside and helped the boy sit up properly\n\n\"When can I get home\" Allen sighed, thinking of Mai and Harry and all the rest of his friends waiting for him and all of a sudden the ache inside of him that had been there since he found out he wouldn't be able to fight eased slightly, the nagging, insistent voice telling him that he had to get back, he had to get back, he had to get back and save them. Save them all before it was too late- quietened slightly and another voice started up, wondering what Grimmould place was like, how his friends were and what the next year at Hogwarts was going to hold. It didn't exactly drown out the other voice but at least it wasn't the only thing going through his head any more which also helped with his whole clinging onto sanity thing. The ward door was suddenly flung open and Allen was shocked to see the minister stride in, Percy Weasly trotting in his wake. Behind him, a toady looking woman, a middle-aged woman with a monocle of all things and about 3 other very disgruntled looking wizards filed in, each conjuring up a chair with a flick of their wands and sitting down, staring stoney-faced at Allen. Cornelius, the monocle lady and the toad faced lady sat closer to Allen, the rest of the wizards keeping their chairs at the wall, watching over the proceedings.\n\n\"Mr. Allen Walker- charged with the multiple counts of underaged magic in the presence of an entire town of muggles\" He glanced up over the parchment at Allen, his eyes narrowed in dislike. Allen smiled at him serenely, taking pleasure in the irritation that flickered over the ministers face\n\n\"He performedHow do you plead to this charge?\" He snapped.\n\nHarry wondered through the house a small ball of discontent growing in his stomach, feeling pretty frustrated with his whole situation. He paused at the end of one of the corridors, having heard a strange noise. He cocked his head to one side and followed the sound all the way over to the room Sirius had given to Allen. He entered the room and found the source of the rhythmic 'thuds'- Allen was sitting on the floor at the foot of his bed throwing a ball against the floor, to bounce on the wall, to land back in his hand before beginning again. He glanced up when Harry entered the room before returning his gaze blankly to the wall but something about the way he shifted his body let Harry know he was welcome in. He closed the door behind himself and sank down opposite Allen. Allen changed the trajectory of the ball slightly and Harry caught it before bouncing it back. They kept this up for a while before Harry broke the silence\n\n\"Ron's prefect\" He said, throwing the ball a little harder than he meant- Allen only just caught it and threw it back, a vaguely amused expression on his face\n\n\"Okay\" He said \"Are you jealous?\" His tone was completely non-judgemental yet Harry couldn't help but feel ridiculously childish\n\n\"I don't think so\" He said slowly and they fell silent for a while \"It was just, I don't know, a little unexpected I guess...\" His voice trailed off and he went back to passing the ball. There was an even longer silence before, the rhythm of the ball oddly soothing. Eventually, Harry spoke again, his voice quieter than before\n\n\"I keep on having nightmares... dreaming about the graveyard, you know?\" He muttered, catching the ball and fiddling with it instead of passing it back\n\nAllen dropped his hand to his side and kept silent, allowing Harry to speak\n\n\"I see Cedric\" He said, staring pointedly at the ball he was playing with \"My mum... my dad standing between me and Voldemort\"\n\n\"Your parents?\" Allen asked curiously\n\n\"Oh yeah, I didn't tell you that part\" Harry said, having forgotten to tell Allen about what had gone on in the graveyard while he was away fighting that Akuma thing. He explained as best he could the priori incantatium spell and told Allen about his parents, about what they had said and about how Cedric had asked him to take his body back to his parents. Allen mulled this piece of information over\n\n\"I'm sorry\" He said eventually\n\n\"That must have been really difficult for you\"\n\nHarry nodded silently and threw the ball back to Allen who caught it deftly. They passed it back and forth for a while before Allen spoke\n\n\"I feel useless\" He said in a low voice. Harry frowned in confusion and opened his mouth to ask a question but Allen spoke before he could\n\n\"I know I can't fight like this, I know I can't rejoin the war unless my arm miraculously decides to re-attatch itself to my stump but I _want_ to go back. My friends are out there, fighting to pick up the slack I have left- people are out there dying because I am here- souls are waiting for me to release them and I am sitting here, doing nothing. And I know there is nothing anyone can do about it but I am so bitter and so angry that I feel the anger is following me around, seeping into everything and everyone. It's like... it's like I am poisonous\"\n\nHarry couldn't help but identify with what Allen was saying, he had felt that way a lot about his black moods- this then explained at least partially why they had seen so little of Allen. Though to be perfectly fair, he was well within his rights to be a little depressed, considering all that had happened to him. Harry had heard that Allen's hearing for performing magic out of school had been a few days ago. The adults had been trying to play it down, figuring that the less attention that was on him, the better, all things considered. There had been a lot less tension about his case too compared to the way it had been with Harry mainly because there was absolutely no way that the ministry could have pinned anything on him and everyone knew that the main reason they were even holding the court session was to make a splashy headline. They had already gone to town on his trial\n\n\"_Headmasters Adoptive Son Found in Middle of Carnage\" _It had been the usual rubbish and had- naturally- not gone into any detail but instead just said that Allen had been found in a almost completely destroyed town half way across the world. It had decided not to mention that he had been found half dead or you know- that it hadn't been him that destroyed the town. Allen however was less concerned about this than the others seemed to be- and just shrugged it off saying philosophically\n\n\"They will find out eventually\" before resuming playing poker with Mai. He had been ignoring Mrs Weasly's complaints that he was 'teaching her bad habits' and carried on with his new mission to teach her how to count the cards so that when she got all grown up, she would be able to beat everyone she came across in a card game. He reasoned that it was both a good way to teach her maths and a good way to keep her out of mischief. She hadn't been kidding about this creepy house and he was concerned that if he let her out of his sight she would get snatched by one of the hundreds of terrifying monsters that were lurking around every corner. Besides, poker was a perfectly acceptable past time. Healthy even. Yeah. He was an incredibly responsible father\n\n/_skip to Hoggy-warty hogwarts/_\n\nAllen craned his head over the crowds of people milling around the Hogwarts Express, searching for the blonde head of Luna's. Eventually, he spotted it and slid his way through the staring students\n\n\"Hey\" He grinned as he caught up to her, tapping her arm. She turned around, and as her dreamy eyes focussed on him, a broad smile bloomed on her face\n\n\"Oh, hello there Allen. It's good to see you\"\n\nHe smiled nostalgically, having missed her odd way of talking\n\n\"It's good to see you too Luna\" He said warmly\n\n\"Sorry I've not really... been in contact with you over the Summer. Things have been a little, hectic\"\n\nUnderstatement of the century he thought wryly. Luna however seemed unperturbed by his radio silence over the past 3 months or so\n\n\"I was traveling with my dad- we were looking for the Crumple-horned snorkack so I haven't really been receiving any owls lately. In fact\" She gazed rather dreamily into the distance \"I don't think anyone from school has ever sent me an owl before\" She continued to stare disconcertingly blankly at the space just to the left of Allen's head\n\n\"Ah... right...\" He said uncertainly, rather wrong footed now\n\n\"We only got back two days ago\" She continued dreamily\n\nThat sort of explained why she hadn't asked him about his summer- though he was rather surprised she hadn't noticed his disappearing from school two weeks early and the lack of contact prior to her hunting trip. Still, the lack of questions wasn't really bothering him that much. Everyone else was staring at him, muttering, pointing at his missing arm, sniggering unashamedly but Luna- she was just as she always was. Half a light-year away, tuning in to the mundane world only when something that interested her occurred\n\n\"So how did the hunting trip go?\" He asked and happily boarded the train listening to her talk his ear off about the totally-real Crumple-horned Snorkack. They eventually found an empty compartment, grateful for the lack of staring students. Allen slumped in the corner and began reading sections of the Quibbler which never ceased to amuse him. The rhythmic thud-thud of the train on the tracks lulled him into a trance like state and he dozed off onto Luna's shoulder. He woke horribly after being hit in the face with some mysterious thick liquid. He flailed around with shock and fell off the seat with a thud, spluttering in shock, he spat out a globule of a thick pussy substance\n\n\"What the?\" He stared around the compartment uncomprehendingly to see everyone else equally plastered with the stinking goo and Neville clutching a Mimbulus Mimbletonia with a look of remorse on his face.\n\n\"_Neville!\" _He yelled irritably\n\n\"I am so sorry Allen\" He moaned, reaching out a hand to the boy\n\n\"I swear I didn't mean it!\"\n\nAllen gripped the proffered hand and grunted in pain as he was hauled to his feet, but he couldn't help smiling as he looked around at their predicament and then laughing (silently) When Harry's crush (He thought the kids name was Chang or Cher or something) walked in on them, still covered in the gloopy substance. Hermione then helpfully siphoned it off them. She sat down next to Allen and smiled over at him and Luna\n\n\"You'll be glad to see Allen again after so long. You must have been worried sick\" She smiled sympathetically at the girl. Luna gazed at her in mild confusion\n\n\"Well\" Herione continued pointedly, matching Luna's confusion\n\n\"You know- it must have been hard for you knowing that he was out there fighting and that he... got hurt and...\" Her voice trailed off slightly as Luna continued to look rather confused\n\n\"I'm not really sure what you mean\" She said simply\n\nHermione made an odd little strangled noise in the back of her throat as she struggled to find some way to reason with Luna\n\n\"Don't you kno-\"\n\n\"It's fine Hermione, drop it\" Allen said quietly. Hermione looked scandalised but Ron took up the role of peacekeeper and changed the subject, telling them all about Malfoy being the Slytherin prefect. The nugget of knowledge had barely left her lips before the smug little snot banged the compartment door wide open\n\n\"What\" Harry snarled as soon as he saw the little snobs face\n\n\"Manners Potter, or I'll give you a detention\" He drawled back\n\n\"You see, I, unlike you have been made a prefect, which means that I unlike you have the power to hand out punishments\"\n\n\"Yeah\" Harry retorted \"But you, unlike me, are a git. So get out and leave us alone. Allen laughed appreciatively and this drew Malfoy's attention, he cooly raised an eyebrow\n\n\"Tell me Potter, do you pick your friends solely based on the fact that their lameness exceeds even your own? I mean come on- you've got Weasly- the descendent of what truly must be the most pathetic wizarding family in history, then you have Longbottom who is without a doubt the thickest wizard in history, Loony- I don't even know _where_ to begin with that\" He gestured disparagingly at Luna, whose multicolored specterspecs were flashing psychedelically in the light\n\n\"Then there is that little mudblood\" He jerked his head to Hermione, his sneer becoming even more pronounced. Ron bristled but Malfoy plowed on looking increasingly self-satisfied at the reactions he was causing\n\n\"and finally, to top it all off, you've got a delusional amputee who believes in the monsters under his bed all following you around like the faithful little _doggies _that they are. I mean come on, I guess even you look sane in comparison to that. Ah-ah-ah\" he said patronisingly, raising a consolatory hand out as he backed out of the door- Harry, Ron, Allen and Hermione had all surged to their feet as one. Ron and Harry already had their wands raised and both Hermione and Allen looked like they were ready to do the same\n\nLaughing superiorly he slammed the door hard, causing the glass pane to rattle in its frame\n\n\"You know\" Allen said through gritted teeth\n\n\"I really am starting to dislike that guy\"\n\nHe dropped back into his seat and glanced up at Harry- who's face told him that yes, he had caught Malfoy's choice of words and had drawn the same conclusion as he and Hermione had. Malfoy knew about Sirius.\n\nThe steady drizzle soaked through their robes, chilling them all to the bone as they stepped from the warm comfort of the Hogwarts express to the rain-soaked station. Allen watched sympathetically as the first years filed off despondently after Professor Grubbly-Plank to the Great Lake where the row boats were awaiting them\n\n\"I do not envy them\" He said following Ron and Harry to the carriages that waited for them\n\n\"There's not enough seats for all of us\" Hermione said firmly as they approached\n\n\"Allen and I will go in this one. See you guys at the castle\" She gripped Allen hard by the elbow and steered him in the direction of another carriage, leaving Harry staring rather oddly at the creepy black horses that drew the rickety contraptions and Luna looking rather surprised by Hermione's actions. Allen however knew exactly what she was doing and why and was not at all impressed. He didn't say anything and let the heavy silence settle around them as they took their seats. He was _not_ going to initiate this conversation\n\n\"Allen\" Hermione began and his heart sunk strait to his boots\n\n\"Does Luna know what happened over the Summer?\" She sounded rather teacher like Allen mused but he couldn't avoid her now that he was cornered\n\n\"No\" He said quietly avoiding her eyes pointedly\n\n\"_Allen!\" _She cried in exasperation\n\n\"How could you not tell her? More to the point, why hasn't she asked? You are missing a limb for crying out loud- what, has she just not noticed?\" Hermione's bushy hair seemed to expand with her indignation and she put her hand on her hips, glaring at Allen who was still staring pointedly out the window at the rain streaming down the windows\n\n\"What does it matter if she knows\" He said finally\n\n\"I mean, she knows I fight Akuma and so she probably has figured out that I lost my arm fighting them. What does it matter if she doesn't know the exact circumstances behind it all?\"\n\n\"Allen\" Hermione said, sounding slightly more sympathetic this time\n\n\"You can't just not talk about this stuff- you saw people die, you saw people you knew die and get hurt. You have been hurt yourself and you are still hurting. It's not fair to you or to her to pretend that none of this happened. I mean, you aren't the same person now that you were before the holiday, you know that and we both know that you are planning on rejoining the battle\" Her voice wobbled slightly at this and Allen tore his gaze rather unwillingly from the window to look at his friend, a few tears had trickled down her cheek but she just swiped them away irritably\n\n\"Allen, where do you see this relationship going, if you are planning on leaving the wizarding world for the black order?\" Then in a slightly nervous voice she continued on\n\n\"Do you think... maybe... you are trying to return to the 'Allen' that you were before the battle- before all this happened to you and that by not telling her and not facing up to the conversation you are going to have to have with her you will somehow be able to go back to the time when things were so much simpler because, I am really sorry, but that really isn't possible. You have seen too much and been through to much and Luna- well- she isn't going to understand. Not until you explain to her anyway\"\n\nAllen smiled and nodded\n\n\"I know\" He stated simply\n\n\"I know things can't go back to the way they were. I'll talk to her, soon. I promise\"\n\nHermione got up from her seat and joined Allen at the other side of the compartment, putting her arm around his shoulders\n\n\"I'm ok\" He said earnestly, smiling at her\n\n\"Honestly, I'm fine\"\n\n\"I know you are\" Hermione said, hugging him gently\n\n\"I know you are.\"\n\nPrecisely two days later, Allen took Luna down to the Great Lake, to the spot that they had been on the first time he had really noticed her, when she had bandaged up his eye and talked to him as if he was a normal human being and not some circus freak with a black arm and cursed mark. He told her about the battle, about all the villagers that had died, about the handful he had helped save. He told her about Kanda and Lavi and Lenalee then he told her about Suman and about that fateful day that he had lost his arm. She listened, oddly attentively as he told her about Tyki and that healer Roufa hoped his arm would be able to rematerialise and that as soon as it did, he would be leaving Hogwarts and it was unlikely that he would return. He decided not to add that the reason he was unlikely to return was because he would probably die on this kamikaze mission and instead phrased it to suggest that he would just be too busy to come back. He watched sadly as the usual glow that surrounded Luna faded and her serene smile disappeared. With a horribly heavy heart, he broke up with her and his heart almost broke in his chest when she smiled and asked simply if he wouldn't mind still being her friend. Mutely, he nodded and her smile grew brighter and she lent in to embrace him gently, whispering quietly to him\n\n'_everything is going to be OK' _and he thought he actually felt his heart break inside his chest.\n\nAllen sighed as he fiddled with his eagle feather quill. He had finished '_Defensive Magical Theory'_ twice and had come to the conclusion that it was complete and utter bull. For someone who spent most of his life out fighting the monsters of the world, reading a book denouncing everything but the theoretical was more than just dull, it was a little insulting. He watched in vague amusement as Hermione- for the first time in her life- began causing a ruckus in the class. His face grew more serious however when Harry stood up and began retorting to Umbridge's snide remarks\n\n\"But this isn't going to prepare us for what is _out there_\" He snarled\n\n\"There is nothing out there\" Umbridge sneered, effectively getting a raise out of Harry, who was unable to restrain himself from retorting. Allen watched the two argue back and forth for a moment before he was unable to contain himself too\n\n\"Tell me, professor, do you think that Cedric killed himself?\" He asked, his voice as calm and collected as he could make it, despite the fury building up inside of him\n\n\"Or do you think that all those people dying at the same time in Little Hangleton was just some freak, coincidental accident? The entire town was torched- there were bullet holes and craters everywhere yet the best you ministry can come up with is a _terrorist attack. _Tell me, exactly how much do you actually know about muggles and what is going on in their world because I can tell you now, they own nothing that would do that kind of damage and they certainly haven't mastered the skill of disappearing into thin air yet. You are refusing to see- refusing to face the facts and I can tell you now, you will regret that stubbornness when the Akuma finally come out of hiding and attack.\"\n\nHe was trembling slightly with rage now, his voice grew terse and strained. He glared up at Umbridge who looked smirked\n\n\"Now\" She said softly\n\n\"Shall we look at what _you _say happened?\" She gave a little simpering cough and her tone became incredulous\n\n\"Now _your _claim is that an army of... ah... what did you call them? Oh _yes_. An army of _akuma_ descended upon the town and destroyed it. And for some reason, you are the only person who knows that these creatures exist. They are certainly not in any government database, but I suppose we are to just take your word for it are we? You, who mysteriously disappeared from the last week of school while all this was happening. Without permission I may add...\" She raised her eyebrow at this stage and paused rather pointedly before continuing\n\n\"Now we don't know exactly what happened in that tragic accident, however what we _do _know is that it wasn't some make-believe monster-under-your-bed or some dark lord brought back to life but instead was a very disturbed person. Now. I will have no more discussion of this in my class. It is not relevant to the subject that I am teaching and I am not giving you two boys a platform to spread your filthy little lies\"\n\nShe turned sharply on her heel and strode back to her desk, sitting down primly and picking up a few papers, disappearing behind them, firmly ignoring the two boys.\n\n\"They are _not lies!\" _Harry shouted, unable to contain himself\n\n\"Come here, mister Potter, mister Walker\" Professor Umridge said in her sugery sweetest tone\n\nHarry kicked his chair aside and strode up to her desk, Allen following in his wake. They stood in silence by her desk as she scribbled something down on a pink memo. She handed it to Harry, completely ignoring Allen\n\n\"Go see your head of house. Both of you\" She intoned, her voice dangerously quiet. They both turned sharply and strode out of the room.\n\nUmbrige leered over the top of her pile of marking papers at the two boys in front of her- Both sat with their heads down, in absolute silence, neither letting a single wince of pain reach their face. Allen was writing in spiky letters\n\n\"I must learn my place\"\n\nHe payed no heed to the marks that were forming and re-sealing on his hand, but rather concentrated on the letters- one stroke down for the 'I' sharp angles on the 'M' He followed the pattern again and again till Umbrige finally called for them to stop and took them up to her desk. She smirked at the two boys and gestured for them to reach out their hands. After inspecting them carefully she said delicately\n\n\"Well, that didn't seem to make much of an impression. Tomorow night then? We shall try again- see if we have can't... make the message sink in a little _deeper. _You may go\" She gestured them out of the room and returned her gaze to the papers she was marking as if nothing of importance had happened. Allen and Harry turned on their heels and strode from the room without so much as a backward glance\n\nThey repeated the same pattern for each detention, neither of them saying anything other than 'good morning' and 'good night' as they entered and left\n\nAround the 4th detention, Allen turned to the shot a glance over at Harry. A crease had formed between his eyebrows and he was frowning subconsciously at his sheet of paper- Allen could tell that he was angry about missing his quidditch match and, glancing up to the marking table, he could tell Dolores had noticed too as she was looking even more self-satisfied than she normally did and that was saying something. He returned his gaze to his own paper and frowned irritably at the back of his hand. It was bleeding properly now and the cuts were only partially healing. He supposed this was because he only had the one hand to use so the wounds weren't being allowed to heal properly. Staring at his hand, he felt a sudden swelling of rage and protectiveness bloom inside him. The feelings were so strong, he stopped writing and had to consciously stop himself from vaulting over his desk and grabbing Umbridge by the throat. His hands were trembling with rage and he clenched them tightly, taking a deep breath in and blowing it out slowly. The rage slowly left his body, leaving only a small ember of anger burning in the pit of his stomach. He was surprised at himself really, he was usually so proficient at containing his anger he never really got carried away with his emotions. It almost felt like the rage had been someone else's. He wasn't even all that sure what had triggered the surge of emotions. Before he could work it out, a noise interrupted his thought process\n\n\"Mr Walker dear, you are here to do detention- to be punished. Not to stare off into the distance. Unless of course, you are willing to repent of your lies? Your hand must be hurting you. All you have to do is stop spreading your malicious lies and you will no longer need to be punished\" She gave a simpering smile, clearly enjoying this immensely. Allen lost his temper at this- he had finally had enough of her. He replied to her leer with a cool, polite smile\n\n\"Do you really think that our convictions are so weak that we will repent of them just because you make us suffer a little pain? You clearly don't have any real convictions yourself or you would understand that this method of yours is going to have no effect at all. That is, unless you _do _understand that and just enjoy causing people pain\"\n\nHe shrugged one shoulder and cocked his head on one side, pinning Umbrige with his gaze. Harry's quill stopped scratching too and he looked over at Allen half surprised and half curious. Umbriges eyes didn't leave Allen's as she said in her most sugary tone\n\n\"Mr Potter, please leave\"\n\nHarry made no move to go\n\n\"_Now\" _She snapped, slightly less sweetly.\n\nHarry ignored her and instead turned to Allen. Allen hesitated for the briefest of moments then nodded shortly to Harry. Umbridges smile had disappeared and her beady eyes followed Harry as he swept up his things and left the room, shooting a concerned look over his shoulder. Once Harry had exited the room, Umbrige he hopped off her seat (Allen held back a smile at the toad like action) and waddled her way over to Allen's desk. Her gaze was hard and furious\n\n\"Look, you little brat\" she hissed in a surprisingly venomous tone\n\n\"You may wish to watch your step around me- in case you haven't noticed, your sole protector is slowly losing his power to protect you and soon you will be completely at the mercy of the ministry and I and let me tell you _boy\"_ Her tone became even more scathing as she looked him up and down\n\n\"I will be informing the ministry as to _what_ you are and what you are up to and you can be sure, none of them will be tripping over themselves to help you\"\n\nHer wide mouth stretched into a disgusting leer as she stared down at Allen\n\n\"Pray tell me\" He said his tone icy\n\n\"Exactly _what_ do you think I am\" He had caught her emphasis of the word and wasn't really sure what she had meant but was sure that whatever it was, it wasn't good. Umbrige looked down her nose at him superiorly\n\n\"Goodness only knows what your mother bred with to produce you\" She spat\n\n\"All I know is that whatever you are, you are most definitely not human- tell me, how many humans can remove their arms at will? Or create and seal a hole in their hearts?\"\n\nAn icy chill swept over Allen as fury- definitely his own this time- coursed through his body\n\n\"I didn't remove my own arm\" He said jerkily, trying to control himself\n\n\"Or pierce my own heart. I have already told you what happened to me- why on earth would I have done something like that to myself?\"\n\nUmbrige let out a tinkling laugh that sent shudders up Allen's spine\n\n\"Oh don't play so innocent, _half-breed. _Don't think I don't know what is going on. You are trying to cause panic amongst the wizarding world. Spreading these baseless stories about wars and destruction and monsters. You are trying to weaken us and scare us and get us to declare war on a non-existant enemy. Or better yet, on the Japanese ministry of magic, oh yes, you would like that very much wouldn't you? And you have used your freakish ability to try and make us think that you were attacked by some... some mythical creature!\" Her face was twisted and spittle flew from her mouth as she shouted these accusations at Allen, a strange glint lighting up her eyes\n\n\"Well, you are not fooling me, _freak _nor are you fooling anyone else at the ministry. We know what you are up to and we will stop you. It is only a matter of time before Dumbledore is removed from his station and once he is...\" Her smile grew even wider and a self-satisfied glint lit up her eyes.\n\nAllen bent down and picked up his schoolbag, slung it over his shoulder and strode out of the room, Umbridges words of\n\n\"See you tomorrow\" ringing in his ears\n\nAllen slumped against a tree, sweat trickling down the side of his face as he watched Firenze cautiously. The centaur had backed off and was breathing heavily too, his sword hand dropped by his side wearily- Allen bumped into Firenze in the middle of the forest while he was sparring with an unfortunate tree- trying to force his arm to re-materialise. Firenze had found him and after hearing his plight had agreed to help out though he seemed now to be regretting his decision somewhat\n\n\"Maybe we should take a...\" Firenze began in his low voice but before he even completed his sentence, Allen shook his head and pushed himself upright again, wiping his forehead with his hand.\n\n\"Lets go\" He said shortly and took up a fighting stance again. Firenze shook his head, his expression concerned but before he could protest again, Allen charged. Firenze raised his sword and blocked a kick from Allen then took a swipe at the boys side. There was a dull clunk as Allen's arm momentarily materialised and stopped the blades motion. They were both so shocked that they stopped fighting. Firenze grinned widely but Allen just took up the fighting stance again. Firenze began to protest but Bane then stepped out of the shadows and took the sword from him\n\n\"Stop going easy on the foal Firenze- he won't grew stronger if you don't push him\" He growled moodily\n\nAllen twitched irritably at the word 'foal' but said nothing, just grateful that Bane had actually decided to help out- his initial reaction to finding out that Firenze was helping Allen had been less than pleasent. Bane swung the sword in a sweeping motion, testing its weight before he charged at Allen looking scarily serious about the attack. Allen's eyes widened and he twisted out of the way, ducking under the blade and bringing his fists, clenched together down on Bane's back with all his strength. Bane almost fell to the ground then spun around, eyes narrowed to slits\n\n\"I am so sorry\" Allen gasped, hands clapped over his mouth\n\n\"I- you just surprised me and I- it was a total accident I swear\" but Bane just laughed\n\n\"You are strong, boy. But are you strong enough?\" And he charged again, sword held high.\n\nThey eventually called it to an end a few hours later after Allen threw up rather violently behind one of the bushes. Even though he very quickly raised his fist again- Bane decided that he'd done enough and- when Allen tried to protest, gave him a glare so stern that Allen quailed underneath it. Finally admitting defeat, he made his way back through the forest now struggling to find his way through the thick undergrowth- partially due to his exhaustion and partially die to the fact that it was now pitch black. He slowly dragged his weary body back to the castle functioning solely on auto-pilot. He had made his way up the first few flights of stairs before he really realised how late it was- curfew was 10 at the weekends and the corridors were utterly deserted. Feeling slightly more nervous, he forced himself to move more quickly. His body felt heavy, as if it weighed twice what it should and his brain was moving at a snails pace which was why he didn't notice Umbridge till her stubby little fingers enclosed around his arm.\n\nMcGonagall looked oddly normal dressed in her tartan dressing gown though the icy glare she was now giving Allen was seriously deducting any mumsy-points given her by the homey outfit.\n\n\"You know the rules better than anyone Walker, having hung out with those rule-breaking friends long enough. You usually know better though what on _earth _were you doing out at that time?\"\n\n\"hem hem\" Umbridge coughed pointedly. McGonagall nostrils flared and a vein began pulsing in her forehead\n\n\"What\" She snarled irritably\n\n\"Oh\" She simpered girlishly \"I was just wondering exactly what you are expecting to achieve by asking _why_ Mr Walker here broke the riles. Surely all that matters is that he did break them?\"\n\nAllen snorted quietly- it figured that her mind would work that way\n\nMcGonagall's head turned sharply to him and she narrowed her eyes, clearly having heard him\n\n\"Yes it does matter, Dolores\" She said tersely\n\n\"If I know _why_ he did it, I can figure out what punishment to give him\"\n\nAllen's smile disappeared at this\n\n\"Well, I think I know exactly what punishment to give him Minerva, so I can save you the trouble\"\n\nMcGonagall's face became even more frosty\n\n\"I am his head of his house\" She snapped\n\n\"And I am the one who is responsible for punishing students in my house\"\n\n\"Ah well\" Umbridge drew out, a very self-satisfied look in her eyes\n\n\"I think you will find that I now have control over punishing any students I see fit to\"\n\nShe drew a sheet of paper out of her pocket and proceeded to wave it around in a very superior manner\n\n\"And I believe that... shall we say... 2 months of detentions with me in the evening should convince him that wondering around the school after hours is unwise\"\n\nA stunned silence followed these words. No one ever got handed that much detention for minor rule breaking. In fact , no one got that much detention for major rule breaking.\n\n\"Well. That aught to do the trick. Goodnight Minerva. I shall see you tomorrow Mr. Walker. 5pm. Sharp\"\n\nAnd with that, she waddled from the room, slamming the door behind her with a loud bang.\n\nAllen turned to stare at McGonagall in horror. She looked rather ruffled but scowled at the look he was giving her\n\n\"Oh for goodness sake, wipe that puppy dog look off your face. It's your own fault. getting caught by Dolores of all people wondering around at eleven o'clock, I _ask_ you\" she flicked a finger to the door. Allen got to his feet, exhaustion hitting him all over again, like a sledgehammer. He was halfway to the door when McGonagall spoke again\n\n\"Mr. Walker, be careful, alright? Umbridge is gaining more power by the day and she already has her eye on you. Don't go giving her any more excuses to get you alone. You may go.\"\n\nAllen barely restrained himself from rolling his eyes irritably (as if he wanted to be spending all this time slicing his own hand open over and over again) and exited the room, already thinking of his warm, comfy bed, trying not to think of all the staircases that stood between him and sleep or to think about the endless set of afternoons he was now obliged to spend with that toad of a woman who he was pretty sure now wanted to get rid of him by any means necessary. That was a problem for future Allen. That guy could deal with that. Currently the only thing Present Allen could be bothered worrying about was whether or not he would be able to maintain consciousness long enough to reach his bed before passing out.\n\nHogwarts really was beginning to suck he thought moodily as he finally made it to his fore poster bed and flopped face down on the covers\n\nYou knew things were bad when you were beginning to look back on the days you spent crammed in the back of a dusty, rickety army truck with nostalgia.\n\nStill.\n\nHis arm had materialised for the first time and despite his utter exhaustion, he smiled.\n\nHe was going back.\n\nHis sleep was deep and dreamless until at about 4 in the morning, something seemed to switch the light on in his sleeping brain. He was waste deep in a thick black lake, the liquid holding him solidly in place as he stared across crumbling ruins half submerged in the liquid. He saw Lenalee slumped across one of the lumps of crumbling brickwork. She was dead, her eyes wide and blank. A huge big moon hung low in the sky and leered scarily down at him. Allen stared up at the sky and the words '_Half-breed' _Began scrawling themselves across the storm clouds, bleeding thick, red blood. Allen gasped in pain and grabbed his throbbing hand. The pain built and built to a searing level. Allen bent low at the waste, squeezing his eyes tight against the pain when all of a sudden, a hand touched his shoulder. The pain disappeared instantly and when he opened his eyes, it was too see the glassy water reflecting an azure blue sky with white fluffy clouds. Someone extended a hand into his field of vision to help him up. Raising his eyes, Allen saw Lavi who was grinning cheerily down at him. Smiling in relief, Allen accepted the hand and let Lavi pull him to his feet so they were both standing on the glassy surface of the lake. Allen tried to say thank you but no words came out. Lavi just smiled wider, seeming to understand anyway. He tugged on Allen's hand and let him across the lake to a grassy verge. Allen's eyes widened as he saw Lenalee, lounging at the edge of the lake, her feet dipped into its surface, she turned from Kanda who was sitting cross legged across from her and she waved cheerily to Allen who smiled in return. She was alive. that was good. Lavi led him on over the hill and to a solid wall of hedge. They stopped suddenly at this and Allen craned his head back to see where it ended, but the hedge seemed to extend on forever. He reached out his hand to touch it, however as soon as he layed a hand on the leaves, they melted from his touch and a smooth marble arch formed. Allen started forward and Lavi dropped his hand\n\n\"Go on\" He said, speaking for the first time\n\n\"I can't go in there\"\n\nAllen felt slightly disappointed but walked through anyway. He turned to look back at Lavi but everything beyond the arch had disappeared into inky blackness. This didn't disturb him however and he just continued forward, stepping into a grassy clearing. An enormous table stretched out in front of him and he could see a shadowy figure seated at the end. Curious, he walked forward, his body feeling like it was moving through syrup. He walked for what felt like forever but slowly, slowly, came closer to the figure. He was about 10 meters away from the dark silhouette when something stirred in his memory\n\n'_Mana?\" _he wondered vaguely and stepped forward again with more excitement but something enclosed around his waste stopping him. He looked down blankly at his waste- white bandages were wrapped around his midriff. Following them with his eyes, he turned to see a blazingly white figure standing behind him. He was so bright it dazzled his eyes and he couldn't make out any features\n\n\"That is not Mana\" The figure said gently, a silver mask flashing in the light\n\n'_Who is it?' _Allen wondered silently\n\n\"Stay here\" The figure said, his voice slightly more commanding now\n\n'_But I can't' _Allen stated silently again _'I have to talk to him. He is the host of this party. It would be rude not to talk to him'_ Somehow this was perfectly clear to him and he knew, even though it felt rather dangerous, he knew he had to talk to this mysterious figure. The bandages tightened slightly around his waste\n\n\"Stay here\" The white figure implored and Allen was almost swayed, the voice was so gentle and the figures arms looked so inviting, outstretched to him pleadingly but something else tugged at his heart. He had to see the man.\n\n'_I am sorry' _He thought sincerely\n\n'_I'll just be a minute'_\n\n_\"_You'll wake him\" The figure said, a slight note of panic in his voice\n\n\"Then there will be nothing I can do to save you\"\n\nAllen turned to the figure and the urge to speak to him flooded his heart again\n\n\"_I'll be quick. I promise\" _And regretfully but firmly, he pulled against the bandages which released him, zooming back to the white figure, rejoining the fabric of his white coat. The figure retreated slightly but Allen could feel the reproachful stare bore into the back of his neck as he approached the dark man at the head of the table. His steps grew slower and slower as he approached, a feeling of trepidation and dread filling him up as he neared him. But he had to. He stretched out his hand. He had to.\n\nHis finger tips brushed the shoulder of the man. Nothing happened for a second then all of a sudden, a huge rush of emotions blasted through Allen's body\n\nRage\n\nThe same protective rage that had filled his body in Umbridges office\n\nAnger... righteous anger then...\n\nPain. Terrible pain and loss then...\n\nSorrow.\n\nSuch sorrow\n\nIt tore him up from inside and he fell to the ground under the weight of it as the dark figure rose\n\nSorrow\n\nAllen woke with a gasp, the duvet falling off his body, soaked with sweat. He gasped and panted as his heart thundered in his chest. He raised a hand to his cheek. He was crying. But even as he wiped the tears from his cheek, the memory of the dream began to slip from his mind like sand through his fingers and even as he tried to recall why he felt so shaken, the details eluded him. Exhaustion hit him again and he slumped back onto his pillows, falling into a light and fitful sleep.\n\n\n\t46. Chapter 46\n\nI'm really sorry by the way for the formatting. I promise it wasn't on purpose. My computer has begun to screw up royally recently and I'm not really sure what went wrong. It had paragraphs when i posted it. Promise. To make it up, I threw in another paragraph (properly separated this time at the end) Sorry again :/ \n\n\n\t47. Chapter 47\n\n**A/N HEEEEY GUUUUUYS! What's up!? Oh... you are wondering where I have been? *sweatdrops***\n\n***Falls prostrate of the floor sobbbing* I AM SO SORRY! I HAD STUFFS AND THINGS AND I AM TERRIBLE AT TIME MANAGEMENT PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!**\n\n**hopefully the next one wont take so long to go up?**\n\n**XD Love ya all I promise**\n\n\"Morning!\" Harry chirped a warm glow burning inside his stomach- Cho had spoken to him! And he hadn't made a _complete_ fool out of himself. The image of her smiling at him, her eyes sparkling, her hair perfect seemed to be burned into his retina and the helium balloon it had inflated in his stomach his stomach hadn't deflated even slightly\n\n\"What are you so pleased about?\" Ron grunted, still bleary eyed and looking like he hadn't slept all night\n\n\"Ahh... quidditch later\" Harry lied, smiling widely as he slid in beside Ron and piled food onto his plate, feeling all of a sudden ravenous\n\n\"Listen\" Ron said rather conspiratorially \"Wanna go down a bit early, just so I can you know, warm up a bit before practice?\"\n\nHarry nodded enthusiastically, noting the concerned look on his friend face and silently hoping that his friend was going to be better than he thought he was going to be. He wasn't exactly sure how he would deal with it if Ron was kicked of the team but there was no point in worrying about it just yet.\n\n\"Look, I don't think you should\" Hermione interjected\n\n\"You both have a lot of homework to do\"\n\nAllen gave a rather animalistic growl from beside her\n\n\"Do _not_ mention that word in my presence Hermione\" He scowled, brandishing the piece of parchment he was currently scribbling on rather more violently than was perhaps necessary.\n\n\"This essay for McGonagle is killing me and I still have Potions... and Ancient Ruins. And detentions with Toadfessor Umbridge\" His eyes widened as he realised what he had just said \"Professor! I mean Professor!\" he cried over Ron's raucous guffaws. Allen buried his face in his hands\n\n\"It's not my fault\" He groaned\n\n\"I've spent all my detentions calling her that in my head in silent payback. It makes me feel better. Though now I am beginning to worry I'll accidentally call her that to her face\"\n\n\"Oh please do!\" Ron begged, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes\n\n\"I know she'd probably behead you and all but man that would be so funny\"\n\nHermione pursed her lips in disapproval as Harry and Ron both tried to make their own spin-off's of Umbridge's name- including classics such as 'Bum-bridge' and 'loath-essor' she muttered 'childish' under her breath and impatiently pushed Allen's arm aside to make way for the tawny owl that was bearing her copy of the Daily Prophet. The Owl hopped impatiently on one leg and flapped his wings frantically in an attempt to keep his balance as Hermione untied the newspaper. Its wings clipped the edges of both Hermione and Allen's head as it flew off. Allen shovelled a forkful of sausages in his mouth and lent across to read the front page over her shoulder. Hermione gave him a rather poisonous look and shuffled around in his seat a little so he couldn't read it causing Harry and Ron to erupt into laughter again. Harry had just passed his Transfiguration essay over to Allen who began alternately copying and editing sections when Hermione let out a gasp\n\n\"Look at this\" She flattened the paper out on the table and pointed to one of the headlines\n\n\"Sirius!\" Harry, Ron and Allen immediately surged forward and seized the paper which promptly tore down the middle\n\n\"So Lucius _did _see him then\" Allen said grimly as he read the passage.\n\n\"What?\" Ron said looking alarmed\n\n\"Didn't you catch it? Malfoy- when he got on the train... he mentioned something about 'dog' and we just sort of guessed, you know, seeing as the Death Eaters know he is an animagus now\"\n\nHarry read on through the rest of the article rather glumly\n\n\"Hey guys\" He said \"Look\"\n\nHe pointed to a small section at the bottom of one of the pages\n\n\"Stirgus Podmore\" Ron read slowly\n\n\"Hey... isn't he...\"  \n>\"Shut up Ron\" Hermione snapped quickly before he could complete the sentence. They conspired for a while, leaning close so they couldn't be overheard before Ron and Harry left for the Quiddich pitch looking rather guilty as they scurried out of the Great Hall under the baleful gaze of Hermione. Allen sniggered and added concluding sentences to his and Harry's essays before scooping the rest of his books back into his bag along with an entire bread basket of rolls<p>\n\n\"What!\" He said defensively at Hermione's look\n\n\"Brain food! I need it!\"\n\nHermione shook her head, smiling despite herself\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"Hang on half a sec and I'll come join you. I need to finish the translation for Professor Victor too\" She grabbed her bag too and joined him as he rather dejectedly sloped off to the library.<p>\n\nLater on that evening, Allen was sat in the middle of the common room, locked in a furious Jenga battle with Mai, trying to ignore the arguing between Ron and Hermione. He paid a bit more attention however, when a letter from Percy arrived for Ron. His expression became increasingly incredulous as Ron read the letter out loud- that kid seriously was the most patronising, pretentious idiot to ever exist. He gathered Mai up in his arms at 9 o'clock and was relieved to see that Ron and Hermione were making nice again. Seriously, it would go an awful lot easier for the both of them if they would just admit that they liked each other but neither seemed likely to do that any time soon.\n\n\"You know Mai, guys can be real idiots sometimes\" He sighed staring seriously at the sleepy little girl.\n\n\"I'd stay away from them if I were you\" he frowned sternly\n\n\"I'm only 5 Daddy! I don't have a boyfriend\" Mai giggled\n\n\" 'Sides, my friend told me boys have cooties\" She wrinkled her nose cutely at this idea and stuck her tongue out in disgust. Allen laughed and kissed the top of her head\n\n\"I pity any guy that tries to date you Mai, seeing as they will have Hagrid, Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and the Twins to get through before they can get close to you\" He gently teased her a little longer about dating and read her a short story before putting her into bed. He waved goodnight to Madame Pomfrey before exiting the Hospital wing and making his way back up to the common room, hoping that by now Ron and Hermione would have sorted everything out. He was relieved to see when he returned that they were being civil to each other again, and Hermione was even helping Ron out with his Astronomy homework which was a good thing too considering the little he had seen of the essay. The day Ron had made friends with Hermione had been a good day indeed for his grades Allen thought wryly as he curled up cat-like in one of the armchairs near the fire and started to fill out Ron and Harry's dream diaries\n\n\"What are you doing those for\" Hermione demanded, staring in outrage at the dream diaries like they had personally offended her\n\n\"They're hardly taxing and you've got plenty homework on your plate as it is\" She shot rather reproachful looks to Ron and Harry\n\n\"We didn't make him!\" Ron protested defensively\n\n\"He asked to do them\"\n\nAllen grinned rather sheepishly over the top of the parchment\n\n\"I did Hermione, they are really fun to do- you can make up the weirdest stuff and I can't do it myself any more as I dropped the subject. I wish our other homework was this fun. I mean look at this one- for reference Ron, on Friday, you dreamt that you flew on a green Hippogriff to a marshmallow mountain where you had a picnic on the back of an Elephant with a civilised, Persian Troll\" Ron snorted with laughter\n\n\"Cheers mate! Hey, what're you doing Harry?\"\n\nHarry had fallen to his knees on the common room floor and was staring intently at the flames in the fireplace\n\n\"It's Sirius\" He said calmly, pointing at the fire where- indeed- Sirius' head was sitting amongst the flames, looking mildly amused at the expression of shock and disbelief on Ron, Hermione and- Allen's face\n\n\"Good to see you Harry! I was beginning to worry that you'd go to bed before the common room emptied\"\n\nAllen frowned at this\n\n\"Have you been popping in and out of the fire to check and see if the room was empty Sirius? What if someone had seen you?\"\n\nSirius rolled his eyes irritably at Allen \"Whatever. It was fine wasn't it? I'm sure you'd have heard by now if any one had spotted me. Has any one told you that you are 15 going on 40? Right old party pooper. I needed to come anyway. There was some stuff in that letter you sent me Harry that it just wouldn't be safe to answer by post\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Allen smarted slightly at Sirius' snappish retort and recommenced filling in the dream diaries, absent mindedly as he tuned in and out of their conversation. Sirius offered some pretty useful information and seemed to have no qualms about telling them everything he knew which was a refreshing change from most of the adults Allen had dealt with. He was made to feel slightly better when Sirius told them about Umbridge's political career- at least he wasn't the only person she had ever persecuted. She seemed rather vindictive against everyone that wasn't within her strict definition of what was acceptable- a definition which seemed to be restricted to pure blood wizards as far as he could tell. Everything was going fine until Harry shot down Sirius's idea to come to the next Hogsmede trip- he seemed to take greater offence at Harry reprimanding him for being reckless than Allen and he very quickly made up some half- arsed excuse and disappeared from the fire with a 'pop'<p>\n\nHarry re-joined Allen in detentions mere days later after exploding in Umbridge's class (again). Having both boys in detention again seemed to spur Umbridge's vindictive mood on as she kept both boys there till midnight. Hermione and Ron waited up loyally however Allen was beginning to wish they hadn't- not that it wasn't a nice gesture, or that the murtlap essence wasn't helping but both seemed intent on forcing Harry and Allen to tell one of the teachers about the detentions. Harry seemed to be rather stand-offish about telling Dumbledore and Allen wondered silently if something had happened between the two. Harry really did sound rather bitter\n\n\"But I'm sure he would _want _to know\" Hermione insisted\n\n\"Look we can't tell him\" Allen said exasperatedly\n\n\"Or anyone for that matter. I don't think you really grasp this Hermione, there is nothing any one can do to stop her- she has the entire ministry of magic behind her. If we told a teacher of course they would try to stop her but all that would happen is that they would be fired or a new decree would come out and she would know that she had managed to get to us. We aren't going to go whining to the adults. Its not as if its really all that painful anyway, its just a matter of endurance and we will outlast her\"\n\nHermione looked for a moment like she would like to press the matter but Ron thankfully chipped in\n\n\"Just drop it, Hermione\"\n\nShe mercifully took his advice but then started off on another tangent- Allen saw within second where she was heading with it- it took Harry a little longer to catch up but when he did...\n\n\"Not a chance Hermione! Are you mental? Me? A teacher?\"\n\nHermione and Ron preceded- very unwisely in Allen's opinion- to turn up the sarcasm and push every. Single. One of his buttons and sure enough...\n\n\"LISTEN TO ME!\" Harry bellowed. He really was getting rather more adept at controlling his temper Allen thought as he raised his hand out of the murtlap essence and inspected the slightly less red skin. He was not going to intervene he decided in this rant. Ron and Hermione really needed to listen to what Harry was saying. Sometimes he did wonder if they really realised the effect all these near-death encounters had on their friend. Granted they had been there for a lot of them, but in most cases, had been absent at the worst stages and they had not been there for his nightmarish experience last Summer. They needed to understand the full extent of what he had been though and though being shouted at was not necessarily the most pleasant way to hear this, it was still important. Eventually things settled down slightly and Harry agreed to think about their proposals. The two slightly shame-faced teens disappeared off into their dorms leaving Allen and Harry in the common room by themselves\n\n\"Reparo\" Harry muttered, jabbing his wand at the bowl he had smashed and looking rather miserably at the spilt Murtlap essence\n\n\"Here\" Allen said kindly and pored half his bowl into Harry's. Harry accepted this with a grunt of thanks and sunk his hand back into the bowl, staring despondently into the glowing embers in the fireplace\n\n\"What do you think?\" He muttered eventually\n\n\"What?\" Allen said rather lightly \"About how much your life sucks or about you teaching?\" Harry smiled despite himself\n\n\"About me teaching, smart ass\" Allen smirked\n\n\"I think you know as well as I do that it is a good idea. Plus, it'll give you a channel for all that angst you are carrying around about Umbridge. Maybe prevent you from biting her head off in the middle of class again and irritating her so much that she keeps detention going till midnight\" He stared rather sternly at Harry who chuckled\n\n\"You may laugh\" Allen said in a mock-angry tone \"But I am rather fond of my only remaining hand and I'd rather not carve the words 'I must learn my place' strait through it, if its all the same to you that is\" Harry stuck his tongue out at his friend and yawned widely\n\n\"You may have a point\" he said, wiping the oily essence off his hand and wrapping it in a bandage\n\n\"I'm too tired and irritated to think about it anyway. Off to bed I think\"\n\nAllen awkwardly wiped the murtlap essence off his hand using the side of his bowl too and frowned at the bandage Hermione had left for him\n\n\"Oi, wait up there mate\" He said, catching Harry by the sleeve of his robe as he walked past\n\n\"Give me a hand\" He said, then sniggered rather childishly at the pathetic joke\n\n\"Quite literally I mean, I can't put the bandage on with one hand. Man I need my bed\" He groaned. Harry laughed and obliged.\n\n\"You really need to get this whole missing-arm-thing sorted out\" He said as he tied the bandage in a neat little bow\n\n\"Oh _really\" _Allen said, his voice dripping in sarcasm\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"Wish I'd had <em>that <em>idea earlier on! Would have made my life sooooo much easier\" \"All right!\" Harry said mock- defensively raising up his hands \"It was just a suggestion...\" He laughed as he dodged a swipe from Allen and ran lightly up the staircase to his awaiting four-poster bed with Allen hot on his heels\n\nAllen dug his ancient ruins textbook out of his bag and unstoppered a new bottle of midnight blue ink awkwardly with his teeth. He spat the cork out and dipped his quill in, taking a second to appreciate the smell of new parchment and ink. He had no more than put quill to parchment before Fred and George appeared out of nowhere\n\n\"What's up bud?\" George said loudly, shattering the peace and quiet of the common room and causing Allen blot the pristine scroll.\n\n\"We have a proposition for you\" Fred chipped in, popping up on Allen's other side, ignoring the scandalised look he was giving them\n\n\"Yeah\" George chipped in\n\n\"We hear you are rather adept at potion making and we were looking to expand Weasly Wizard Wheezes so we are honoured to offer you a position as chief potions-maker!\"\n\nBoth twins grinned identically at Allen with puppy dog like excitement. Allen considered them for a moment, assessing whether or not they were serious\n\n\"When you say expanding, you mean employing more people than yourselves and Lee right?\" Allen smirked\n\n\"Hey!\" George protested \"You can't bad mouth your own company like that! You'd better watch or I'll dock your pay\" Fred nodded emphatically, backing his twin up\n\n\"I get paid?\" Allen asked excitedly\n\n\"Ah. Well. Not so much, but you _do _get the honour of knowing that your work will go towards the destroying- Umbridge effort and lets be honest, that is all the payment you need\"\n\nAllen considered this for some time, with both twins giving their very best plaintive looks\n\n\"All right, fine\" He said eventually \"But I absolutely refuse to take part in any first-year-testing. Not that I don't think there isn't enough for a few to go missing here and there, but Hermione is scary and she'd have my head if she caught me\"\n\n\"Understandable demands\" Fred said seriously\n\n\"Now, as a first task... exactly how much do you know about getting rid of painful purple pustules?\"\n\nThe twins led Allen up to their dorm where they seemed to have reconstructed their four poster beds into a lab. A sheet hung from the corner of one poster bed to the other, cordoning off the corner of the dorm. Allen and the Twins ducked through the drapes, relieving an impressive set up. Crooked shelves climbed the height of the walls stacked with tattered books, an assortment of dusty, barely-clinging-on-to-life plants and a myriad of glass bottles and vials. Some of these contained oddly coloured liquids and others, animal parts, suspended in preservative liquid.\n\n\"Don't your room mates mind you guys doing experiments in here?\" Allen asked as he inspected the impressive collection of ingredients the twins had amassed\n\n\"Nah... they stopped complaining\" Fred said, grinning rather creepily. Allen looked appraisingly at them and decided not to pursue that line of inquiry any further. He knew how devious the twins could get and as pranking went, they operated on a whole other plane from everyone else\n\n\"Oookay... now lets see these pustules\"\n\n\"Not a chance\" The twins chorused, backing away from him nervously\n\n\"They are not in a place we frequently display to the public\" George said darkly and Allen suddenly noticed that neither had sat down since they entered the dorm room and both were looking very uncomfortable. He added two and two, coming to a quick conclusion as to the exact location of these pustules. Trying not to laugh, he set up their small cauldron and began poking through some of their ingredients\n\n\"That's fine, there are some things I don't need to see. Could you at least tell me what you took that caused this?\"\n\nFred nodded and rummaged through a pile of parchment that was being held in place by a mug of Butterbeer\n\n\"Here\" He said, handing a rumpled scrap of paper over to Allen, then sniffed the top of the flagon before shrugging and downing the contents\n\n\"We were testing a new recipe for our 'Skiving Snackboxes' and something went a bit wrong\"\n\nAllen accepted the piece of paper and poured over the scrawling writing intently. Fred and George shuffled about impatiently, both looking incredibly uncomfortable\n\n\"Right\" Allen said slowly\n\n\"I think I see the problem here- purple pustules you said right?\" Fred nodded in conformation\n\n\"Okay- well see here, you used Knotweed and Rattlesnake skin in the same potion- it can cause boils and suchlike things. Hang on- you don't have any murtlap essence here do you? Hermione has some if you don't...\" He rummaged through the glass bottles muttering under his breath\n\n\"Ah here!\" He said triumphantly pulling one of the bottles out\n\n\"You shouldn't need much\" The twins gabbled their thanks and snatched the bottle from him, running off to the bathroom. They emerged moments later with a much more relaxed demeanour to find Allen sitting cross-legged on the wooden floor making a few alterations to their recipe, using his knee as a table. He raised his head as the two entered the little lab again and grinned\n\n\"Better?\" The twins nodded emphatically\n\n\"I really missed sitting down\" George said dramatically, wiggling his bum around on the floor with a ridiculous, blissful expression on his face. Fred and Allen laughed\n\n\"What are you up to now, my new favourite human being in the whole wide world?\" Fred asked curiously\n\n\"Oh, making a few alterations to your recipe\" Allen said absently, scoring 'rattlesnake skin' out of their recipe and adding 'powdered crow's claw' in its place\n\n\"Here, lets give this a go\" He prodded his wand at the base of the cauldron and soon had a little procession line going, with the twins preparing the ingredients as he tended to the potion. Fred and George followed his orders obediently and an hour or so later, a pale purple potion was bubbling away merrily between them\n\n\"That should be it\" Allen said, putting the flame out and waving his wand over the potion. It bubbled and thickened as he did so, turning a slightly deeper shade of purple. They poured the glutinous product into a tray and with a wave of George's wand, the substance solidified. Allen scribbled a few calculations down on a sheet of parchment before carefully measuring out a 3cm by 1cm rectangle\n\n\"That should be the correct dosage\" He said, with a little less confidence in his voice than perhaps you would like. He examined the sweet momentarily, then shrugged and popped it into his mouth, wrinkling his nose in disgust before swallowing\n\n\"We'll have to see if we can do something about the flavour\" He noted and George scribbled something down on his clipboard. Both the twins stared expectantly at Allen who blinked owlishly beneath their gaze\n\n\"Maybe the dose wasn't...\" But he hadn't even finished the sentence before blood began trickling out of his nose\n\n\"Oh good\" Fred said in relief, making a note on George's clipboard\n\n\"Though we may increase the dosage slightly, to make the effect a little more dramatic. Hang on, that looks like a lot of blood\"\n\nAllen had raised his gloved hand to wipe away the trickle and his previously white glove was soaked in blood\n\n\"Oh shoot\" Allen said thickly through the nosebleed\n\n\"I forgot. The anticoagulation effect- it must be the cut on my hand. Could you give me a hand guys, take the glove off. Its my hand that all the blood is coming from, not my nose\"\n\nGeorge looked at Allen in confusion but Fred just did what he said, pulling the glove off and untying the bandage wrapped around his hand. Sure enough, the cuts underneath were bleeding rather heavily and George turned a rather delicate shade of green\n\n\"Grab the yellow bottle there- yeah the stuff that looks like oil\" Allen said patiently, hoping that the twins weren't going to faint on him as that would be terribly inconvenient. Thankfully however, they seemed to pull themselves together. Fred obediently unstopped the little bottle and pored the contents onto Allen's hand, his own hands shaking slightly as he did so. The twins watched with baited breath, concern apparent on their face as the blood slowed to a trickle, then stopped. All three boys heaved a sigh of relief\n\n\"I might need to change a couple things there\" Allen said faintly slumping back against the bed\n\n\"Maybe dial down the vampire bat venom _juuust_ a little\" He frowned in mild irritation at the sheet of parchment which was now spotted with scarlet droplets of blood, obscuring some of the instructions.\n\n\"Where did you get that cut from?\" George asked seriously as he wiped the extra blood off Allen's hand, revealing the message 'I must learn my place'- Allen grimaced internally. He had not intended on letting either twins in on that secret\n\n\"Oh _that _cut... \" He said rather dismissively \"yeah, that's a souvenir from Umbridge's new and exciting twist on writing lines- get this, you write lines but instead of writing it in ink, you write it in your own blood. Cool huh!\" He grinned widely but Fred and George looked utterly appalled despite his jovial tone\n\n\"You have _got _to be kidding me\" George said, aghast\n\n\"That is illegal in so many different ways\"\n\n\"Ah but you are forgetting, my dear friend, she is from the ministry. The organisation that _writes _the laws\" Allen pointed out, waving his wand at his glove, returning it to its pristine white colour before pulling it back on his hand with his teeth in an attempt to stop the twins from gaping at the scar\n\n\"It's really not that big of a deal. I can deal with a little pain. Besides, kicking up a fuss wouldn't help anything, it'd only increase her smugness level and I think if her ego inflates any further, she will smother everyone in the school. No. Indirect rebellion is the best way to go I think so yes, I believe I will take you up on your job offer. Lets give her as much hassle as we can\"\n\nThe twins cracked identical evil grins\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"Sounds like a plan to me\" They chimed<p>\n\nOver the next few weeks, the twins room-mates got used to seeing Allen wonder in and out of the dorm. Lee had assimilated to Allen's presence quickly and seemed to greatly appreciate the significant reduction in negative side-effects from their tests since Allen began proof-reading the twin's experiments and altered them when needed. Allen was in the middle of researching the theory behind attaching enchantments to inanimate objects when Fred entered the lab, holding a basket full of assorted fruits, sugars and chocolates\n\n\"Figured if we want to shift any of our product, we need to make it edible\" He threw over his shoulder at Allen as he dumped the stuff in the middle of the floor. Allen crawled over to the wicker basket which no doubt had been obtained from the schools good-natured house elves. They seemed to have a bit of a soft spot for the twins and had even (on occasion) subtly dropped hints as to the exact times Snape would be out of school. They of course said nothing further, and any liberties the twins would take of Snape's supply cupboard during this time was nothing to do with them and was completely coincidental. Allen began poking through the contents, scrutinising them carefully\n\n\"Hm. Yeah, some of these might work. I could get the essence of the flavour out and then the acidity wouldn't mess with the potion\" He excitedly, grabbed a handful of blackberries and placed them in a silver dish. He enthusiastically seized one of his textbooks and began rifling through it. Fred looked on in amusement as Allen pored over one page titled 'Dehydration spells' then a mischievous smirk spread over his face\n\n\"Here\" He said innocently, handing Allen a mug of tea and a plate of custard creams. Allen mumbled his thanks an absent-mindedly began picking at the biscuits as he noted down a few of the spells. He had just found a chapter on isolating the separate components of an object when he paused and frowned slightly.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Fred asked, rather hopefully. Allen continued frowning at his hand in some confusion\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"I don't really know\" He said slowly \"I feel a little...\" Here was a loud 'pop' and Allen disappeared, to be replaced by a bright yellow canary.<p>\n\nGeorge heaved his backpack higher on his shoulder, feeling unduly nervous. There were no teachers around, and it was very unlikely that any of the students were going to snitch on him however he couldn't help but feel rather on edge, with a backpack full of potion ingredients stolen from Snape's cupboard and Professor Sprouts Herbology garden. He entered his dorm with some relief, but did a double take as his twins raucous laughter rang out. He curiously entered the lab to find Fred rolling around on the ground laughing uncontrollably. He was seriously considered the thought that his other half had slipped from their usual mad-scientist mentality into full blown insanity when he noticed a tiny one- winged canary tweeting madly at his brothers feet. He bit back a laugh as he pieced together what had happened. Kneeling down on the floor, he held out one had, into which the tiny bird hopped, chirruping rather dolefully\n\n\"Fred\" He said reproachfully as he cradled the small bird in his palm\n\n\"Did you trick Allen into taking the canary creams? You know we aren't supposed to prank the weaker pranksters. They are like little babies, you have to teach the about the cold, hard world of pranking slowly and with kindness!\"\n\nFred paused his raucous laughter with difficulty and gasped out\n\n\"It was just too good an opportunity to miss!\" before breaking down again, clutching his ribs\n\nGeorge shook his head disapprovingly at his twin and sat down in the opposite corner of their tent fort, gently stroking the shivering bird with with his little finger. After roughly twenty minutes, he held Allen up and scrutinised him closely, gently prodding him\n\n\"When will this wear off\" He said curiously as Allen chirruped impatiently, stretching his wing out and pecking at it irritably.\n\nFred shrugged absently as he flicked lazily through one of the books lying at his feet\n\n\"Dunno. Half an hour maybe. It was my first attempt at the spell and I haven't tested it till now. Seems to have worked rather well, though in retrospect, I may change it so that they turn you into a human sized canary... too dangerous when they are small\"\n\nHe yawned and stretched out on the floor, in a deliberately lazy manner, ignoring his brothers look of disapproval. Allen shuffled his clawed feet around on the mountainous landscape that was George's hand. Being a canary, he decided, was far more inconvenient than funny. He would have to see if there was any way to alter the spell so that it only lasted five minutes or so. This was getting ridiculous. He was just beginning to wonder how to communicate to the twins that they needed to look for a counter curse when he began to feel rather odd again. He hopefully extended his wing again and shook it out. A couple feathers fell out and a few minutes later he grew back into a human.\n\n\"Hey man, you feel OK?\" Fred asked, sitting up and digging out his clipboard from a stack of discarded parchment\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I am fine\" Allen said impatiently waving his hand dismissively\n\n\"Now what spell did you use? Or was it a potion?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>George watched Allen and Fred as they made notes on the clipboard and shook his head in mild amusement. It looked like his little baby prankster had graduated after all<p>\n\nBetween the DA, detentions with Umbridge and Weasly Wizard Wheezes Allen was struggling to make his way down to train with Firenze and Bane as often as he would like. He was beginning to get rather frustrated with the whole thing to be honest- he had thought that he was making progress but now all progress had ceased and he was still incapable of holding his arm's form for longer than a few seconds. He was struggling to sleep now and nightmares full of tortured Akuma souls plagued him when he did succeed in dozing off. Every day he wasted, souls were suffering and this increasing pressure was causing him to become more and more withdrawn and driven. His friends were becoming increasingly concerned for him and in an attempt to force him to take a bit of time off, Harry and Ron unashamedly guilt tripped him into coming to the quidditch match\n\n\"You are coming to see us, right mate?\" Harry had said off-handedly during their practice session for vanishing charms\n\n\"Err..\" Allen had replied vaguely, with an uncertain look on his face\n\n\"It's just, you know\" Ron had interjected, a hopeful and pleading look in his eyes\n\n\"Seeing as it is my first game and all, I really hoped all my friends would be there\" He ducked his head meekly\n\n\"It'd really make me feel so much better, knowing you and Hermione were in the crowd, cheering me on you know. But I mean, if you have better stuff to be doing...\"\n\nSo Allen found himself walking side by side with Hermione, Mai and Luna who was sporting a sincerely impressive lion's- head hat. They filed into the weathered and battered stands, finding a bench near the top so that they would have a better vantage point of the pitch. The wooden benches were covered in a thin layer of frost, as was the quidditch pitch and this caused the entire stadium to glitter and sparkle coldly in the weak sunlight\n\n\"Good conditions for playing\" Hermione said, surveying the sky\n\n\"I remember reading in 'Quiddich through the ages' that a 'frosty winter's morning without too much sun' was Gwennog's preferred condition to play in\"\n\nAllen smiled slightly at this, it was a testimony to Hermione's dedication that she read into her friend's sports so that she could try and understand their fascination with it, though it was still pretty obvious that she understood little beyond the semantics of the game and the main reason she attended was to support Harry and Ron. Allen sat down next to Luna, with Mai on his other side. His relationship with Luna had gone through a rather awkward phase after their breakup but after having a conversation with her, he realised that the awkwardness had purely been on his side and she had no problems with returning to their previous friendship. To be perfectly honest, this decision had hardly effected their relationship at all. Sure there was less in the way of physical contact but they really hadn't been much of a PDA couple anyway. He began to wonder actually if he had ever really felt 'in love' with her at all- when you read of these things in books, they always made it sound so passionate and strong whereas in his case, he had just found her really easy to talk to- with her absence of judgement (and some would argue, perspective). It had been a refreshing change from most of the people he had met and he felt she had so little experience with relationships of any sort due to others intolerance of her that she perhaps hadn't fully understood her feelings either. Regardless of this, he did not regret their relationship and his fondness for her quirky ways had not lessened at all and he was now amusing himself by watching Hermione's strained expression while Luna re-kindled the argument about the existence of Heliopaths. They ceased their bickering when the match started and focussed their attention instead on the pitch. The Slytherin side started up a spiteful song and Allen watched, anguished, as Ron became more and more flustered, fumbling each and every goal. He cringed inwardly remembering the delicate way with which Harry had danced around the subject when they had asked him how good Ron was as Keeper. He was beginning to understand why now- perhaps under different circumstances, he would be better but it was obvious that he was immensely insecure and the chanting on the Slytherin side was completely knocking him off. With each verse, Allen grew more enraged and even when Harry finally snatched the fleeing golden snitch from underneath Malfoy's nose, he was barely containing his rage. His body was literally trembling and both Luna and Hermione were watching him with some concern\n\n\"Allen...\" Hermione began nervously\n\n\"Are... are you all right?\"\n\nAllen wasn't even capable of speech, the rage building up inside him was so strong. He felt a flash of power, similar to that of his innocence and the wood of his chair that he was gripping splintered beneath his grip. Mai reached over and wrapped her arms around Allen's neck, hugging him tight\n\n\"People shouldn't make fun of other peoples families\" She said quietly to Hermione, uncharacteristically serious. Allen released the chair and his rage cooled almost instantly. He wrapped his arms around Mai's tiny body and squeezed her gently\n\n\"When did you become so grown up, eh?\" He said gently teasingly, though with just a hint of sadness in his eyes. Mai just giggled then spun around as Luna gasped and pointed to the pitch. The four teens watched helplessly as Harry and George pummelled Malfoy's prone figure. The entire stadium fell silent as all the students watched the fight in awe. The mood as the students filed out of the pitch was less exited and jubilant than usual and low mutterings and whispered conversations were all centred around the same subject- Harry and George\n\n\"... Completely unacceptable. Betcha they'll get expelled\"  \n>\"... a right stuck up prick- deserved every punch\"<p>\n\n\"Wish I had been able to give a hand!\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"Can't believe it!\"<p>\n\nAllen dropped Mai off at her room and retired to the common room to wait on Harry's return. Hours later, the common room door swung open and Harry climbed in, followed by the twins. They were all white as sheets and seemed shell shocked. Harry was still grasping the tiny golden snitch that he had won the match with. Its wings were flapping in a weary manner against his knuckles in a pointless effort to free itself\n\n\"We are banned\" Harry said hollowly\n\n\"From ever playing again\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>Fred and George stared blankly ahead as Angela struggled to digest the news that she had lost both her beaters and her seeker in one fell swoop. She stumbled from the fireplace up to her room looking utterly devastated and the twins soon followed suit. Watching their devastated faces planted a seed of anger in Allen's stomach, completely different from the bursts of rage he had felt over the past few months, this was a slow burning hatred and he swore then that he would pay that foul woman back for the pain she had caused his friends. He was just beginning to string together a plan when Hermione let out a cry of joy- Hagrid was back!<p>\n\nThe return of Hagrid was causing equal levels of joy and stress in the group as they all knew without a shadow of a doubt that Umbridge would be after his skin and with the frequent arrival of Educational Decrees, she was becoming increasingly dangerous to cross. This however was not dampening Allen's determination to pay her back for hurting his friends so deeply. Though, he now that he had Harry joining him in detention, the whole affair felt a little more bearable- as bad as that made him feel. He had begun concocting his plans for revenge with the twins, who had wholeheartedly backed his idea with a single-minded determinedness he had rarely seen them demonstrate before. They had taken the loss of their freedom very seriously and had decided that Umbridge had graduated from a mild inconvenience to a full blown enemy, and they were out for blood. The thought of defying her in such a way helped him get through the next few days, though when it came to her inspection of Hagrid's lesson, he actually had to recite the plans for the prank in his head at a mental shout to distract himself from the overwhelming urge he had to punch her in the face. The urge grew so strong that his arm actually manifested itself for a goof minute before crumbling slowly into dust once again and this shocked him so much that he almost forgot his anger. That evening, he tried his best to recreate the feelings he had when it had materialised and the session was slightly- ever so slightly- more productive than usual\n\n\"Not bad\" Said Firenze when the had finished, trotting over to Allen who was squatting on the ground, panting heavily\n\n\"You seemed different today- what has changed?\"\n\n\"My arm manifest itself earlier this evening- when I got really angry at Umbridge so I was trying to recreate that emotion. Didn't work quite as well as expected though.\" Allen explained, swiping the sweat from his forehead and gulping down huge draughts of icy cold water from an old butterbeer flagon\n\nFirenze pondered this for a while before saying, in his slow, calm tone\n\n\"So your weapon is emotionally linked to you. Interesting. That may be the key\" He studied Allen intently and then nodded affirmatively\n\n\"Yes, that is the key. I see it now\"\n\n\"What!?\" Allen squeaked, excitement barely contained\n\n\"What is the key\" But Firenze shook his head decisively\n\n\"I cannot interfere in your destiny so radically. You are fated to save this world, young foal. If you do not find your own way to this answer then you will never fulfil this fate. You will reach understanding when you are ready to evolve and become something more\"\n\nAllen gaped\n\n\"Are you _serious?\" _He said incredulously.\n\nFirenze looked at him blankly\n\n\"Of course I'm...\"\n\n\"_You are just going to tell me you know what is holding me back and then __**refuse **__to tell me what it is?\" _His voice had become horse with indignation and despite his best attempts, it was refusing to get louder than its current half-whisper. Firenze looked rather surprised at his usually placid pupil's reaction.\n\n\"I will of course continue to train you, but Allen, this is something you must reach on your own. You must understand that\"\n\nAllen took another large swig of the cold water in an attempt to calm himself down but just ended up choking and spitting half the contents out, dribbling it all over his robes and completely ruining the air of maturity he was trying to portray. By the time he had cleared the water from his lungs and began breathing properly again, he had recovered slightly from Firenze's bombshell.\n\n\"OK\" He said in a slightly calmer voice\n\n\"So all I need to do is access the right emotion and I will be able to control my innocence again?\"\n\nFirenze put his head on one side and pulled a face\n\n\"It's more complicated than a simple emotion. You need to grow and change before your innocence will accept you again. It abandoned you for a reason, Allen and you must prove to it once more that you are worthy to wield such a weapon\"\n\nHaving dropped this final bombshell, he turned sharply, his tail swishing dramatically and he trotted off out of sight, disappearing into the darkness of the forest with very little noise, despite his bulk\n\n\"Show off\" Allen muttered bitterly and slowly got back to his feet\n\n\"Well this is just fabulous\" He said bitterly to no one as he strode back toward the foreboding dark silhouette that was Hogwart's castle\n\n\"I just need to change a fundamental aspect of my character. How difficult can that be?\"\n\nHe paused momentarily and cocked his head to one side, convinced for half a second that he had heard a dark chuckle but he shook his head dismissively and continued on his way\n\n\"Loosing my mind\" He muttered to himself as he exited the tangled trees and entered the open grounds of the castle.\n\nAllen trooped down to the forbidden forest again, this time accompanied by his classmates as they followed Hagrid into the tangle of trees that had begun to feel like home to him- perhaps even more so than the castle at the moment, which was part of the reason he was willing Umbridge away with all his strength. He knew there was little point in trying, that there was no way she would miss such an opportunity to carry out her vendetta on all 'half-breeds' but he could hope, miracles sometimes happened, right?. Hagrid let out an ear-splitting shriek and soon enough, the great skeletal horses that usually pulled the school carriages appeared. Allen viewed the bony creatures with some curiosity, he was wondering what their deal was, he knew that very few students could actually see them. In fact, the only people he knew that saw them were Luna, Harry and himself. He noticed that Neville flinched slightly at their arrival- so he could see them too... Hagrid went on to explain that only those who had seen death could see the Thestrals. This threw a whole new light on the odd creatures that looked dead, but were alive and could only be seen by those who had actually seen death. It was somewhat symbolic of the way that viewing death affected life. No matter how aware someone may be of death, actually viewing it was always different and it never failed to make an impact on the way you viewed your own life, and the lives of others. It changed you. This thought brought Allen back to Firenze's words- that he needed to change certain things about himself before the innocence would accept him back. He wondered if his constant exposure to death over the years had changed and twisted him so much tat even the innocence refused to resonate with him any more. Perhaps he had become unworthy of it. which was a horrible thought. Seeing all those deaths had only intensified the determination with which he fought but perhaps this had been his downfall. This though hit him like a physical blow. Was it possible that his innocence had left him because he had seen so many deaths that he was no longer worthy of its service? At this point Umbridge turned up but even her presence wasn't enough to distract him from this troubling thought. But he hadn't become apathetic- he cared so much, gave his all every fight, why, the very fight he had lost his arm in, he had been doing all he could to save Suman. Had given every ounce of his being. His remaining hand twinged in memory of the incidence.\n\n_But maybe _a voice whispered in his subconscious _that was where you were going wrong. You cannot save everyone, you are not God. Sacrificing yourself for one person is not for the greater goo- _NO! He could not accept that. He had to save everyone that he could. He couldn't just leave someone knowing that they were going to die if he didn't intervene! The voice began to form a retort and he pushed it out of his mind, silencing his thoughts, but not before Kanda's face flashed before his eyes- berating him for trying to chase after Harry that night in the graveyard, then Lavi's face that time he had cut down all of the Akuma in France without giving any of his comrade's the trust they deserved, then Lenalee's as he dragged Suman half dead out of the destroyed, monstrous body as she stared on in horror. Bile rose in his throat and it was all he could do not to throw up there and then. The other three were thankfully too distracted to notice his distress and he was able to slip off down to the lake as they entered the castle without them noticing. He blindly stumbled down to the lake and wondered aimlessly around the edges, trying to fight down the waves of disconcerting thoughts that were crashing over his body again and again. He had been there for an hour or so when a familiar blonde head made its way down to the lake edge. Luna sat down and began stringing carefully picked windflowers together in a complicated braid, humming absently as she did so. He half wanted to go to her but immediately had the impulse arisen, it disappeared. How could she understand what he was going through, the life he led, the choices he had to make. Her world was the world he was protecting but he was not a part of it any more. With a heavy heart, he made his way back to the castle, performing a disillusionment charm over himself as he went, not wanting her to see him.\n\nA few weeks later, Allen was woken from his sleep by Harry shouting bloody murder in the bed next to him. He half fell out of his bed in his hurry to reach his friend, his bedsheets tangling up his feet as he struggled over. Harry seemed to still be asleep but was shouting like he had been lit on fire. Allen reached over to shake his friend awake but had barely touched his shoulder when Harry suddenly sat bolt upright, his face an unhealthy shade of white. He promptly rolled onto his side and threw up over the edge of his four poster bed (mercifully on the opposite side from where Allen was standing). Allen pulled the tangled bed sheets off his friend and helped Harry sit up, gently rubbing his between the shoulder blades and carefully positioning himself out of the aim of his mouth. By this stage, the other boys had woken too, sleepily stirring from their slumber and then growing suddenly more awake as they realised what had happened. Dean and Thomas watched concernedly from their beds but both Ron and Neville ran to Harry's aid. Ron was at the other side of the bed and he shot a concerned look over the top of Harry's head to Allen. Harry himself seemed completely oblivious to their concern and merely gasped at Ron\n\n\"It's your dad! He's been attacked\n\nRon gazed uncomprehendingly at his friend\n\n\"I don't... what... what are you talking about\n\n\"He's been bitten. There is blood... everywhere\"\n\nSomewhere in the background, Dean and Seamus began muttering.\n\n\"You must've been dreaming\" Ron said faintly, hopefully but his voice lacked conviction and he looked terrified. Allen remembered all that Dumbledore had told him about the link between Voldemort and Harry and decided to take no risks\n\n\"Harry, where was Mr Weasly when he got attacked and who did it?\"\n\nHarry turned his pale face desperately to Allen, his eyes pained and confused\n\n* * *\n\n><p>\"I don't... it... a corridor somewhere, that was all I saw and I... it... he was... there was a snake and... he was bitten. It's bad Allen\" His burning gaze bore into Allen and he wondered at Harry's painful pauses. It seemed to him that there was something that he was holding back. He had no time however to get it out of him and quickly turned on his heel and sprinted out of the dorm, following the familiar pathway to Dumbledore's office, not even pausing as he streaked past McGonagall in her tartan dressing gown, ignoring her scandalised cries<p>\n\nThe pale dawn crept over the windowsills in Hogwart's and illuminated a mostly empty corridor, with a lone figure making its way down the deserted hallways. The Wesley's and Harry had disappeared to Sirius's home and Dumbledore was 'sorting some things out' as he so aptly put it. There was a lot of red tape involved when a member of the ministry- particularly one already under suspicion- was found half-dead in the department of mysteries. Not that Mr Weasly had been found there at all- for he was not supposed to have figured that out. He wearily wondered what this mysterious weapon was that the order were protecting so vigilantly. What could possible have interested Voldemort so much that he was willing to blow this lovely cover he had created for himself and come out into the open? It must be something huge, something really...\n\n\"Hem hem\"\n\nDread poured over him, dozing his body in its icy chill\n\n\"Mr. Walker, what are you doing out of your dormitory at this hour?\"\n\n* * *\n\n><p>wave after wave of trepidation hit him. This was not good. Not good at all<p> \n\n\n\t48. Chapter 48\n\n**A/N: Hey guys :) Me again. Hope you like this new chapter, and please give opinions especially on the last lil bit as it is me interfering and casting a little conjuncture on the man 'verse. Hope you like my idea... but yeah. Hope you enjoy though advanced warning, had to write this rather quickly due to impending internet-less-ness and I didn't want to not post again for a number of months so I rushed the writing of this**\n\n**Shirubagure: When does Allen ever ****_not_**** get in trouble, that is my question! And as for Allen and Luna, it depends on what you classify love as. He definitely did love her, just perhaps not romantic love and bear in mind, he is like 15 still so has no idea yet what real love is, its hardly surprising he confused the two. So many people do...**\n\n**Ennael: I know, I did disappear for rather a long time. Back though! The next wont be posted for at least 3 weeks however as I am headed off to places without internet or laptops... sorry! I may disappoint you slightly as I sort of skip over the Ark arc. As I see it, the Ark story will go the same in this as it does in the manga so I don't see much point in writing it all out again. I may write up the last scene with Road/ Lavi and the piano bit in the next chapter but I will see how determined I am to get it in. Hope you enjoy!**\n\n**Coronadomontes: Yes I do hate Umbridge and all her ilk with all of my hate! Wish I had time to put more Umbridge bashing in the story. I was going to have Allen, Fred and George playing some huge big prank on her but ran out of time and inspiration. You may have notices I have been suffering from a touch of writers block in the past few months :P Hopefully over it now! **\n\n**Werecat-Yoruichi: Allen finally reaches the rest of them! You can see I stretched the timeline somewhat but I hope it still works**\n\n**Meloignon: I read back through my story. Man I actually do have a lot of typo's! :S Soz!**\n\n\"_What did I just do?\"_\n\nAllen blasted a path through a pile of twisted brambles, clearing his way\n\n\"_WHAT did I just do?\"_\n\nEchoing roars from Umbridge met his ears and he bent down, lifting Mai up by the back of her dress and swung her onto his back where she clung like a spider monkey, her breathing fast and panicked in his ear\n\n\"_Dumbledore is going to kill me\"_\n\nBut Dumbledore wasn't there- that was the whole problem. He had left to deal with the Harry situation the day before and yet to return.\n\nAllen ducked under a low hanging branch just in time\n\nUmbridge had therefore been given free reign to interrogate him any way she saw fit. A wave of nausia swept over him again and he had to stop to retch behind a tree but there was nothing left in his stomach to come back up. He wiped the back of his mouth and turned sharply to his right, ploughing through the thick undergrowth of the forbidden forest. The thick vines and branches curled around his feet, tripping him. Slowing him. The trees were beginning to crowd closer together, looming in, staring down curiously at the two fugitives battling their way through their roots. Allen twisted around as he ran and caught a glimpse of Umbridge's hideous, red face, twisted into a snarl as she pursued them doggedly.\n\nShe had started off with mere threats and intimidations however it had not taken long for her personal vendetta against him to come to the fore. She had tried to give him Veriteserum in a cup of tea but when he refused to drink it, she had attempted to hold him down as she forced it down his throat. After he had smashed the potion bottle, she had really lost her cool. Imperio. Cruciatus curse. He had avoided and fought these as she flung them crazedly at him, spit flying from her mouth as she screamed insults and questions at him in turn\n\n\"_**Where did Harry and Dumbledore go?\"**_\n\n_**Allen struggled against the Imperius curse, glaring at her defiantly, trying not to look strained as he fought off the third Imperius in a row. He really needed to improve his ducking reflex.**_\n\n\"_**I. Don't. Know\" He spat out from between gritted teeth, struggling against the spell she was holding him with. A deranged smile made its way across her face as she tantalisingly waved his wand in front of his eyes**_\n\n\"_**Ah-ah-ah I am afraid I do not believe you Mister Walker. I suggest you come up with a better answer than that. There is no point in pretending you do not know. You don't really want to know what I have in store for you if you continue to resist\"**_\n\n_**Her toad-like grin grew even wider and a cold chill ran down Allen's spine. She really had cracked. She was acting like a maniac**_\n\n\"_**You can't **_**do ****_this\" He protested _**\n\n\"_**I am a minor! And you are a teacher- you can't **_**use ****_torture against me\"_**\n\n_**Umbridge widened her eyes mockingly and made a pantomime of looking all around her**_\n\n\"_**Really? Well that's just too bad isn't it? I could really get into trouble for what I am doing, couldn't I? Shame no one is here to see what I am doing, isn't it\"**_\n\n_**She lent forward till her face was mere inches from his, the flecks of her spit actually hitting his face as she spoke**_\n\n\"_**Also I believe you are under the delusion that the government actually cares what happens to you, you filthy half-breed. You just try to take me to court once I get the information from you. I could use a good laugh\"**_\n\n_**She laughed at this, waves of her putrid breath rolling over him. There was a tap on the window of her office and a triumphant gleam lit in her eyes. Allen's stomach did a horrible double backflip. What ever this was, it was not going to be good news for him. Umbridge walked over to the window and let the tawny owl in, releasing the officious looking scroll from its leg. She laughed out loud again, a cold, callous cackle that only served to increase Allen's fear. She straitened the pink bow in her hair and smoothed down her robes. She fussed a little while with her hair, the silence dragging on unbearably. When she had finally sorted herself out she spoke again, her voice returning to its usual girly tone**_\n\n\"_**Now Mister Walker, I believe we can proceed in a more civilised manner\"**_\n\n\"_**What?\" He spat, unable to contain himself**_\n\n\"_**All of a sudden come to the realisation that torturing helpless minors is immoral?\"**_\n\n_**Umbridge tittered at this as if he had made some little amusing remark**_\n\n\"_**Oh no, not at all dear boy, I just now have something much more effective\" She waved the officious scroll, looking as smug as could be**_\n\n\"_**Changing from unforgivable curses to paper cuts? How you are moving up in the world...\" Allen's bravado wasn't even fooling himself at this stage and Umbridge giggled again. She unscrolled the parchment and began reading out loud**_\n\n\" _From the Department of Under-aged Wizards_\n\n_Dear Dolores Jane Umbridge_\n\n_We have reviewed the situation of Mai Dumbledore at your personal request and, taking into consideration your personal concerns about her welfare... __**blah blah blah\" He glanced over the top to Allen's ashen face**_\n\n\"_**Legal talk you know... let me skip to the good part, ah, yes.**__ We feel that it would be in the best interests of the child if she were moved from her current unstable environment to a government-run home\"_\n\nAfter that, everything had been a little bit of a blur. He had been aware of a wave of pure rage flowing through him- he'd finally had enough. He had been trapped in this school for the best part of 4 months being alternately tortured by Umbridge and by his training in a futile attempt to return to the battle field and not only had he failed to achieve this, but now he stood to lose Mai too. He remembered with a flash the first time he found her, lying abandoned in the middle of that half-destroyed town. Starving and alone. Her helplessness had spoken to something in him and he had felt pity for her like he had never felt until that first time he saw an akuma's soul. The first time he had ever stopped wallowing in his own self-pity for long enough to notice the suffering of others. Why didn't everyone see? How could they not see this? Why was no one else willing to lay all on the line to save these poor, pitiful creatures- humans and Akuma- suffering alike. All this schooling and red tape and politics. None of it mattered. All that mattered was that right now, there were thousands of poor tortured souls out there waiting for him. Waiting for the only person on this god-forsaken earth who cared about them to come for them. Human and Akuma alike. He had a duty to fulfil and he was _not _wasting one more precious second on this _toad._ This feeling had flooded through his entire being and with it, the familiar feeling of his innocence activating. He hadn't even really though through what he was doing, his innocence just followed his intentions as if it had never left him. Umbridge had been pinned up against the wall by white strands, causing her to drop his wand which Allen promptly scooped up. He dropped her non-to-gently to the ground and ran out the door, sealing even as he sprinted down to Mai's nursery.\n\n* * *\n\n>He had caused a significant amount of raucous as he left which perhaps had been ill advised however, in his defence, he had really been in a rather bad mood. He had cast the sonorous charm that Bagman had used so frequently the year before at the Triwizard Tournament. The students were all in class and came bursting out at the noise, teachers peering curiously the top of their heads as Allen told them what had just happened. They probably wouldn't have believed him but Umbridge blasted her door off its hinges and (as he had been hoping for). She got so incensed at his performance that she charged at him, wand raised and he had ran for his life Mai clutched under one arm and his wand in his newly-formed arm. If that didn't convince the students that he and Harry were telling the truth about the ministry, he didn't know what would. He knew that he couldn't apperate until he exited the grounds which was where he was headed right now. He had hoped that when he ducked into the forbidden forest that she would give up but that hadn't worked. He exited the forest again, swinging Mai around so she was clinging to his front, protected from any spells Umbridge may shoot at them. The gate was now thankfully in sight. A stunning spell shot scarily close to him as he shot across the open grounds pointing his wand at the gates as he ran, shouting the incantations to remove the protective enchantment around them as he went. He was barely five meters from them when a stunning spell collided with his back however, the new innocence- which appeared to have taken the shape of a cloak- shielded him from any damage and he burst through the gates, twisting as he did so, dissaperating with a loud and resonating <em>crack.<em>\n\nThere was a loud crack on Grimmauld Place street and a white haired boy appeared out of nowhere, clutching a small child to his chest. He scanned the street carefully before running up to the space between houses 11 and 13 before dissapearing as suddenly as he had appeared, seemingly into nothing. The homeless man who had watched this all transpire from his spot in the shadow of the street's bins shook his head woefully\n\n\"Those darn aliens again\" He sighed exasperatedly. Now he was going to have to find somewhere else to squat. And he had really liked this area too...\n\nMeanwhile, in Grimmauld place, Allen was hurriedly alternating between asking for news about Mr Weasly and telling them what had happened at Hogwarts\n\n\"I am so glad your father isn't too badly injured\" Allen said squeezing Ron's shoulder and giving Ginny a one armed hug which she accepted gratefully\n\n\"But what about you?\" Hermione said, her voice scared\n\n\"You're going to be in big trouble now Allen- you assaulted a ministry official!\"\n\nAllen shrugged, scowling darkly\n\n\"She deserved much worse than I gave her. Besides, my innocence is back now so I amn't exactly going to be sticking around much longer\"\n\nThere was an outcry of shock and anger at this and he had to yell to be heard over the raucous\n\n\"_NO, really I am going\"_\n\n\"But you can't just _go\" _Hermione insisted furiously\n\n\"Why not?\" He asked, his patience beginning to run thin\n\n\"I have already explained the situation to you- Hermione, people are dying, the world as we know it is literally ending. I have to go and you know it. Besides, as you say, I can hardly return to Hogwarts now. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't go rejoin the battle\"\n\nHermione spluttered and stammered uncertainly then desperately said\n\n\"You still have the trace on you Allen, you can't even do magic outside without the ministry knowing\"\n\nAllen smiled slightly\n\n\"Dumbledore should be taking care of that right now. Ah!\"\n\nA flame ignited mid-air and a slightly scorched piece of parchment floated down from nowhere. Allen caught it as it fluttered toward the floor\n\n\"There\" He said with some relief\n\n\"I am released from the trace. Look, I know you all don't want to see me go and I wish things could be different but... there really is no other option\"\n\nSirius, who had been watching the proceedings from the sidelines disappeared off into the house and returned a few moments later to a much subdued group\n\n\"Allen\" He said holding out a hand-held glass\n\n\"Take this with you. It's a two way mirror. Harry has the second and I have the third. Just say our names and you'll be able to see through our mirrors and talk to us. It'll be a way to keep in contact while you are away. Might help soothe their fears, you know. And Mai will be staying here with me I am sure, so she can talk to you through this too\"\n\nAllen gaped rather wordlessly as this wonderful act of generosity and accepted it, stammering out his thanks to Sirius as he did so. Sirius just waved his gratitude away\n\n\"Don't you worry about it. It's the least I could do for you. Now, come on guys. Lets leave Allen and Mai alone for a few minutes, OK?\"\n\nThey queued up one by one to hug Allen and say goodbye. Hermione wasn't even able to form words and merely made a gulping noise and shook her head, hugging him close to her. He kissed the top of her head and whispered\n\n\"Don't worry, I am going to be fine\"\n\nRon and Harry clapped him on the shoulder firmly and glared determinedly into his eyes, refusing to cry.\n\n\"See you soon, mate\" Ron said stiffly\n\n\"Yeah\" Harry echoed\n\n\"Soon\"\n\nAllen nodded, smiling slightly and they all trouped one by one out of the room, leaving him and Mai alone. Allen hunkered down so he was the same height as Mai who was watching him with her big, soulful eyes. She quite clearly knew exactly what he was about to say and though bright tears were brimming in her chocolate eyes, they did not overspill. Allen kissed her forehead gently and rubbed noses with her smiling reassuringly\n\n\"You'll be ok Mai. I am going now but you will be well looked after here by Sirius. Hagrid and Dumbledore will stop by as well to see you and Mrs Weasly too. You'll be properly spoilt\"\n\nShe gave a wavering smile at this and nodded\n\n\"I love you very much, you know that. More than anyone else in this whole wide world. That is why I have to go, I know you don't really understand this yet, but there is a cruel man out there tearing apart families and destroying this world. I need to fight him to save this earth for you and for everyone else too. It is my duty\" He said this last part with conviction then, more quietly \"It is my purpose\"\n\n* * *\n\n>He embraced her again then turned and left, pretending not to notice the tears that had finally over-spilt down her cheeks, soaking into her little blue pinafore as he left her alone in the landing. <em>This is the worst thing about war he thought as he exited the building there are always far more civilian injuries and deaths than military<em>\n\nAllen wasted the next few hours trying to figure out where to apperate to, wishing more than ever that he had Timcampy with him. Thankfully the Noah were looking for him too- they obviously hadn't been convinced that he had really died and Allen had only just released the soul of a stray level one he had found floating alone when a level 3 showed up. He had been pushed to his limits fighting against that poor tortured creature however, he was pretty sure that once he got used to this new form of his innocence that he would easily be able to take down any further level three's that turned up. His cloak acted like a shield and offensive weapon alike. He could even use it to move quickly out of the way of attacks and his arm seemed now to be much easier to use. It almost felt like this was the way it should have been the whole time. Like its initial form had been childlike and it had now matured into its true form. The soul of the akuma he had just released smiled at him as it faded\n\n\"Take the arc\" It said\n\n\"It will lead you to your friends\"\n\nAllen nodded and placed his hand over his heart, bowing in respect to the soul- finally released from its cruel chains\n\n\"Goodnight my friend. Safe journey\"\n\n* * *\n\n>He approached the door with some trepidation, but there had been nothing but truth in that Akuma's eyes and he knew that he meant him no harm so, without a backward look, he stepped through the door and was enveloped in its blinding light which briefly flared as he stepped through and disappeared as he shut it with a resounding snap, leaving the dark frame floating ghost-like a few inches above the scorched and blackened ground<p><p>\n\nThe scene Allen walked into was one of sheer destruction on a scale he had never seen before in his life. He took in the scattered bodies on the decimated landscape before noticing Lenalee- suspended in a large crystal-like substance and the Earl bearing down upon her. Within seconds, he was behind her. He wrapped one arm around her waist, pulling her close to his side and he sunk the claw of his other hand deep into the Earls face. He grinned widely, filled with euphoria at having finally reached the battle field once again\n\n\"Good evening, Earl\"\n\nHe tightened his grip but the Earl twisted out of his way, drawing his sword as he did so but rather than attack, he drew back\n\n\"Its funny\" He said, cocking his head to one side as Allen blocked his strike with his arm, glaring blazingly- defiantly- into his eyes.\n\n\"You remind me of the 'white-faced clown, who fights the Aususte clown\"\n\nWith a swirl of his cloak he disappeared. Allen cursed under his breath and scanned the skies for his enemy. His eyes raked the landscape but he couldn't see him anywhere. He spied Lavi's bright hair down on the ground, his form stirring slightly. He looked hurt, but still alive. Allen flew down and landed beside him.\n\n\"Lavi! Have you seen the Earl anywhere?\"\n\nLavi's bright green eyes were confused and he didn't answer, only stuttered out\n\n\"A-akuma?\"\n\nAlen was confused for a moment before remembering that he was still in his invoked form and Lavi had never seen it before. He was about to explain who he was when Kanda appeared out of nowhere and if it hadn't been for Allen's quick reflexes, he would have lost his head. He barely ducked out of the way in time\n\n\"Kanda!\" He yelled before the psycopath could attack again. Recognition sparked in Kanda's eyes and though he didn't relax his sword, he didn't attack again\n\n\"Tch. What do you think you are doing, moyashi? You're supposed to be dead, not messing with my battle\"\n\nAllen bristled irritably at his attitude\n\n\"My name is _Allen _and shouldn't you be apologising to me? Attacking your own side is hardly a good battle plan now is it? Sorry to disappoint you, but I didn't die\"\n\nHe relaxed his form slightly, the mask and cloak pulling back showing his face\n\n\"The day is still young\" Kanda muttered\n\n\"I won't give up hope yet\"\n\nLavi, though, got unsteadily to his feet and embraced his friend tightly\n\n\"Good to see you in the land of the living Allen\" He choked out, pulling back, his green eye sparkling slightly\n\nAllen laughed\n\n\"Good to be here too. Now where did all of the Noah go? I was fighting the Earl, like, 2 minutes ago\" He scanned the sky again but could see no sign of any of them\n\n\"I was fighting the perm-haired one a minute ago too\" Kanda unwillingly chipped in, scouring the skies too, in search of his prey but they were nowhere to be seen. The rest of the exorcists too were searching the skies for their enemies who all seemed to have disappeared instantaneously. They made use of this time to recuperate- Allen returning to the rooftop that he had deposited Lenalee while fighting the Earl and bringing her over to join Lavi and Kanda, who- for all his antagonism toward his companions, stayed to listen to the conversation. Lenalee hugged Allen enthusiastically, tears streaming openly down her face\n\n\"It is good to have you back with us Allen, its not been the same without you\" Allen hugged her back, smiling and despite his best efforts, tears slipped down his cheeks too\n\n\"Haha- Crybaby!\" Lavi guffawed as he watched the two as they embraced\n\n\"Just wait till I tell Komui you been hugging his little sister! ~Looks like our little Allen has a cruuush~\"\n\n\"Oh hush Lavi\" Lenalee said, a hint of sharpness in her voice\n\n\"You're the one who has hardly strung two words together since Allen disappeared. Don't go acting all macho now. _Boys!\"_\n\nAllen quickly diverted them from any bickering and explained where he had been and how he had survived- invoking his new innocence at Lavi's request, pleased by their delight at its new form\n\n\"What have you guys been up to while I have been recuperating? Did you ever find my master?\"\n\nLenalee and Lavi exchanged significant looks\n\n\"Nope\" Lavi said heavily\n\n\"We got really close but all we got was some Akuma or other that he had been working on. He managed to give her free will back again somehow. We don't really know how. Komui always said he was one of the most talented workers in the science division\"  \n>\"If you ask me\" Lenalee said, smiling fondly<p>\n\n\"My brother would actually rival him. If Reever ever was brave enough to allow him out of his office and into the labs that is\"\n\nLavi and Allen shuddered at the thought\n\n* * *\n\n>\"I think we would all rather that never ever happened\" Allen said and Lavi nodded emphatically. Allen grinned at Lenalee but her returned smile turned into a look of shock and fear as the ground opened up beneath her feet and a swirling black vortex swallowed her whole. Without even a seconds hesitation, all three of the boys flung themselves into the swirling vortex after her. No sooner had Kanda's heel disappeared through the portal than it snapped shut, leaving nothing behind it<p><p>\n\n_Golden leaves fell down in showers around two boys playing in the roots of a gnarled Oak tree. Their laughter rang through the empty grounds as they ran in circles around the trunk- neither sure who was catching and who was running_\n\n_Soft hands and a kind voice- a mother kisses the forehead of a child and says_\n\n\"_You really should be more careful darling, you'll seriously hurt yourself one of these days\" And though felling patronised and impatient, the child also felt loved and safe_\n\n**wish the memories would stop. Need to waken**\n\n_The brother makes a twig float in the air. The child watching tries to do the same but can't and the brother smiles, dropping the twig and playing a game instead_\n\n_In an empty room, the child sits and concentrates hard on one of his toys. He wants to be able to make things move, like his brother does but the toy stays stationary_\n\n_He is ill- everything hurts. The brother and mother are panicking- doctors are called, medicine is given but the pain doesn't abate. It rages on and on until it is no more and he is alone without it and he is different because of it_\n\n_A man appears and tells him he is special, tells him he has powers. He tries to explain that he doesn't- that his brother does. That he is not special but the man asks him to try again. He looks over at the grand piano in the corner of the room and wonders. He closes his eyes and feels the keys- the music- the pieces with his mind. All those pieces fitting together, making a whole. It was sickening. Together, together, together. His thoughts raced stronger and his eyes flew open. The piano crumbled into dust with a sigh and the man smiled._\n\n_He was in a new world, with a new family and they understood his power. He was strong, so strong. He was going to gain power till he could take the whole world apart and let it's pieces go. Together. Whole. It was sickening. The brother appeared_\n\n**No**\n\n_He was talking and talking but _he_ was more powerful now _he _was special_\n\n**No**\n\n_He tried to make him go away with his words and the feelings he was making but he wouldn't go. He made the memories appear, of trees and leaves and kind words and his heart strings tugged. It hurt. He shouted at the brother but he kept pushing till he snapped and spun around. To take him apart and let the memories fall away. His power burst out but something held them back. He fell to his knees when he realised what he had almost done and the brother lowered his wand_\n\n\"_It's OK Neah. I am here now\"_\n\n_His power changed and he began to piece things together, opening up a whole new world. He could see the components and he could see the whole- the world seemed a song. A cacophony of melodies strung together in a composition too wonderful and terrible to comprehend and in trying to comprehend it, he came to himself. At first his family were pleased, then their father grew less pleased. The brother was unhappy with the Fathers plans and told him. He began to wonder. Was the melody of the humans so terrible. It was disharmonious to be sure. The discords and jarring notes turned his stomach but he looked at his brother and looked at his mother and the song sweetened. He tried to explain this but the Father grew angry and his song changed. Or rather, the top layer disappeared and the chaos underneath came out. He grew frightened_\n\n**I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS AGAIN**\n\n_Gathered around the tree, the golden leaves fell as the sky cried and the earth opened up it maw and swallowed his mother whole, taking her to itself leaving him bereft. The brother tried to speak but his words fell flat. He had caused this. He had left her. Left her for the alcohol and friends then called her from safety to come fetch him from his own disaster and she had died for nothing that she had done trying to save him from everything he had done. The human song seemed more bitter than ever before and his own tune turned chaotic_\n\n_He was held- the man in white held him with his detestable innocence as his brother shouted through the roaring cacophony that had struck up its chords on that day. The tune raged and raged till the words began to make the jarring notes make sense_\n\n\"_It was the Earl, Nea! I don't know how he made me forget but Allen found the true memory. I didn't kill her, he did. To tame you. You have to believe me before you take other peoples families from them the way he took her from you. It doesn't have to be Innocence versus Noah- we each chose our own battles Nea and you need to chose what is right for you. Do you really want to kill me? I am human. Mother was human. _You _are human. It is our chaos that makes us beautiful. What would a world of akuma be Nea? Imagine that melody\"_\n\n_It saddened him to think of his families blindness. He had grown close to them and they felt as much a part of his flesh as his brother. They were as convinced by the Earls vision as he had been though- more so in fact- and as they had no families, they could not be reached as he had been reached. His love for his humans had shown him their worth but his brothers and sisters loved only each other. Their love was pure and strong and he was part of it too. The thought of their deaths drove him insane but the melody of the world outweighed the song of their love. He wanted to explain- to show them but he didn't want to raise too many alarms. He needed the access to the ark that he had and he wasn't prepared yet for a full battle with them. When the time came, he would give them the choice. He knew that it was a false choice though- was a choice with a predetermined destination truly a choice at all? Nevertheless, he had to try. Offering them options gave them responsibility and him, some peace of mind. His brother understood his pain and both comforted each other with these platitudes repeated over and over again. It wasn't their fault- it was battle_\n\n_The time came too soon. Chords were broken. Melodies ended. Blood rained and his siblings died. Some by his hand, some by Allen's, some by Cross's. It mattered not. The end was the same and his pain was the same. He found Road- the last- clutching his unconscious brother in her arms, her eyes pain filled and her heart poisoned worse than ever. She he had loved most of all. He could feel her melody inside his brothers head and he feared for his soul. The Earl- maddened and raging attacked and he had to leave his brother in her clutches. He fought body and soul but he was not strong enough. Many blows were exchanged but he fell more than half dead to the ground. His friend ran to his body and he knew what he must do. It had been their last resort but all else had failed. His brother had his melody and now his best friend had his soul._\n\n_Flashes of scenes flickered before his eyes and he was aware of time passing. He couldn't understand it. Why hadn't Allen transferred him yet? Or let him have consc..._\n\n_He was in a dream state. Memories were all he had. The present was not speaking with him so his stories were all he had_\n\n_Every once in a while, an emotion flickered through but..._\n\n**Why... why can't I?**\n\n**Where did I go**\n\n**will I get back?**\n\nThe melody flew through his body like it had never left and though he wasn't controlling it, he awoke and his power entered it. The ark began to sing for him as it always did. It had always loved him more than any of the others. Even Road it had only tolerated- but for him... for him she _sang _and her melody was more beautiful than anything in the universe\n\nHe was awake\n\nAt last\n\n\n\t49. Chapter 49\n\nCross Marion slumped down in his chair, his posture aggressively casual- his boots planted on the table and his hat slumped down over his face, shielding his eyes from the scrutiny of the surrounding generals. He had been out with the control of the order for so long that he had almost forgotten exactly how much he _loathed _everything about it. He was not one for following orders. He was a wolf, not a sheep and if there was one thing he hated above everything else, it was those who thought their opinion counted for more than others due to their status. He didn't mind deferring to those who presented a good argument or to those who had some sort of expertise- like that Dumbledore fellow but to have someone of lesser intelligence, lesser experience and lesser talent tell _him _what to do and scrutinise _his _actions. It really rubbed him up the wrong way to say the least.\n\nHe had really rather hoped that things would have turned out slightly differently than they had- though of course he had always known that this was a likely outcome and had a contingency plan in place but still. Had his stupid, useless apprentice been able to reach the piano room more quickly, perhaps the appearance of the 14th could have been masked for slightly longer but no. The stupid, snivelling little snot rag had left it until the last possible second and had reconstructed the entire arc in front of everyone. There was no hiding it now. Damage control was the only way forward. His only hope was that he could distract the order for long enough so the 14th could establish control before these idiots destroyed his host body.\n\nHe figured that they would value the strategic advances the ark offered highly enough that they would spare the boy though knowing the Orders brutality, it was not a guaranteed outcome. He was really hoping he wouldn't have to resort to a jail-break, though to be fair, even if the kid was charged with being a traitor, the Order would probably torture him rather than kill him. He was far to valuable for that so they would try torture and brainwash to turn him into an obedient little sheep, like those detestable Crows. Though there was a risk with that outcome that they would accidental kill him in the process.\n\nThe door behind him opened and the atmosphere of the whole hall changed\n\n_And so it begins _he thought, smiling slightly at the melodrama of it all\n\nIt took roughly 3 minutes for Lvierre and his little pet crow to run through the list of Cross's crimes and to let him off with basically a slap on the wrist and 'Well you had better never do this again'\n\n_They must be really mad at the boy_ Cross thought wryly. He'd hardly had to argue at all there, though he guessed they were crediting him with actually succeeding in capturing the akuma egg and by proxy, the ark. He was rather impressed by the manipulation that had gone into that actually. He had never suspected that Lvierre had know the akuma plant was in the ark when he had sent Cross on that mission. They must have found out, or suspected his affiliation with the 14th though, to be fair, he had never made his hatred of the Order a secret. Still, the fact that they had known and rather than torturing him into oblivion had used this to manipulate him into both capturing the ark and revealing the host of the 14th all in one go, that truly was an achievement.\n\n\"Now that we have both the Akuma egg and the Noah's means of transport, we really have crippled them\" Lvierre was saying, looking so proud you would have almost imagined that he was the one who had captured it\n\n\"The exorcists will be able to use the Ark's transportation powers and so we shall be able to further our battle plans to levels only dreamed of before\"\n\n\"Hold on\" One of the little idiots Cross had never bothered learning the name of spoke up, interrupting Lvierre's soliloquy (Not a very wise move)\n\n\"Won't that just increase the burden on our already strained exorcists? We have received a number of serious blows in recent months and our exorcists are already stretched as it is. Besides, this Ark has been under the control of the Noah for months- what guarantee have we that it is safe to use?\"\n\nThe blonde bimbo continued, his eyes blazing with a steely (if foolish) determination\n\nLvierre gave the blonde man a look of contempt\n\n\"Sacrifices must be made in war. The exorcists are made to fight and fight they will. If they die, they die fulfilling their duty. I will not lose any sleep over it. It is their purpose\" He shrugged one shoulder casually ignoring the drop in temperature in the room, currently filled with the very people he had just reduced to the level of mere pawns. Subtlty had never been his strong point Cross mulled and snapped back to attention as he spoke again\n\n\"The real question is not so much whether we should use the ark but rather what we should do with the boy\"\n\nLooks of confusion darted across the room and Cross tensed. Lvierre's eyes flashed in his direction\n\n\"That ark was made by a certain Noah, was it not, _General Cross_\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I believe it was\" Cross drawled casually staring up at the ceiling\n\n\"The 14th I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes\" Lvierre said curtly, obviously not appreciating Cross's deliberately obtuse attitude\n\n\"And this 14th has not been reborn yet?\"\n\nCross stuck out his bottom lip and shrugged expressively, looking around the room as if expecting the 14th to appear from under the table or something\n\n\"Not that I know of, no\"\n\nThe mood in the room tensed as, one by one, the generals realised what was being insinuated in this exchange\n\n\"Do you not think\" Lvierre spat out from between clenched teeth\n\n\"That it is highly likely that the boy who managed to reload the Ark is the reincarnation of the 14th ?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't know about that\" Cross said casually again, waving his hand dismissively and completely ignoring the room's collective intake of breath at Lvierre's accusation\n\n\"You know how it is, people are capable of great feats when those they love are at ris...\"\n\n* * *\n\n>\"That ark could only have been controlled by a Noah and you know as well as I do that the 14th is the only one who would have been capable of making it listen to him above the Earl as the ark was his creation. Do not play games with me Cross. I know that you found this <em>boy <em>mere months after you were given the assignment to look for the egg and you have been watching him closely ever since, you know as well as I do. Allen Walker is a Noah and as such, he is a traitor and enemy of the Order\"\n\nAllen's eyes were unfocussed, staring unseeing at the grand piano in front of him as he tried to organise the wild jumble of thoughts that were rattling around inside his skull. How had he been able to play that piano? How had he been able to control the ark? Who was that black ominous silhouette skulking in the corners of his vision, looming behind him and disappearing every time he turned, leering over him every time he caught his reflection? As he tried to sort through everything in his head, his hand moved almost subconsciously across the sheet of paper he was balancing on his knees, sketching lines and circles in a complex pattern.\n\nSo. Mana had been the brother of this '14th Noah' who created and controlled the ark. That would explain why Mana knew the secret language of the music for the Ark. Allen smiled ever so slightly as he remembered Mana teaching him that secret language, sketching out the characters with a stick in the snow... but the smile turned bitter. Mana must have known- must have seen it as soon as he saw Allen- the shadow of his thought-to-be-dead brother behind those angry, grey eyes. Had Mana ever, really cared for him at all? Or had his kindness and love been for his brother, rather than Allen himself? That explained as well why Cross had taken such an interest in him, and why he had been given Timcanpy. Everything in his life it felt had been leading him down this path. All those decisions he though he had been making had in reality been made for him. To go with Mana, to change into the man he thought Mana wanted him to be, to fight Akuma, to join the Order. All of these 'decisions' had been leading him down a path already meticulously laid out for him. That mantra of Mana's took on a new meaning and turned sour in his mind\n\n'Keep walking'\n\nAllen's face twisted bitterly. Anger and sorrow broiling up inside him.\n\nThat ideal he had clung to when everything had fallen apart. It no longer meant 'Never give up' or 'make your own way in life' or 'walk the path least trod' or anything so sentimentally pathetic\n\nNo\n\nRather it meant 'what ever you do, do not stray from this path that we have designed for you'\n\nThe bitterness in his heart swole up and its intensity scared him. Mana had been the only person in his life ever to show him kindness and now- now he knew. It had all been a lie. Mana had never cared for him, he had done all he had done for his brother- not for some poor, lost, bratty kid with no parents. Though, thinking about it, Allen wondered if 'he' had ever really existed. His body contained the memories for this Noah, it was just a vessel. Perhaps this person that he though he was didn't really exist. Maybe he was just little pieces of Neah that had slipped through the cracks. Perhaps his real function was just to keep this body until Neah awoke properly and if that was the case, had he ever been real?\n\nEverything in his body hurt. His lungs felt made of sandpaper. His heart was throbbing with each beat and the pain in the back of his throat was building to a near unbearable level. He looked down at the sheet of paper he was holding and an inarticulate cry tore from his throat. He scrunched it up and threw it as far from him as possible then curled up, wrapped his arms around his head, closed his eyes and tried his utmost to stop thinking\n\nThe white sheet of paper rolled onto its side and unfurled slightly, revealing the complex lines and patterns of the 14th 's song\n\nLavi wondered through the pristine white streets of the ark, gazing around in rapture at the unbelievable architecture and resisting the temptation to try each door along the way to see where they all led. This huge construction set his brain whirring with its endless possibilities and he could hardly contain his childish excitement. He had never even dreamed of such a thing existing, let alone that they would commender it for their side! They had really struck a blow to the Noah and for a change, they had some power in their hands. The scales had tipped ever so imperceivable in their favour. It wasn't much, but it sure was the morale boost that they all needed. The only issue was that now, the question had to be asked- how had they been able to steal it from the Noah. Bookman hadn't spoken a word on the subject to Lavi but he was smart enough to fill in the blanks for himself- hence the reason he was currently hiking up the marbled streets to the top of the white citadel. Eventually, he reached the door to the piano room, where he knew he would find Allen. He hesitated for the briefest of moments, wondering what he would find inside, and whether his presence would be welcome. His hand hovered over the handle but then turned it and opened the door relieving the stark white room- Allen was curled up on the sofa, his face pressed into his knees and his arms wrapped tightly around them. His head snapped up when the door opened and for a moment, Lavi saw the grief written plainly across his face but it disappeared as soon as Allen saw who it was, and was replaced by a smile\n\n\"Lavi! You are out of the hospital wing! How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Great\" Lavi grinned, sitting down on the sofa beside him, deliberately slightly too close so their shoulders were just touching to show his silent support.\n\n\"I'm tellin' you though, if that Crowly doesn't wake up soon, he's gonna starve to death. His stomach is rumbling almost as loud as yours does when you miss a meal\"\n\nAllen chuckled and relaxed his arms from around his knees, settling in a cross-legged position.\n\n\"I wonder why they haven't started an NG tube yet\" He mused\n\n\"Oh wait, he only eats akuma blood doesn't he. I forgot. We should go fetch him some, its not like there is a shortage of them or anything\"\n\nLavi laughed in agreement\n\n\"No, that is one thing that we are _not _short of here. Unfortunately, there is the whole poison situation thing though and as much as I love the dude, I ain't gonna go get myself turned to dust so he can get a good meal\"\n\n* * *\n\n>They continued to chat light-heartedly, steering well away from anything to do with the Ark, Cross, or Lvierre and as they spoke, some of the tension left Allen's shoulders and slowly, some of the sadness left his eyes too.<p><p>\n\nLenalee made her way to her brothers office, her usual tray of coffee's balanced expertly on one hand. She had even gone as far as to pick out one of his favourite biscuits- feeling slightly sentimental after having so many close shaves with death. She bumped the door open with her hip and entered with a wide smile. No sooner had she entered the room than her smile froze and her muscles seized up. Lvierre was sitting opposite her brother and she caught the words\n\n\"Walker is a traitor and shall be treated as such\"\n\nShe seemed to have lost control of her body and her legs were shaking so badly she was actually struggling to stay upright. Lvierre turned round in his seat and his leer widened. Shock waves of fear hit her as she saw that familiar expression and it brought back so many memories. She could see Komui's apologetic expression behind Lvierre's head. She knew he was saying something to her but the blood was pounding so loudly through her ears that she couldn't even hear his words. She stuttered out some apology or other and deposited the tray on the nearest table, sloshing the coffee over the rims of the mugs as she did so then spun around on her still malfunctioning legs to escape the office.\n\nShe wondered through the corridors, every nerve buzzing and jittering. Her entire body was in flight mode but her brain was so scrambled she couldn't organise it in any one direction. Eventually, she walked strait into someone's chest and bounced back, landing painfully on the floor. The fall knocked the breath out of her and it took her a moment to gather herself. A hand extended itself into her field of vision and she followed it up with her eyes to see who it belonged to. Kanda stood in front of her, his expression somewhat concerned. She caught his hand and let him pull her upright\n\n\"Sorry\" She muttered\n\n\"I wasn't really looking where I was going\"\n\nKanda said nothing, but simply looked at her. Lenalee swept her hair in behind her ears and gestured generally behind him\n\n\"Well, I had better, you know...\"\n\nKanda put his hand on her shoulder, stopping her in her tracks and, with some effort it seemed said\n\n\"I was going for a walk outside. Do you want to join me?\"\n\nLenalee gaped- as stiff as his words had been, they had actually sounded genuine. She was so shocked however that she completely forgot to respond. Kanda's back stiffened slightly and his lips straitened into a thin line\n\n\"Well. I will see you lat...\"\n\n\"No!\" Lenalee gasped, regaining control over her voice box\n\n\"I'd love to walk. With you. Outside, yes if that is all right with you I mean\" She trailed off slightly awkwardly, mentally kicking herself even as the disjointed words came out of her mouth. Kanda's lips twitched slightly then he nodded and offered her his arm which she gratefully seized, relieved to have something solid to hold onto.\n\nThey walked in silence through the twisted corridors till eventually they exited one of the side doors that opened to a small path that meandered its way precariously down the black cliff. The silence between them started off as awkward with Lenalee's brain whizzing at a thousand miles an hour. As they walked down the path though, her thoughts began to quieten, her concentration shifting from her childhood trauma to maintaining her footing on the uneven, rocky surface and on Kanda's presence and warmth. They manoeuvred their way down the narrow path, still arm in arm, turning diagonally when the path became too narrow for the two to walk beside each other rather than let go of the other's arm. By the time they got to the base of the path, Lenalee's legs had stopped shaking and her fear had calmed to a near-bearable level.\n\nThey wondered along the base of the mountain till they found a flat rock and they both sat down simultaneously. Kanda stared out over the ocean which swept up to crash against the rocks in front of them, showering them in fine mist. His arm relaxed down and Lenalee let hers fall too, glancing up at him to try and judge whether he wanted her to let go or not. She didn't want to, already missing the comforting pressure and his support. In a rush of madness, she let her hand fall down and land on top of his so their arms were still entwined slightly. She flushed darkly and ducked her gaze down to stare at her feet intently in case Kanda turned his head and caught her eye. She felt his hand turn under hers and for a terrible second, she thought he was going to pull away but instead, he entwined their fingers. She lifted her gaze, but this time, Kanda had turned his head away, and she could swear she saw the beginnings of a blush on his pale cheeks. Not wanting to embarrass him, she dropped her head again, her gaze falling on their joined hands. A warm feeling of content bloomed in her chest and she opened her mouth to say something but nothing came out. She wasn't even sure what she wanted to say. Eventually, her words returned to her\n\n\"Thank you\" She whispered- barely audible, her voice seeming to have betrayed her and buggered off somewhere back up that cliff path. There was no response and for a moment she thought he hadn't heard her but then-\n\n\"It's fine. I get it. Lvierre brings out that reaction in most people\"\n\nA cold shard stabbed her heart at the mention of that man's name and silence fell for another few minutes.\n\n\"You were in the order at a young age too weren't you?\" She said. Her voice seemed to have returned slightly. She felt Kanda's hand tense slightly under hers and she wondered what his life had been like. Maybe Lvierre had tortured him too. She knew so little about his life before they had met, and he wasn't exactly all that forthcoming with personal information. All she knew about him really when she thought about it was that he really loved his sword, he _hated _being called Yuu and he preferred to work alone.\n\n\"I was quite young yes. The order took me from my family at roughly seven and trained me from then on. I had no real interaction with Lvierre though if that is what you are asking. Merely with his lackeys\"\n\nLenalee wondered what it had been like for him as a child, to have been taken from his family and trained to be a soldier and such a young age. At least she had Komui to look out for her but perhaps he had never had any one who cared for him. It would certainly explain most of his antisocial tendencies. With a small sigh, she lent against him, dropping her head down onto his shoulder and squeezing his hand slightly\n\n\"How did the fate of the whole world end up relying on a group of messed up kids\" She whispered, a tear tracking down her cheek. She jumped slightly as Kanda reached over and wiped it away, making eye contact for the first time since she face planted into his chest\n\n\"The whole world is messed up\" He said rather gruffly\n\n* * *\n\n>\"We just have to do the best we can with what had been given us. There's not much else we can do\" Having delivered his speech, he turned back again to stare out at the sea and Lenalee buried her head in his side, the tears sliding uncontrollably down her face now. Kanda didn't say anything else and merely waited for her tears to subside before standing again and offering his arm. They walked back up the hill in silence and on reaching the door, in wordless agreement, let go and walked in opposite directions down the corridor of the Order.<p><p>\n\nThe dinner hall was a bustling hub of activity but there was one table being avoided by every one- groaning under the weight of food stacked high. Lenalee made a beeline for it as soon as she entered\n\n\"Hey Allen\" He said, cheerily as she slid into the bench beside him\n\n\"Mind if I steal something\" She gestured toward a tall stack of pancakes hopefully. Allen paused midway through a plate of bacon to scrutinise her carefully. Clearly coming to the decision that he valued her friendship highly enough to allow her some of his food, he nodded graciously, offering her a jug of maple syrup\n\n\"Cheers\" She smiled thoroughly dousing her food before digging in with gusto\n\n\"You are looking awfully cheery\" Lavi observed from Allen's other side, peering curiously at her\n\n\"What's put you in such a good mood?\"\n\n\"What?\" Lenalee said rather defensively \"Amn't I usually cheerful?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah\" Lavi replied carefully \"But just with everything that's been... with... Whatever. I'm glad you've cheered up anyway\"\n\nLenalee flushed slightly and smiled mysteriously, before turning back to her pancakes. Allen and Lavi exchanged perplexed looks\n\n\"What...\" But before Allen could complete his sentence, he was distracted.\n\nA tall, blonde man was standing just to his side, rather officiously, staring at him in a manner which indicated he wished to have his attention but did not wish to be rude\n\n\"Er, Good morning. How may I help you?\" Allen said tentatively, unsure of who this man was or exactly why he was interrupting his morning feast. The odd man saluted Allen and, staring off at a point directly above his head reeled off\n\n\"Good Morning Allen Walker. I am Inspector Link and I have been assigned to you for the foreseeable future. I hope you will cooperate with the Order's inspection\"\n\nHe held out a freshly cooked cherry pie\n\n\"This gift is an offering of goodwill, to facilitate our future partnership\"\n\nAllen's grey eyes lit up at the sight of the delicious pie, and Lavi had to actually grab his wrist to prevent him from digging strait into it\n\n\"Oi! What do you mean investigation?\"\n\nThis questions seemed to snap Allen out of his momentary insanity brought on by the delicious pie with its golden crust and intoxicating smell... shaking his head he focussed on Link\n\n\"Yes, Mister Walker here has been charged with treachery and so is under official investigation to ascertain blame and extract information\"\n\nAllen winced ever so slightly at the use of the word 'extract'\n\n\"What do you mean treachery?\"\n\nLink raised a single eyebrow at his charge and instead of answering, he produced a stack of papers as tall as he was\n\n\"These are to be completed today. I suggest we find more private quarters to fill them out in\"\n\nLavi stood, his face uncharacteristically serious\n\n\"Come on Allen, we can go to the library\"\n\nHe carefully registered the expressions of the finders and exorcists as they watched the three walk out of the diner hall.\n\nTypical Lvierre to do things so publicly. Sowing doubt among the troops was an incredibly effective way of turning them against someone. Outright accusing often would cause outrage but gossip and hints and insinuations... by the end of the week, only those who knew Allen would doubt that he was a traitor and even some of those would potentially be swayed by public opinion. Lvierre was definitely no fool when it came to manipulation.\n\nThey were on their way to the library when Allen ducked suddenly into one of the rooms along the way. He marched up to one of the sofas and dumped the stack of papers he was carrying on the top of Cross's head\n\n\"Oi, idiot, what do you think you are doing?\" The man snapped irritably, twisting around to see Allen glowering down at him\n\n\"Exactly _when _were you going to get round to explaining this all to me\" He shouted, his anger finally bubbling to the surface and breaking through his veneer of calm\n\n\"I am under investigation! I am being called a traitor! What are you... oi!\" Two of the Crows standing guard seized Allen under the armpits and dragged him backwards out of the room\n\n\"You are forbidden from any contact with the general\" One of the soldiers snapped before throwing him out of the room and slamming the door behind him. Allen landed hard on the ground with the papers scattered all around him. He glared furiously at the door and for a moment looked like he was going to try to break the door down but with visible effort, he contained his anger. Instead, he gathered up his papers and stalked down to the library in an ill-tempered fury, completely blanking out Lavi's attempt at light hearted humour. Part way along the corridor, he glanced up at one of the floor length mirrors. His heart jolted painfully in his chest but he forced himself to carry on walking. A hulking black shadow was grinning at him from the reflection. Suppressing a shudder, Allen pushed open the door of the library and settled down to what promised to be a very boring day of paperwork. Link sat directly beside him for an hour solid, watching him as he filled in sheet after sheet of prying questions without making so much as a sound. His grip tightened around the pencil and he accidentally exerted too much pressure, the lead breaking with a loud snap. Link didn't even so much as blink but Lavi looked up from the novel he was reading and saw Allen open his mouth to say something\n\n\"Hey, Allen\" He said hurriedly, trying to stop his friend before he put his foot in it\n\n\"Listen to this. I think I have just found the best book of all time.. here\" He sat down sideways on the bench beside him, leaning back against his arm, pressing back pointedly before relaxing against him.\n\n\"_I'd never given much thought to how I would die-though I'd had reason enough in the last few months-but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. _Dramatic, huh? Wait, it get better...\"\n\nHe continued to read out little excerpt and snippets of the book, throwing in little comments and witty literature analysis every time he thought Allen's temper was beginning to fray\n\n\"Here, _I was wearing my favourite shirt – sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. _How brilliant is that description? See how it draws to attention the weather differences between the place she is leaving and Forks? It re-emphasises her disappointment in moving there- Her favourite top is only suitable for her home state and she would have to add the parka for the outfit to work in Forks- Some serious literature going down here. Hope you are taking notes!\"\n\nAllen let out a half snort, half laugh\n\n\"Seriously, what is that rubbish that you are spouting- surely that isn't actually a _published _book is it?\"\n\nLavi nodded in affirmation holding it out to Allen for inspection\n\n\"I promise you, this is actually published material. Best seller in fact\"\n\nAllen shook his head in disbelief\n\n\"Aaaand I have just lost faith in humanity. Great. Now what am I fighting for?\"\n\nLavi chuckled but their mirth was stunted- Link's cold eyes boring into the backs of their heads, reminding them that everything they said and did was being taken down\n\n\"Just to clarify\" Allen said, somewhat tritely to his guard dog\n\n\"That was a jest. A joke. A pun, if you will. In other words, a sentence intended to make people laugh and in no way was based on any true feelings I have. I do not believe that humans are terrible beings and should all die to be replaced by Noah\"\n\n\"Just perhaps this one\" Lavi butted in, sniggering and waving his book like it was some filthy rag. Link didn't so much as bat an eyelid at their antics and continued to watch the two until they settled back into a mildly uncomfortable silence.\n\nPretty much every interaction the two had in the next few days followed the same pattern. Link would skulk in the corner and watch Allen like a hawk but barely ever spoke and not even Lavi could get a single reaction from him. Allen seemed to have grown used to the man's constant presence and chatted away amicably to him, battling on despite the stony silence or short retorts he received in answer to each attempt at civility.\n\n\"Hey Link, you should really try these blueberry muffins. I have no idea what it is that Jerry does to them but they taste like perfection muffin-ified. I promise\"\n\nSilence\n\n\"Here\" He offered one of his muffins to Link as Lenalee and Lavi watched in stunned silence- Allen was offering someone else his food? Of his own free will? What was going on in this crazy, crazy world? Even Link seemed somewhat surprised and stiffly accepted the muffin with a curt\n\n\"Thanks\"\n\nAllen grinned widely, looking very pleased at having finally elicited a response\n\n\"No problem\"\n\nOne of the exorcists walking down the isle, preoccupied by balancing his precariously stacked tray of food glanced up when Allen spoke and suddenly realised where he was, shock registering on his face. He did a sharp about turn, almost dropping all of his food in the process and scurried backwards, taking a long detour to avoid passing their table. He sat down with a group at the far end and muttered something.\n\nAn awkward atmosphere settled over the table. They all had seen what had happened and they all knew why it had happened\n\n\"Chauji really doesn't like me huh\" Allen said softly as Chauji spoke loudly from the far off table of exorcists. The words \"Traitor... Noah... Walker\" drifted over and Allen shook his head, smiling sadly\n\n\"I just wish I could explain things to him without him flipping out but he really has got it set in his head that I am evil. I mean I know it is just misplaced anger from the whole Anita thing but... well, I just wish I could explain to him why I didn't just kill Tyki\" He sighed and shook his head\n\n\"Never mind. It's fine\"\n\nTears brimmed in Lenalee's huge eyes as she watched her friend and with a sudden burst she reached over and engulfed him in a huge hug\n\n\"I'm sorry Allen\" She cried squeezing him so tight the air was driven right out of his lungs. Allen's eyes, wide with sock locked onto Lavi's who sniggered childishly. Lenalee eventually let go and Allen wheezed out a thank you, massaging his bruised ribs.\n\n\"Oh hey there Kanda\" Lenalee said, smiling widely but the blue-haired samurai-wanabe swept past them without so much as a backwards glance. Lenalee dropped the hand she had raised in welcome and her face fell.\n\n\"Oh\" She said softly then smiled brightly again as if nothing had happened\n\n\"You know\" Allen said carefully\n\n\"As annoying as BaKanda is, I feel the need to point out that for someone as reserved and socially inept as him, hugging someone is the emotional equivalent of making out. Not that I am insinuating that you two are in any way interested in each other but you know... if you _were _he probably wouldn't respond well to you hugging another guy. Particularly me\" He shrugged one shoulder casually. Lenalee's eyes widened in realisation and she jumped to her feet\n\n* * *\n\n>\"Tell him I said anything and I will actually kill you\" he yelled after her as she fled the scene \"Can't have him knowing I willingly helped him\" He muttered turning back to his food \"I'd never live it down\"<p><p>\n\n* * *\n\n>The peace that settled over the Order as usual was too good to last. They had only begun to recover from their last battle; Komui was repairing Lavi's weapon, Lenalee had been relieved of her 'dark boots', Crowly was still in the hospital wing along with a collection of other finders and exorcists. Allen had reached the acceptance phase with his constant companion and had finally convinced the Order to allow him to visit Mai and the rest of the wizards to update them on his survival and to corroborate his story to the Order. Much to his and Lavi's delight, Lenalee was spending increasing amounts of time meditating with Kanda (Komui had yet to catch on to this budding romance). Things had just reached an even keel when, mid-way through breakfast, Allen's eye activated. He leapt up with a cry, dishes clattering to the ground around him as he ran out of the hall, Lavi, Bookman and Link hot on his heels. They skidded to a halt outside the room where the science division had been conducting experience on the Akuma egg. A huge black gate, not dissimilar to the one's Neah's ark created was blocking their progress. Allen activated his innocence and struck a blow to the door but it barely made a dent<br>\"Lavi- alert the exorcists\" He shouted, closing his eyes tight, summoning a blazing white door with the number '3' etched into its front  \n>\"Tell them Noah have invaded the Order and have the science division trapped. This door leads into the room. Bookman and I are going in now. Hurry!\" Lavi took off at a sprint and glanced back, to see his friend, his mentor and Link disappear one by one through the white light.<p><p>\n\n* * *\n\n>Allen watched in horror as a black mass worked its way over Bookman's face- he didn't have any idea what the Akuma had done to him but it looked as if he was slowly being poisoned. He struggled futility against the Akuma holding him and glared furiously at Lulabell who was watching his efforts, a snide smirk on her face<p>\"Did you really think you had any chance fighting us with just the two of you? How arrogant you-\"<br>There was a loud crack as Allen wrenched himself out of the grip of the Akuma with a sudden effort and dissaperated in front of her, re-materialising beside Bookman.  \n>He sliced through the black strands that had strung him up to the wall and lowered him to the ground before de-materialising with another 'crack' and appearing on top of the egg which was slowly disappearing into the black gate Lulabell had summoned. The Noah snapped her head around, an expression of disbelief on her face but she wasn't able to follow him, lest she too be sucked into the black gate<p>\n\n\"Arresto Momentum\" Allen yelled, his feet mere centimetres away from the inky surface that was devouring the egg inch by inch. Its progress slowed slightly. He waved his wand again and thick cords sprung from his wand tip, looping around the egg and leaping up to the rafters and pillars, wrapping around them and anchoring the egg. There was an ominous creaking noise as the opposing forces fought over control.  \n>Allen cast a levitating charm, a feather weight charm and every other spell that came to mind to try and pull the egg back to the surface. Lulabell roared in anger and Akuma after Akuma shot at him. Allen spun around but it was too late- he closed his eyes in anticipation of the blow the formost Akuma was throwing at him but the blade never hit. He opened his eyes to see Cross, Miranda, Marie and Tiedol outlined sharply against the white light of his gate. The generals had joined the battle.<br>Allen watched in wide eyed shock as the sliced through the remaining Akuma as if they were nothing. Tiedol summoned a series of vines which wrapped and writhed around the group of injured scientists, forming a solid wall of vegetation which looked surprisingly impenetrable. Miranda cast one of her shields around him and the egg he was straddling and he heard her cry  \n>\"Reverse!\"<p>\n\nSlowly but surely, the egg began to rise bit by bit out of the black surface. Allen spun around but Lulabell had disappeared from sight. He climbed down off the egg, the adrenaline buzzing through his veins. He stumbled over the rubble scattered over the ground to join the generals in clearing off the remaining Akuma. The department was a crumbling mess of destruction and it took a while to pick out all of the science division members, dead and alive and ushered the ones still capable of moving out of the room.\n\nThere was a loud cry and Allen's stomach jerked. Not again. He turned to see Miranda suspended mid-air in a ball of water  \n>\"Lulabell\" Cross spat bitterly, activating his innocence again<br>\"She can transform into anything\"\n\nAllen watched in horror as Miranda lost control and the egg began to sink back down. The generals launched a barrage of attacks on it trying to destroy it before it sunk completely and returned to the Earl. Allen shot a bubblehead charm through the sphere of water and (after a few attempts) succeeded in hitting Miranda. A bubble formed around her head and shoulders providing fresh air, and he was relieved to see her spluttering and coughing up the water that had filled her lungs. The eggs descent slowed slightly again. Lulabell snarled as cracks began to criss-cross over its surface, the general's attacks finally making an impact on the device. She swung Miranda's weakly struggling body down and pressed it against the egg  \n>\"If you want to destroy it you will have to kill her too\" She cackled madly.<p>\n\nAllen turned to the generals wide-eyed but saw clearly in their fiercely determined faces that they were not going to stop to save the life of one exorcist. In desperation, Allen dissaperated once again, materialising over Miranda, shielding her with his own body and simultaneously driving his innocence deep into the egg as it was completely submerged in the black gate.  \n>He could feel Miranda struggling weakly beneath him which at least was a sign that the bubblehead charm had worked and she was still alive. Allen forced his blade deeper into the eggs surface, desperately hoping against all hope that it would shatter before he suffocated. The cracks spidering out from beneath his blow widened and with a splintering noise, the egg shattered., the noise of it breaking mixing with Lulabells tortured screams. With a wrench, Allen felt his body being jerked back to the surface as Miranda gained enough consciousness to pull them back up with her innocence. She promptly fainted as they reached the surface and her body went slack in Allen's arms. He checked her pulse and was relieved to feel it throbbing steadily, if rather faintly beneath his fingers<p>\n\n\"Good shot\" He threw casually at Cross as he straitened, Miranda cradled in her arms  \n>\"Knew you'd be fine\" Cross replied equally flippantly, throwing Allen a smile.<br>Allen grinned internally, surprised and slightly pleased that the man- for all his insults and snide comments, actually believed in him. At least a little.\n\nAllen deposited Miranda's limp body inside the ark door, figuring she'd be safe there at least till they could take her to the hospital bay. Something was still bothering him, his eye was twinging insistently and there was a deep sense of unease, born from years of fighting, bubbling up in his stomach. Something was still not right. He knew the generals could feel it too- no one was celebrating what appeared to be a win on their side. Tension still clung to the air.\n\nAllen scaled the huge chunks of rubble that had fallen from the ceiling as the egg had pulled huge chunks of the pillars down with it. Lvierre was gonna be _pissed_. He waved his wand as he went, and a gust of air swept from it, cutting through the thick white fog that was pouring from the Akuma corpses. As it cleared the area in front of him, he recoiled in horror.  \n>The floor was stained black with blood- the corpses of finders and scientists lying decapitated and twisted in the ever-spreading stain. One of the finders reached out to him even as the pentagons spread over his skin<br>\"It... the akuma... it _evolved\" _he gasped before the poison overtook his system and he dissolved into black ash.\n\nAllen raised his eyes and out of the clearing fog, a hideous Akuma appeared- its body child-like but twisted. Wrong. Allen's eyes however were not on the physical body but rather on the soul attached to it. A wave of nausea hit him so hard it took the air from his lungs and he fell, emptying the contents of his stomach on the ground. He could barely force himself to look back up again and it took all of his strength not to close his eyes. It hurt to look at that soul. Hurt physically. Every beat of his heart brought a new wave of the pain. Searing and sickening. _How could this abomination even exist_\n\nThe creature giggled as it approached him. He could feel it coming closer but he couldn't look, couldn't see that twisted, tortured-  \n>\"Hey mister, are you crying?\" the Akuma asked- its voice distorted and its speech childish<br>He could feel it getting closer but he couldn't do it. He couldn't look. A hand enclosed around his wrist and he leapt in shock. One of the scientists was still alive- Jonny- he was shaking, covered in blood but alive. He was still alive.  \n>\"Help up\" he gasped, his eyes brimming with tears and his voice trembling with terror<br>\"You've got to help us Allen. Save us. Save us!\"  \n>Allen surged to his feet, drawing his blade, his eyes narrowed and he stared defiantly at the Akuma as he turned to face it<br>\"I _will _destroy you, level 4!\"\n\n* * *\n\n>Link ran through the white streets of the ark, pausing for a second at the door as he saw the innate body of Miranda Lotto- the new exorcist- wielder of the time altering innocence. She was alive, breathing shallowly but alive. She was not his task anyway. He ran through the blazing white door and entered a scene of terrible destruction. The Generals were engaged in fighting an Akuma the likes of which he had never seen before. A level 4 he assumed. New evolutions, this was a sign of the end-of-days. He moved on, searching for his charge. It took him a few moments to locate the inert form of the teen, lying face down on the landing two floors up. He reached the boy's unconscious form with difficulty as many of the stairs had been destroyed. The boys invocation had deactivated and instead of the distinctive white coat, he was once again garbed in his exorcist uniform. Link turned his body round and roughly shook his shoulders. The boy's white lashes flickered and his grey eyes slowly flickered open, his pupils focussing and defocussing as he struggled to maintain consciousness.<br>\"This is not the time to sleep\" Link said firmly to his charge as he sat up slightly, his small body dwarfed by Link's  \n>\"We need you to fight\"<br>Allen turned to look back at the battle field  \n>\"Bookman...\" he gasped, his voice weak \"Cross... Tiedol...\"<br>Link raised his gaze too and gaped at the destruction- surely, surely the Generals had not so soon been defeated?\n\nLavi glared at the charge nurse who was staring him down, her hands on her hips and nostrels flaring  \n>\"Get. Back. In. Your. Bed\" She spat, fury vibrating through every word<p>\n\nLavi was standing almost nose-to-nose with her in front of the huge oak doors that were seperating him and Lenalee from the rest of the Order. Lenalee was hanging around uncertainly behind him, clearly struggling internally with her brothers orders to stay and her desire to help her friends. There was another series of crashes and booms from beyond the door. Someone screamed and the entire structure shook\n\n\"Let me out right now\" Lavi yelled, all thoughts of politeness out the window\n\n\"People are _dying _out there. My friends are _dying. _LET ME OUT\"\n\nHe tried to push the matron aside but she grabbed his arm and shook him, like he was some naughty child\n\n\"What do you think you are going to do?\" She said, her voice intense but intreating. Her eyebrows were drawn together in an inverted 'v' and all of a sudden, she looked very old and very tiered\n\n\"You have no weapon, no way to defend yourself. I know you want to help, I know you do but you _can't. _You simply can't. Don't you understand? Your innocence is still under repair, if you joined the battle you would be no help to anyone. The best thing you can do is stay here and wait for it to end then try your best to help\"\n\nLavi wrenched himself from her grip, breathing heavily but some of his fury had cooled\n\n\"I can't just wait\" He wailed, suddenly feeling more vulnerable than he had ever felt before\n\n\"I can't just sit here while they die. I can't. Let me go please, I'll find my innocence, I'll make it work somehow. I can't just sit here while Allen and Bookman and all my friends are out there _dying _to protect me!\"\n\nThe matron straitened her back, her face visibly ageing\n\n\"Welcome to my world\" She said, somewhat bitterly\n\n\"Please\" Lenalee said, reaching forward to catch both of the matrons hands in her own\n\n\"I promise, all we will do is visit Hevlaska. If she can give us our innocence back, we will fight and if not we won't. We're no safer here than there and I swear to you we will not join the battle unless we can defend ourselves\" Her voice hummed with emotion and the Marton visible wavered then in a smooth motion, moved aside\n\n* * *\n\n>\"Please, don't die\" She whispered as they ran past her, through the door and into the pandemonium of the Order<p><p>\n\n* * *\n\n>Lenalee lay gasping on the cold metal grating, fear like she had never felt before in her life coursing through her body. Hevlaska leant towards her and deposited the innocence in her hands. It liquefied as soon as it made contact with her skin and all of a sudden, she knew exactly what she had to do. Kanda was fighting somewhere back up on the upper floors, protecting all those people he claimed to hate with weapon after weapon as each shattered beneath his power. Lavi too was battling with his barely formed innocence, and was already injured. Allen was somewhere high above her throwing himself recklessly at the Akuma, so severely beaten she wondered how he was even moving. Lvierre stood, separate from all the chaos and pain, observing her with hooded eyes as she raised her cupped hands to her lips, comforted by Komui's arms around her. This was for him. For Kanda. For Allen. For Lavi. She could do it again. She could take the pain, could take the weight on her legs again. Could take the fighting if only, if only they could be saved.<br>She would give her all if it meant her loved ones living another day  \n>In a swift motion, she tipped the innocence into her mouth and swallowed. The familiar, obliterating pain pulsed through her body and a black substance burst from her heels, trickling down her ankles, like black blood.<br>Above her innate form, Allen was battling furiously with the level 4. He blocked one of its attacks with his blade. The energy pushed back powerfully against him and his arms trembled as his innocence shook. A cry tore from his lips as he struggled to hold the surge of energy back and all of a sudden, two hands encircled his. One from Kanda and the other, Lavi. Both boys gripped his arm, strengthening it and linked arms behind his back, joining their power together and pushing back against the Akuma. With a swift movement, Allen twisted the blade and defleacted the beam off. All three of the boys fell forward as the pressure suddenly disappeared- Allen's cloak caught him before he could land on the floor, and as a result, the next blow from the Akuma hit him directly in the chest and he flew through the air. The Akuma was above him in a split second. It gripped him by his coat and pulled his limp form closer to its deformed and _wrong _face. Before it could decapitate him, or gloat, or do whatever the hell it was planning on doing however, Lenalee landed with bone-shattering force between Allen and the Akuma. Black boots once again encircling her legs  \n>\"You don't get to touch my friends\" She spat venemously<br>\"You don't get to ruin my home. You have no right\"  \n>And in one swift movement, she was soaring, Allen's beaten body clutched in her arms<br>\"I couldn't save everyone\" He gasped  \n>\"I am so sorry\"<p>\"Yeah, I'm sorry it took me so long to come help too but I am here now and between you and me, there's no way this punk is walking out of here, so lets join forces, OK?\"<p>\n\nAllen smiled that simple, genuine smile of his that she so rarely saw, but so appreciated  \n>\"Yeah. Let's do this\" He said, and as one, they charged<p>\n\nAllen's heavy eyes opened again and this time, they stayed open of their own accord. With surprise, he found that he could move his arms without anywhere near as much pain as he had felt previously. As he slowly woke, he noticed a small piece of paper pinned to the pillow beside his head  \n>'<em>I dug through that weird belt of yours and found this cool little box of potions. Had a chat with Kanda and after looking through that potions book of yours I figured out which ones to use for what. Hope you don' t mind too much and even if you do, you're still pretty beat up. I am confident I could take ya! Hope you're feelin' a bit more human (pun intended :-P) -L<em>\n\nAllen chuckled which made his head hurt a little. He lay for a while, dozing slightly and allowing the magic to work its course through his veins with mild impatience.\n\nIt took a hours before he was capable of standing on his incredibly shaky legs. It took a few hours more than that to convince the matron that he really was healed.  \n>Having finally convinced her to let him out, he waded his way through the rubble and destruction to the cool white ark, a sense of familiarity and content washing through his stomach as he entered.<br>Allen made his way to the piano room, holding the door open for his tall, blonde shadow. He had barely even noticed his standing up and following from the hospital wing, he had grown so used to the man's presence. He quickly explained his plan to Link and when he neglected to stop him, or call down the mighty wrath of Lvierre, he sat down at the piano and began to play.\n\nWith the added power of Dumbledore on their team, the Order began to take shape again rather more speedily than it would have otherwise. Allen was less shocked than he perhaps would have been before the disastrous events of the past few weeks to find that Dumbledore was now on the run and Umbridge... _Umbridge _was running the school. After receiving this news, Allen began to feel like he had actually been the lucky one out of his friends by getting out before that Toad could take over.\n\nSoon he had five well established rooms that he more or less spent the next 3 weeks darting between- Three led to different landscapes- a thick forest, a deserted tundra and a sun baked tropical island. He gathered the majority of his potion ingredients from these rooms. The fourth, led to this newly established potions lab which always had at least three cauldrons bubbling away at any one time, producing batch after batch of healing potions. Lavi appeared fascinated by potion making and proved rather invaluable. Although he couldn't actually _add_ any of the ingredients, or stir the cauldron because he didn't have magical blood, he prepared all of the ingredients and kept a track of each potion, contacting Allen through the gold earring Komui had given him every time one of the potions was ready for the next batch of ingredients. The 5th room was his favourite though, and led to the Burrow, where Mai was currently being cared for by Molly Weasly. He barely even saw Dumbledore who had spent most of his time stratigising alternately with Cross, the Order of the Phoenix, Komui and even Lvierre on occasion. He had disappeared into the board room with the intimidating man and had not reappeared for almost a full day. When he did emerge, he strode out of the room without so much as a glance backwards. His face was stoney and something about the light in his eyes spelt out silent fury. Lvierre seemed equally dissatisfied with how the meeting had gone, though he was a bit less dignified in his fury, slamming the door hard behind him and snapping at his Crows to follow him.\n\nOnce the Order was back up and running however, it was back to business. The fires went out from beneath the cauldrons and Allen developed a chronic tension headache that would not quit. He was now being expected to coordinate with every single branch of the order, opening and closing gates as they required it while simultaneously joining the Black Order's exorcists on their missions. Not to mention that undercurrent of strain that had ignited when he first played the opening chords of the 14th's song.\n\nAfter all the madness of the past few months, all he could think about was speaking to Mai again. He had visited her on a number of occasions through the Ark however, he really didn't feel much like making another trip with Link noting his every word. Time to try out Sirius's present he figured. One of the few times he could escape from Link was when he was unconscious in the hospital wing- Link usually used these opportunities to write up his notes, or report to Lvierre, or do whatever the heck it was Crows did. Allen pretended to sleep till the nurse went to change the dressings on Crowly then he slid out of his bed and crept out of the ward, grabbing a blanket as he did so to wrap around his shoulders. He padded through the corridors, the stone floors cold beneath his bare feet. The order was completely deserted, and he didn't come across anyone on his way to his room. He emerged moments later, changed into his uniform clutching a golden mirror which glinted in his hand. He deliberately avoided the lower levels, where he assumed everyone was gathered and instead wondered till he found a deserted room somewhere in the labyrinth of corridors.\n\nHe settled down on the floor and turned the mirror to face himself, his pale reflection coming into view. He was rather surprised as to how ill he looked. His face was three shades whiter than usual which provided a delightful contrast for the deep blue bags under his eyes and the yellowing bruise that was climbing up the side of his cheek. Wishing for a moment that he was a girl and had access to concealer, Allen spoke to the mirror- reflecting that the gift would have been a whole lot more useful if he had been giver slightly clearer instructions on how to use it\n\n\"Mai Walker\" He said, feeling rather stupid. Nothing happened. Perhaps it only answered to the owner?\n\n\"Sirius Black\" He said questioningly. Nothing. Allen sighed rather impatiently\n\n\"Molly Weasly?\" Still nothing.\n\nHe began to grow more uncomfortable, looking at his pale reflection with the ever-present black shadow in the background. An ill-gotten thought entered his head that at that moment in time, the black shadow of Neah looked more solid than he did. He shook his head firmly and banished the thought to the darkest recesses of his mind\n\n\"Harry Potter\" Allen said firmly to the hand mirror which stubbornly reflected back his own face\n\n\"Ha-ry Po-tter\" He annunciated loudly but nothing happened. He dropped the mirror to the ground and rubbed his hands over his face, toying with the idea of going back down to his room. He was exhausted. He was just about to leave when a voice emitted from the mirror\n\n\"Sirius!?\"\n\nAllen snatched it up, recognising the voice immediately\n\n\"Harry\" he exclaimed excitedly, pleased to see his friends face in the glass rather than his own. Harry's face fell\n\n\"Oh. It's you\"\n\n\"Cheers\" Allen said, slightly taken aback but the teasing note very quickly disappeared from his voice when he got a good look at Harry's face\n\n\"What's going on there Harry? What's wrong?\"\n\nThe image on the mirror was wavering wildly as Harry moved around the dorm room, clearly very shaken\n\n\"I... I thought you were Sirius. Sorry mate, I am glad you're ok but I need... I gotta go\"\n\n\"Oi wait!\" Allen shouted as Harry made to drop the mirror back in his trunk. He was all of a sudden on his feet and his heart was thumping as the panic from his friend infected him\n\n\"Tell me what is wrong\"\n\n\"Voldemort has Sirius in the Ministry of Magic\" Harry said tersely, his voice hurried\n\n\"I saw it in one of my... visions. He's torturing him\" his voice broke slightly there\n\n\"I'm going to get him\" He said firmly. He moved toward the trunk again and Allen shouted\n\n\"Wait, wait half a second! You can't just... you... OK fine\" Harry's expression clearly told him he was not going to wait for anyone\n\n\"Fine, go, but I am coming too ok? I'll be there all right? I'll wait for you\"\n\nHarry's face swung from anxiety to gratitude\n\n\"You don't have to\" He protested half-heartedly\n\n\"I really appreciate this Allen. See you there\"\n\nThe mirror went black and Allen's reflection returned. He stood, for a second, trembling slightly, not quite able to believe what had just happened. It didn't make any sense. How on earth could Voldemort have Sirius? What would be the point in capturing and torturing Black? The only possible reason Voldemort could possibly have for taking Sirius would be to use him as bait for the person he really wanted... Harry.\n\n* * *\n\n>\"Sirius Black\" Allen said desperately at the mirror but nothing changed. He wavered for another moment before making up his mind. Even if this was a trap, Harry was going and he had to be there for his friend. He tucked the mirror inside his jacket and took off at a run down the corridor toward the Ark.<p><p>\n\nAllen sprinted down the corridor, his arms pumping as he skidded and swung around the corners. He almost fell as he leapt down the stairs 10 steps at a time and was powering up the corridor to the white door of the ark, feeling the pull of the piano room as he got closer. With a sudden and painful thud, he was knocked off his feet and found himself lying face down on the floor with a crushing weight on his back and his arm twisted at a painful angle.\n\n\"Allen Walker, you are under arrest for the murder of Marion Cross and the betrayal of the Order. Resist arrest and we will use any force necessary to detain you\"\n\nAllen struggled to draw breath, his lungs refusing to inflate after being forcibly emptied by the full body weight of whatever Crow had tackled him landing on his back. He struggled against the two stony-faced guards that were dragging him down to god-knows-where. He had to get to Harry, but he couldn't apperate with the guards holding on to him. They reached a room somewhere down in the depths of the order- a place he didn't recognise. He was thrown bodily into a chair and two more Crows appeared from the shadows, fastening chains around his wrists binding him to the chair and wrapping other chains with strange symbols around his chest. Lvierre entered the room and closed the door behind him with a snap. He grinned widely at Allen and sat down in the chair facing him\n\n\"Well now, so you are a Noah, a traitor _and _a murderer. How we are moving up in the world Allen\" Allen shook his head, non-plussed\n\n\"I.. I don't know what you are talking about. Who is dead?\"\n\n* * *\n\n>\"Your mentor. Your <em>master. <em>Marion Cross\"\n\n\"What\" Allen said blankly, his mind simply not comprehending the words Lvierre had just spoken.\n\n\"I said Marion Cross is dead. You killed him\" He lent back in his chair casually, a self-satisfied smile on his face as he peered over the tips of his fingers at the small figure in front of him. This situation could hardly have worked out any more fortuitously if he had planned it himself. Cross was gone and now he had the 14ths vessel in his grasp with no one to interfere\n\n\"I didn't kill him\" Allen said blankly, staring wide-eyed and disbelieving at Lvierre\n\n\"Why would I kill him? Also when? You've had Link following me ever moment of every day. Unless you are worried _he _had something to do with it too- worried your own men are turning ag-\"\n\nWith sudden violence, Lvierre backhanded Allen across the face. His head snapped around with the force of the blow\n\n\"You do not get to speak to me in that manner\" He growled, his voice surprisingly calm- mismatching weirdly with his violence. Allen turned slowly to face Lvierre again, licking the blood from his split lip\n\n\"I did not kill my master\" He repeated, annoyed by the tremor in his voice.\n\nThe questioning ran in circles.\n\nLvierre- We are well aware of your... difficult relationship with Cross\n\nAllen- _Everyone _had a 'difficult' relationship with Cross.\n\nLvierre -You had plenty opportunity. The attack on the Order was a month ago now.\n\nAllen- Ask Link, he'll tell you exactly where I have been every second of every day\n\nLvierre- We know you have _magic _(this word was spat out with contempt) His testament is not infallible considering your... powers\n\nAllen didn't answer this, suddenly remembering what the fear and shock had driven from his mind- Harry! All of a sudden he realised that the Crows had let go of his shoulders and were currently lurking somewhere behind Lvierre. He knew that this was probably a bad decision, running would more or less attain to a full confession but his friend was in danger, he had to go. He could straiten out this whole thing when he got back. Besides, Lvierre didn't exactly look like he was planning on taking his story into consideration at all. Allen twisted in his chair suddenly, concentrating hard on the deserted shop front that covered for the Ministry of Magic's entrance. He felt the familiar sensation of being forced through a tight rubber tube, but something went wrong. Ever atom in his body felt like it was being pulled apart and with a deafening 'snap' the pressure intensified then disappeared, leaving him still staring into Lvierre's eyes, his ears ringing painfully. Blood began to trickle out of his nose, mouth and ears and dripped onto his chest. The chains that had been wrapped around his chest glowed white hot and then cooled. Lvierre grinned\n\n\"You will not escape me so easily\" He hissed triumphantly  \n>\"Those wards will hold you in place until you have answered Every. Last. One of my questions \"<p>\n\nAllen started suddenly as a muffled voice emitted from his jacket\n\n\"Harry? Allen? Was one of you calling me? Why is the mirror black?\"\n\nIt was Sirius\n\nLvierre and the two Crows were staring around the room in confusion  \n>\"Sirius\" Allen yelled, hoping he would be able to hear him<p>\n\n\"Harry has gone to the ministry of magic- he thinks Voldemort has you prisoner. You have to mmhmph\" One of the Crows shoved his hand over Allen's mouth and the other dug through his jacket looking for the source of the voice. He pulled the mirror out and stared at it uncomprehendingly. Sirius's confused face stared out of the mirror\n\n\"What are you talking about? What's going on? Allen- are you okay?\"\n\nAllen bit down hard on the Crow's hand and he let go with a yell\n\n\"Don't worry about me you idiot- Harry has gone to the ministry, its a trap, you need to get the Order and go get him\" He ducked and struggled as the Crow tried to shut him up again. The other one was shaking the mirror and searching it as if hoping to find an 'off' switch. Lvierre growled in anger and snatched it from his hand, then dashed it against the floor, shattering it. Sirius's face reflected back at Allen, fragmented and scattered across the ground\n\n\"I don't...\" He started\n\n\"GO\" Allen roared as the Crow took off his jacket and tried to stuff the material into his mouth. Sirius's eyes widened and then he nodded and disappeared. The shards of glass reflected back the dull room and Allen breathed a sigh of relief. Sirius would sort it all out. Now all he had to do was survive the questioning\n\nAllen tugged and pulled against the metal bands that encircled his wrists. Periodically, his head would drop onto his chest and each time, he jerked back upright, blinking hard. Harry. Cross. Ron. Mai. Hermione. Lvierre. Link. Their faces kept flashing before his face every time he closed his eyes. His brain was jumping from half-formed thought to half-formed thought exhaustingly\n\nHe'd promised that he would be-\n\nWhat if there had been an ambus-\n\nHe missed her smi-\n\nHad Cross really died? Wh-\n\nWhy were they questioning him? They knew he wasn't to blame for Cr-\n\nHis head slumped down again and this time it didn't rise again\n\nAllen wondered through a black and white landscape, his feet taking him where he wanted to go automatically- as if he knew the place already. He came to a clearing, the black figure he had come to know so well standing out starkly against the white ground. He stopped a few feet in front of the figure, all of a sudden uncertain.\n\n\"Well hello there Allen\" The figure said, his voice wasn't what Allen had expected. Soft and silky, his accent had a faint lilt to it, almost sing-song like\n\n\"What're you doing here?\"\n\nAllen gaped wordlessly\n\n\"Though I guess you do have a right to be here too. In a manner of speaking\"\n\nHe took a step forwards, looming tall over Allen, grinning widely.\n\n\"Not that your stay will last much longer, my little stowaway\"\n\nAllen's feet were glued to the ground. It was like every nightmare ever. He couldn't run, couldn't move, couldn't so much as break eye contact. This figure had him transfixed, like a deer in the headlights. The figure seemed to grow, or he shrunk\n\n\"Who _are _you?\" The voice rumbled- losing some of its softness\n\nAllen tried desperately to wake up, to get away. The figure reached out a hand to touch him and fear pulsed through his body\n\n\"Why are you so young?\" The voice asked, its hand stopping short of Allen's cheek, pausing for a moment then moving again. Allen felt the warmth from his palm, felt it's heat and-\n\nHe jerked awake with a cry of fear, leaping to his feet before the chains encircling him caught him painfully by the wrists and neck. He landed on the cold stone floor with a painful thud, his heart thundered in his chest as Timcanpy watched in concern from the corner\n\nHad that been... could that figure have been... Neah?\n\n\n\t50. Chapter 50\n\nFilthy brown water streamed in through a gaping hole in the ceiling of the Order. The concrete dust coated every surface and seemed to have smothered all the sound in the room. Mere moments ago, the entire room had been reverberating with yells but now all eyes were on the lone figure in the centre of the room. Allen lowered his wand from pointing to the ceiling and levelled it with Lvierre and the onlooking exorcists. He silently cast the protegro charm and froze in place, his other arm extended behind him, and his muddied cloak spread out at his subconscious command, protecting the inert forms of Alma and Kanda. Adrenaline surged through his veins and his whole body was thrumming with the energy. He felt invincible and the feeling frightened him. All eyes were on him and even Lvierre was wrong-footed, his power momentarily sapped by Allen's actions.\n\n\"Allen, what are you going to do?\" Lavi whispered, his warm breath ghosting over Allen's face. He was trembling with fear, and in the background, he saw Bookman- who inclined his head ever so slightly. The approval just worsened the sickening feeling in Lavi's stomach. Bookman surely thought that he had given Allen the wand to gain his trust, to get further recordings, but the truth...\n\nWhatever had triggered his foolish decision to steal Allen's wand from the science lab where Lvierre had locked it away, it certainly hadn't been any form of bookman logic. Nor had it been some ploy to get into Allen's good graces, or to follow him in the hopes of recording more valuable information on the 14th. No. There had been no rationality behind his thinking. The fear of Allen's death had spurred his decision and this thought, this terrible thought, scared him.\n\nAllen averted his eyes from the exorcists, who were still frozen in shock. His silvery eyes met Lavi's green one.\n\n\"I am going to summon the ark\" He breathed, hardly moving his lips\n\n\"When I do, I need you to help me get their bodies in. You'll have to come too, or the order will hurt you for helping me. Do you understand?\"\n\nLavi nodded wordlessly. Something had changed. Something small but fundamental and he found himself, like everyone else watching Allen and waiting to see what he would do, what he would say. Allen took a step towards the Order and spoke again, this time, his voice carrying clearly across the room\n\n\"I am leaving the Order. But I don't want to do so without explaining my actions. I know all of you have lost many friends and allies. I don't want my departure to be taken as my abandoning the cause. I am not giving up, I am not surrendering. I am going to continue to fight this battle, _our _battle but I can no longer do so as part of this organisation. I do not fight for The Order, or for Lvierre, I fight for humanity, I fight for free will and therefore I cannot in good conscious continue as part of this company. Lvierre\"\n\nhe focussed his gaze sharply on Lvierre and his tone hardened\n\n\"The crimes you have committed against humanity are comparable to the crimes committed by the Noah. I understand that in times of war, things become more complex however if you save humanity by losing your own, then the Noah win regardless of the outcome of this war\"\n\nWith a flicker of his mind, he connected with the ark, the familiar tune coursing through every particle of his body. He simultaneously closed all outlying doors and opened a single, blazing white one behind his back. Lavi started forwards and picked up the impossibly light body of Alma as Allen stooped to pick up Kanda. Together, they entered the door and it dissipated instantly behind them, leaving nothing but a blazing imprint on the eyelids of onlookers.\n\n**Oo0ooOoo0oo**\n\nThe door opened into the room Allen had been using to brew potions for the order. The walls were lined from floor to ceiling with shelves full of multicoloured bottles and vials. Kanda stirred slightly in Allen's arms, then, coming to consciousness began to struggle in earnest\n\n\"Put me down, baka\" he snapped, struggling to see what had happened\n\n\"Shut up and stay still\" Allen retorted sharply, depositing Kanda on a bed. Kanda immediately tried to get up but Allen grabbed his shoulders and pushed him firmly back down- a fête he could never have managed, had Kanda not been so weakened\n\n\"Stay _still. _You're safe now, you're in the ark. I need to see to Alma so you shut up and sit there. Let me help him\"\n\nKanda nodded curtly, but swung himself into a sitting position so he could see what was going on. He shot Allen a challenging look, _daring _him to try and push him down again. Satisfied that his charge was not going to leap off the bed and further injure himself, Allen turned to assess Alma. There was no hope in his eyes however, and when he waved his wand over the emaciated form, it was really to confirmed his diagnosis rather than glean any information. A mist of faint blue sparks covered Alma from head to toe and above his body, faint lines traced his vital signs in the air. His heart beat traced its jagged line across the air slowly, almost feebly seeming to struggle to reach each peak and with every beat, it achieved lower and lower heights. Allen raised his eyes to Lavi and with a slight shake of his head, communicated the futility of their efforts. With a heavy heart, he turned back to Kanda. It was obvious that despite his attempts to remain stoic and separate, he was hoping for a different answer than the one Allen was about to give.\n\n\"I am really sorry Kanda\" He said softly, moving forward to face Kanda strait on. He didn't offer a hand of comfort, but instead gave the only consolation he could\n\n\"I can't save him but I can give you a chance to say goodbye properly. I need you to think about this carefully because if I go through with it, it will be hard on the both of you. I can, if you wish, block the circulation to the lower half of his body which will allow his heart to fill properly and circulate the necessary volume of blood to his brain. He will regain consciousness. It won't save him, but it will give you some time. He won't be in any pain, I promise you that\"\n\nKanda focussed his eyes determinedly on a spot directly behind Allen, a muscle in his jaw jumping periodically. He cleared his throat a couple times\n\n\"H-how long?\" He asked, still glaring fiercely at the wall, clearly furious that his emotions were showing\n\nAllen turned and consulted the blue lines still hovering above Alma's body, constantly erasing and rewriting themselves\n\n\"I would estimate ten minutes, although with his regenerative capabilities, it may be longer\"\n\nKanda pressed a hand against his mouth, as if trying to physically hold back his voice\n\nHe nodded curtly\n\n\"That would be... yes I...\"\n\nHe nodded again, clenching his jaw tighter\n\nAllen instinctively gripped his shoulder, squeezing tightly, then letting go just as suddenly, lest his gesture be taken for sympathy.\n\nHe turned back to Alma, saying to Lavi as he took out his wand\n\n\"Give Kanda some of the blood-replenishing potion, please. And a little essence of dittany in the worse wounds. They're on the second shelf over there- labelled- yep that's them.\n\nAnd no complaining Kanda\" He said, anticipating the protests that had just begun to form on Kanada's lips\n\n\"I will not have you going into shock\"\n\nHe touched his wand to the side of Alma's neck, and allowed little sparks of magic to follow the artery around the body, shutting off the links to all the organs aside from his heart, lung and brain. On second thoughts, he retained muscle control of his arms, reasoning that the few minutes of his life that this excess circulation would cost would outweigh the fear he would potentially feel at being unable to move any of his limbs. No sooner had the spell been cast, than the ghostly white face began to pink slightly. Allen linked his mind with the piano room again and the door they had entered through begun to glow slightly before cooling again to its plain grey colour. He raised his wand once more, raising up the body of Alma and moving toward the door\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Kanda snapped, though some of the aggression usually present in his voice was gone\n\n\"These are going to be the last few moments he spends on this earth. I think he would prefer to spend them somewhere other than this room\" Allen replied, smiled slightly. Kanda stood, brushing aside Lavi's hand and pulling his tattered robes over his newly sealed wounds. Allen opened the door and the natural light seemed so soft compared to the harsh white of the ark. They exited onto the green slope of a hill, which eased down into a lake, sporadic bursts of flowers breaking up the waves of knee high grass. The three walked up to the peak where Allen lowered the gently stirring body of Alma onto the ground, his back resting against the trunk of an almond tree, whose pale pink blossoms were just beginning to spiral downwards, creating a patchy blanket on the ground. Allen gently tucked the wgite blanket around his legs and retreated backwards, his footfalls muffled in the thick undergrowth\n\n\"Promise\" Lavi said as they walked together back to the ark\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry, I was sort of thinking out loud\" Lavi apologised, smiling slightly \"The almond tree. In Hebrew tradition. It's a bloom that represents promises kept. Or something like that. Just... I don't know. Seems fitting. Why did you pick here?\" They stepped together back into the ark, giving Kanda his privacy\n\n\"Kanda and I... we came here on a mission once and we walked past this point. It was the only step in the journey where he actually stopped. He didn't actually say anything but he stopped to look so I figured he would like it. Besides, they both grew up in the Order, I don't really think there was anywhere I could have taken them that would have held any particular meaning or nostalgia for them\" He shrugged one shoulder then suddenly grabbed the corner of one of the tables, blinking rapidly\n\n\"Hey, dude, you alright?\" Lavi asked, concerned, reaching for Allen's shoulder to steady him\n\nAllen shook his head, like a dog trying to get water out of his ears, pressing his eyes tight together then opening them wide\n\n\"Yeah I think so, I just don't normally try and control the ark without using the piano room and.. I..\"\n\nHis knees gave out suddenly and he pitched forward. Lavi darted toward him, seized him under the armpits, and slowly sat down, resting his head on his knees\n\n\"Woah\" Allen muttered rubbing a hand over his eyes\n\n\"Headrush\"\n\n\"Seriously dude, are you ok?\" Lavi repeated, putting a finger to Allen's wrist, checking his pulse and placing his other hand on his forehead worriedly\n\n\"I think so\" Allen started but was interrupted by his own stomach growling impressively\n\nAllen began to snigger which only worsened his light-headedness. He groaned and pressed his hands to his head again\n\n\"OK, so when was the last time you had something to eat\" Lavi scolded, motheringly a small smirk tugging at the edge of his mouth\n\n\"Mmmdunno, couple hours ago? Maybe longer?\" Allen mumbled, trying to sit up and immediately lying back down again, his head in Lavi's lap\n\n\"Woah\" He gasped \"I can't see anything now\"\n\n\"Alriiiighty then\" Lavi said, gently lifting Allen's head up and shuffling out from underneath him\n\n\"Imma getchoo some food. I think I saw a little village down at the bottom of that hill, and I am pretty sure I have some euros left over from previous missions. If all else fails, I'll just pull out the puppy eyes. You so much as think about sitting up before I get back and I will kick your tiny little behind from here to China, kay?\"\n\nAllen hummed non concomitantly, waving Lavi off. After a couple minutes though he got bored of staring at the ceiling and made his way on all fours out the door to the piano room. His head cleared slightly when he reached the pristine room, and he managed to keep his balance long enough to heave himself up onto the piano stool, though his ears did fill with an incessant buzzing sound at the sudden change in position. He pressed down on the keys, playing a single chord. The notes thrummed through the room and it connected through the ark. He linked the piano room up with outside, and it projected an image of the hilltop into the middle of the room, making sure that Kanda was still ok. He rested his head on the top of the piano and watched the projected image. He was kind of surprised that Alma had made it this long, they had been outside for almost fifteen minutes. He wasn't really sure how long he could perceivably hold on, his body was almost completely run down but... he sat up. Kanda had started forward and placed a hand the side of Alma's neck. Allen took a deep breath and forced himself to stand upright, trying to ignore the black spots dancing in front of his eyes.\n\nHe exited the ark into the cool evening, shivering slightly in the cold air. Kanda stood up and strode over to join him\n\n\"I think he's dead\" He muttered, running his fingers through his hair\n\n\"We were talking and he went quiet and closed his eyes and he isn't opening them\" There was an undercurrent of tension in his voice. Allen brushed his fingers against Kanda's arm as he passed\n\n\"I'll check on him\"\n\nHe made his way over the the tree, Kanda shadowing him a few steps behind. He knelt down beside Alma's body and checked his pulse.\n\n\"He's dead. I'm sorry\"\n\nHe sunk down on the grass beside Alma's body and gently pulled the white blanket over his face\n\n**Oo0ooOoo0ooO**\n\nThe steady sound of shovelling filled the air as Kanda and Allen dug a grave at the roots of the tree. The manual labour was almost comforting, and neither spoke to the other as the sunk further and further into the ground. Lavi reappeared after a while, laden with shopping bags. He wordlessly pulled Allen out of the hole, handed him a handful of chocolate bars then took his place, shooting him a deathly glare when he tried to join in again. The evening grew slowly darker and the temperature dropped even further. By the time the grave was finished, Allen had five different blankets wrapped around his shoulders and had devoured all the contents of the shopping bags. Lavi and Kanda heaved themselves out of the hole and sat staring at it rather blankly, as if unsure what to do now. Allen stood up and made his way over to join them. He could feel their eyes on the back of his neck as he approached Alma's body. He knelt down and placed one hand under his head, and the other under his knees, cradling the body ans he approached the grave. He paused momentarily as he tried to figure out how best to get the body in then, climbed down into hole. He carefully straitened the body out and on impulse, folded the white blanked back, to reveal the face again. He raised his wand and said 'orchus'. Silvery white flowers bloomed from the tip and he carpeted the bottom of the grave with them, finally conjuring a single lotus flower which he placed on the centre of Alma's chest. Lavi reached down, gripped Allen's forearm and heaved him out of the grave. Together, they filled the grave in, unanimously deciding that it was not something which Kanda should have to do\n\n\"What do you want on the headstone?\" Allen asked kindly as he waved his wand over the mound of earth, causing silver roots to sprout from the ground and weave themselves into knots and tangles over the body of the grave. They rejoined each other at the head of the grave, where they welded together and bloomed into a silver headstone decorated with rough engravements of almond blossoms\n\n\"Take your time to th-\" \"I don't care\" Kanda growled roughly staring off brutishly into the glowing horizon, where the sun was painting the land in hues of deep red, warm gold and pink as it died. Lavi exchanged uncertain looks with Allen, wondering how best to approach the highly strung man. It was completely obvious that he did care, and that this man's death had effected him on some level. Whether he had liked the boy or not was immaterial, he had been a close childhood companion and had suffered through horrendous treatment with Kanda. Whether or not they had shared a friendship did not really matter, they shared a history and deaths always strike close to home when there is a history- a simple and undeniable fact. Relationship really had little to do with it, and to be honest, Lavi had the impression that Kanda _had_ cared for the boy- or at least, had not hated him quite as much as he hated most people. Allen waited an appropriate amount of time to give Kanda the chance to change his mind but when he stubbornly remained silent he spoke again \"Alright, could you tell me a little about him then? What type of person was he?\" There was a long stretched out silence before Kanda spoke again, his voice still course but this time, Lavi could sense the emotion behind the anger. His voice was almost strangled, as if being forced out from behind a barrier, as if the emotions he was restraining were constricting his windpipe in revenge. \"He was irritating\" There was a long pause, which Allen chose not to break, simply watching Kanda patiently,his arms folded as he struggled to overcome his determined stoicism. \"Always cheery you know?\" He said eventually when the silence became unbearable even for him \"Like, we'd be battling or wounded or hungry or whatever and he would still be grinning like a little freak. Never shut up either\" he glared at the ground, his entire body tensed, as if he was literally battering against some invisible force. His jaw worked a bit and he tuned his head away from Allen and Lavi, becoming very interested in the landscape behind them \"Alright, may need you to help me out a little here\" Allen murmured to Lavi. They put together their heads and conferred for a moment Allen then walked over to the headstone and engraved words into the silver with his wand, speaking out loud as he did so, for Kanda's benefit \"Ok, how about this Here lies Alma Karma Aged 20 An exorcist and soldier of the black order We may never know how many lives he saved In his selfless service to humankind He was an unapologetically bright light in darkness and he shone even more brightly in the face of adversity lighting the lives of everyone around him It is the heartfelt prayer of all who knew him that in death, He finds the peace Denied him in life Kanda didn't so much as flicker in recognition of these words and Allen finally acknowledged the silent signals he was sending out and tugged on Lavi's sleeve, pulling him towards the ark, leaving Kanda standing alone on the dark hill with the silver grave shining behind him in the pale moonlight.\n\n**Oo0ooOoo0ooO**\n\nLavi lay curled up on the sofa in the piano room slipping in and out of a doze as Allen's slim fingers ran up and down the keys, picking out a meandering but peaceful tune, almost absent-mindedly. Lavi yawned widely turned to watch the projection Allen had running of the hillside. Kanda had disappeared some time ago off down the side of the mountain and had yet to reappear. \"What are we going to do\" Lavi said out loud, almost accidentally voicing the thoughts that had been running around in his head Allen refocused from his daydreaming, his fingers still picking out the gentle dreamy tune as he turned to look at Lavi, knowing what he meant without even asking \"We will wait here for today, give Kanda some time to be here with Alma then tomorrow I am going to hook the ark up somewhere outside of Hogsmede. I need to link up with the Order of the Phoenix somehow and help them with their efforts. I'm sure my ark will be of great use to them and now that I am free of the black order, I should be able to offer assistance. Things have been getting pretty bad from the looks of the daily prophet and without Dumbledore to protect the school... I am just worried. Snape is the new headmaster there and there have been all these new regulations... Ideally I would find Harry and help him but we agreed last summer that it was best to cut ties- the ark isn't secure enough for him to use and keeping in contact would just increase the chances of the communications being intercepted. I really do wish I had been able to do something for him though\" He sighed and stopped playing, pulling his legs up onto the piano stool and resting his head against his knees. \"Alright\" Lavi enthused, getting excited at the thought of meeting some of Allen's wizarding friends and getting the opportunity to see the magical world \"I've been wanting to see this stuff for ages! Can we go see the school?\" \"I don't think so\" Allen said dully, looking sad \"Since Dumbledore is dead now... things have just changed. Its basically an outpost for the ministry of magic and that pretty much means that it is being run by Voldemort. Pretty sure he an his followers have something of a bone to pick with me, what with my questionable blood history and relationship with Dumbledore and H-\" He broke off suddenly and leapt from the stool \"What the-\" Lavi leapt to his feet too, twirling on the spot, and pulling out Hiban, scoping the room for any number of Akuma or Noah creeping up behind him, his combative instincts kicking in immediately \"Where?\" He yelled, seeing no immediate danger and the immediate rush of fear wearing off slightly, leaving irritation in its place \"I though the Earl was popping out of the piano or som- Allen?\" Allen had drawn his wand and was running past Lavi, ignoring his indignation \"Death Eaters. Stay here Lavi, don't you _dare _follow me. You can't use magic\" He yelled as Lavi ran behind him to the door of the Ark. Allen leapt through, onto the white marbled street where four menacing black figures were striding between the buildings. Lavi teetered momentarily on the threshold before retreating back a few steps, watching from the door and battling against his instincts to leap into the battle alongside Allen Bright bursts of light were flying from the wands of four hooded men and were being held at bay by one of Allen's invisible shields but it was beginning to fai. One spell smashed through and crashed into the ground mere centemeters from his foot. The white floor bubbbled horribly and dissolved into a sludgy mess. Allen leapt back and one of his spells managed to hit the figure to his left, who fell to the ground stiff as a board. Allen was forced to fall to the ground as the three remaining death eaters shot at his already weakened shield. He raised his wand and silver daggers burst from his wandtip, speeding through the air towards the figures. The men desperately deflected the flying weapons and as they were preoccupied, Allen stunned a second one. The Death Eater to the far right however had not been taken in by this trick and with a flick of his wand, he redirected the silver knives to shoot back at Allen's head. As he leapt to the side to avoid them, two stunners shot strait for his head. He raised his wand and yelled \"Protegro\" vainly, knowing he would not be able to hold back the force of the combined spells but then something black blocked the path of the spells and he heard them explode against the barrier. He twisted around to see Lavi brandishing Hiban. \"Hurry up!\" He yelled, swinging the hammer at a scary looking green spell. It ricocheted off the hammer and took out a huge chunk of one of the buildings Allen exchanged a flurry of spells with the remaining two Death Eaters but they seemed significantly more skilled than the other two had been, and Allen very quickly had to shift from the offence to defence. The floor bubbled and cracked beneath his feet as the death eater to the right transfigured section after section- marble knives and swords flinging themselves of their own volition at Allen and Lavi. Lavi thankfully was able to deflect most of these but the second Death Eater was shooting curse after curse at both the boys, slowly wearing them down, and pressing closer and closer in on them. A black orb burst from the second death eaters wand, seeming to eat the surrounding light as it shot to the two boys. Allen grabbed Lavi's shoulders and threw him to the ground- he had never seen that spell before and had no way to defend himself from it. As they hit the floor, they heard a yell of pain. There was a moment of confusion as they tried to determine the source, but then they saw. The second death eater was lying unconscious on the floor with a huge lump protruding from his forehead and the first was frozen in fear with Kanda's sword tickling her throat\n\n**Oo0ooOoo0ooO**\n\nAllen crouched predator-like in front of the female Death Eater who was staring into his eyes in a slack jawed trance. Lavi shifted uncomfortably in the background- this branch of magic was endlessly fascinating to him but it made his skin crawl. Memories of Road climbing through his memories and turning him against his friends burned painfully in his minds eye and it was all he could do to stop himself from running out of the arc into the fresh air and away from the terrible memories\n\n\"Right\" Allen said, rocking back on his haunches, clearly satisfied with whatever he had gleaned from the woman's mind\n\n\"The Order are clearly in worse shape than I originally thought- also, heads up to you two- you-know-who's name is taboo. As soon as you say it, these delightful people appear to take you to their lord and master so we should avoid that if possible\"\n\n\"Taboo?\" Lavi asked curiously\n\n\"So they can enchant a _word?\" _This world of magic was infinitely more complex than he had ever imagined it to be and despite their precarious situation, he found all this new information thrilling\n\n\"I guess so\" Allen mused, touching his wand to the woman's head. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she collapsed on the ground. He repeated this with the other three and ushered Kanda and Lavi back into the ark\n\n\"I have never heard of such magic before but V- You-know-who is a very skilled wizard. He knows how to do things most wizards could hardly dream at. And things no human would _dare _dream of\"\n\nLavi shivered slightly, to have such power- it was unbelievable. He had never felt quite so intimidated and fascinated all at once. At least with the Akuma he had a weapon to defend himself but in the face of this there was no defence.\n\nAllen seemed to be thinking along the same lines\n\n\"I want to go find Fred and George first. They will have gone into hiding but I think if I go to the burrow I may be able to track them down. I'm sure someone there will know how to get a hold of them. They have invented a stack of products with shield charms woven into the fabric. They wont protect you and Kanda against the more advanced spells but they will certainly make me feel much better about this situation\"\n\nA few moments later, they excited onto another grassy hilltop, though this one was significantly less attractive than the previous one. Rain had hammered the stalks into the ground so they had mingled with the mud and turned the slope into something of an ice rink. Even Kanda slipped as they made their way gingerly down the hill- Lavi and Allen clinging to each others arms. About half way down, Lavi's foot shot out from underneath him and he pulled hard on Allen's arm trying to right himself and overbalancing him in the process. The two of them skidded to the foot of the hill, forging a trench in the sodden mud.\n\n\"_Lavi!\" _Allen yelled as he tried to de-tangle himself from the aforementioneds limbs.\n\n\"What is it _with _you and this obsession of making me fall!\"\n\n\"Sooory!\" Lavi moaned as he painfully got to his feet to, clutching his bruised ribs gingerly. Allen stood and sighed longsufferingly, trying to ignore Kanda as he reached the bottom of the hill in a dignified manner, smirking ever so slightly at the mud-soaked boys.\n\n\"It's fine!\" He muttered, waving his wand. Their clothes began to steam gently, but remained as sodden as ever. Allen frowned, his brows knitting together. He manoeuvred his wand slightly differently and the mud began drying out into a claylike substance. He broke the spell rapidly before they were both encased in dried mud\n\n\"I can't remember the spell\" He exclaimed, running his fingers through his hair and streaking the silvery strands with brown mud.\n\nHe gave Lavi a rather apologetic look\n\n\"I guess we will just have to wait till we get to the burrow\"\n\nLavi wrapped his arms tight around his torso, trying not to look cold and failing miserably\n\n\"It's fine! We haven't got far to go... do we?\"\n\nAllen didn't say anything and the silence kind of answered his question.\n\n\"Sorry\" He muttered again, looking guiltily at Allen, who's uniform was now plastered to his slight frame, rivulets of muddy water streaming off the hem of his trousers. Allen smiled his forgiveness and offered an arm to Lavi. Together, they made their way up the next slope, heads bowed against the driving wind and freezing raindrops, Kanda striding easily beside them as they went.\n\n\"It shouldn't be too much further\" Allen said in a rather strained voice, five minutes later. He checked with Timcanpy again, who was fluttering next to his masters head. The tiny creature, who was leading them bobbed up and down a couple times, which he took as conformation\n\n\"Sorry I parked the arc so far away, I don't know what defences they will have up around their house and the ministry is probably keeping an eye on them so I didn't want to set off any alarms\"\n\nThey crested the gentle incline and Allen raised a heavy arm to point at the shambolic building in the distance\n\n\"That's it!\"\n\nThey sped up slightly, feet slipping around in the sodden ground, the thought of a warm fire and a hot meal galvanising them into movement. They had hardly gone further than a few meters however when Kanda snapped out his arm which slammed painfully into their chests causing them to come to an abrupt hault\n\nLavi had just opened his mouth to yell at him when he clapped a hand over his mouth. The seriousness of his expression made Allen stop short of yelling too and instead, he pulled Lavi down\n\n\"What is it\" he hissed, eyes darting around, looking for danger. Kanda said nothing but raised a single finger to point into the rain, just to the side of The Burrow.\n\nAllen screwed up his eyes, struggling to see anything in the dim light.\n\n\"I don't-\" He started but then Lavi saw what Kanda had seen.\n\nHe grabbed Allen's arm\n\n\"There is someone there- look!\"\n\nThe rain was streaming down now in a proper torrent however, the flow was broken in the area where Kanda's finger was pointing. How he had spotted it, Lavi could not understand but there was someone standing there, hidden from sight, and their body was breaking the flow of rain. It was impossible to tell if they had been spotted or not but Allen assumed from the lack of curses flying over their heads that they were probably safe. To be sure though, he withdrew his wand again and tapped Lavi and Kanda on their heads and finally himself, casting a disillusionment charm on all three of them. Slowly, they backed off, keeping their eyes on the invisible man. Lavi tapped Allen's arm and gestured to a second, and third disturbance in the rain. Then realised that he was effectively invisible and therefore Allen couldn't see what he was doing\n\n\"Two more\" He whispered, leaning in close to the left and beside that tree.\n\nVery carefully, they ascended the hill they had just come over and once at the other side of it, they sped back to the arc\n\n\"Okay, that was a terrible idea\" Allen gasped as they burst into the arc again. Kanda threw a disparaging look at him and stalked off to one of the houses that Allen had managed (somehow, through tinkering on the piano) to link into a water system. Moments later, they heard the sounds of the shower starting. Lavi looked forlornly at the now steaming room. He could no longer feel his extremities and icy cold mud was trickling down the back of his jumper\n\n\"How are we going to get in contact with anyone from the order if they are all being watched?\" He sighed, lowering himself to the ground with a groan and hugging his knees, trying to retain as much body heat as possible. Allen frowned thoughtfully then seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\"I think I know where to go\" He said\n\n**Oo0ooOoo0ooO**\n\nLavi shifted uncomfortably under the robes Allen had given him. Not only were they too small for him, they also were just awkward to move around in. The skirt flapped around his legs, catching him as he walked and the trailing sleeves were just a nuisance. Why wizards didn't just wear normal clothes, he could not understand. Kanda was not wearing robes, but rather had done his uniform right up so that the collar covered the lower half of his face. Allen had assured them that where they were going, this would not be remarked upon, but that having two people in an unfamiliar uniform would perhaps raise a bit too much suspicion. As Lavi was the least likely of the two to behead him for forcing them into a dress, he had been given the spare set of robes. Allen himself had his hood up and pulled over his head so that his face was almost completely covered. Consequently, he was surreptitiously holding the sleeve of Lavi's robe so he wouldn't inadvertently walk into a building, though for all the attention Lavi was giving to steering them, this was a very real risk. He was however paying just enough attention to spot their destination, and despite the temptation to pretend not to have seen it so he could continue to gawp at the shops, he gently steered Allen towards the door, Kanda following silently in their wake\n\nThey entered into possibly the filthiest bar Lavi had ever come across. A handful of hooded, bandaged and robed customers shuffled over the dust covered floor or sat at grimy booths, gulping mysterious liquids from opaque glasses. The barman looked about as clean as his bar and the filthy apron tied sloppily round his waste only hinted at having once been white.\n\nAllen walked confidently to the bar and ordered three butterbeers, then on Lavi's excited request, changed it to two butterbeers and a firewhisky. The barman scowled irritably and swiped three glasses from under the counter. As he was filling up the flagons, Allen tilted back his head ever so slightly, so that the dim light caught his face, revealing for a split second, his scar. The barman's eyes sharpened slightly but other than that, there was no indication that he had seen anything. Allen took the drinks with a muttered thanks and they made their way to a booth in the corner of the bar, as far away from the other customers as possible. He handed out the drinks and nervously tugged his hood down even further\n\n\"What was that in aid of?\" Lavi asked in a low voice\n\n\"I don't think that barman was exactly friendly- in fact if he is rooting for anyone, I would bet it is the other side. What did you show him your scar for?\"\n\nAllen glanced around carefully before replying\n\n\"It's more of a hunch than anything really, Dumbledore came here sometimes- I remember him mentioning it every now and again. I don't think he and the bar man got on very well, but they _were _on speaking terms, and most people who were on speaking terms with Dumbledore have some sort of loyalty to him. Plus I don't think a man who runs a bar like this will be too keen on the ministry new regime of control and order. Even if he does side with them, I would be surprised if he reported us. I guess we will just have to wait and see.\"\n\nLavi raised his slightly steaming flagon to his mouth and took a gulp. Allen ended up pounding his back as he doubled over in a coughing fit\n\n\"That is poison\" He gasped out through a burning throat, taking huge gulps of Allen's butterbeer, the silky drink somewhat soothing the sensation\n\nAllen chuckled and swapped drinks\n\n\"Wimp\" He scoffed, taking a draught of it and downing it, flicking up his eyebrows triumphantly. The effect however was somewhat lost on Lavi as the hood was still concealing almost all of his face but Lavi could guess what he was doing\n\n\"How can you do that?\" He exclaimed incredulously, taking another draught of the butterbeer\n\n\"Years of practice\" Allen grinned, taking another swig\n\n\"I was a professional gambler remember? You can't gamble without drinking. Makes people suspicious\"\n\n\"But you were, like 10!\" Lavi protested weakly\n\nAllen shrugged one shoulder\n\n\"I was a carnie. We are a tough bunch\"\n\nThey passed the time chatting- well, Lavi and Allen past the time chatting- Kanda leaned back in the chair staring broodingly at his untouched drink. He seemed a long way away and Lavi and Allen decided to leave him to his thoughts, both for their own safety and out of consideration. He was, after all, still within the grieving period, whether or not he was willing to admit to it. The barman came over a few hours after they had finished their drinks to begrudgingly offer them a refill. When he returned, he handed a grubby reciept which, in the very corner had a single word scrawled\n\n_'wait'_\n\nTime ticked on, and one by one, the occupants drifted out. No friendly exchanges were given or offered by the bar man. It was the reason they all came. Anonymity and a lack of social niceties- a break from obligatory inquiries after ones health and the health of ones families. They came for the drinks and their deeds and that was all they wished to receive. The bell above the door swung silently as the last customer left- the ringer having fallen out a long time ago and had never been replaced. The barman walked over to the door and wrested with the lock for a moment before it screached unwillingly over, locking the four of them in.\n\nAllen stood up uneasily, one hand grasping his wand and pulled his hood back.\n\n\"I take it you know who I am\" He said, moving in front of Lavi and Kanda\n\n\"Aye\" The man replied roughly\n\n\"And a ruddy fool you are too- waltzing in here bold as brass. You are undesirable number 3. The price on your head is more money than any of you will see in your lifetime. Fools.\" He spat on the ground between them.\n\nKanda started forward, clearly irritated by the remark\n\n\"We did not ask for you to comment on our intelligence, merely to point us towards the Order. Either help us or let us go be fools elsewhere\" His tone was sharp and the barman, far from being incited by his aggressive tone, seemed to warm slightly\n\n\"Fair point, fair point. It is not for I to judge others for their foolish actions- however hopeless they may be. I am a bystander in this war you foolish youngsters are fighting. A Switzerland if you will. However, I believe I can help you somewhat with your ventures. I cannot put you in contact with the Order of the Phoenix- those naïve idiots have done surprisingly well at hiding themselves, however I can put you in touch with another imbecile who may be able to help you in that respect. He should be here any minute\"\n\nThe grubby man fell silent and stared at the wall behind the bar. There was a strained moment while they tried to figure out what he meant then Lavi noticed that the barman wasn't staring aimlessly into the distance but rather was watching the painting that hung there, and it was _moving._\n\nHe nudged Allen and pointed. A dark figure was growing ever bigger in the picture. Allen squinted at it but did not recognise the man until he clambered out\n\n\"Neville!\" He exclaimed joyfully and bounded over to his friend.\n\n\"It's good to see you again Allen\" Neville grinned clasping him in a tight hug\n\n\"Are you ready to join the battle?\"\n\n\n\t51. Chapter 51\n\nNeville showed Allen and Lavi to the room of requierment where he had explained, he and some students had fled to for refuge after the Carrow's had overtaken the school. Allen sat in serious silencce as Neville explained the many horrible ways in which Allen's only home had changed in the year and a bit since he had left it. It left him with a bitter taste in his mouth to imagine that this place of sanctity had too been poisoned. He thought of Dumbledore and how much he had sacrificed and strived to make this place a shelter from the outside evils. How he had held back the tide this long was beyond him. Some of the bitterness he had felt toward the old man's scheming ways dissapeared. He had not been so manipulative for fun, or to cause pain. He had simply been trying to prevent... well... _this. _And he had failed. The thought twisted like a knife in his gut and he realised then that he had made the right decision in coming back. He had to do all he could to fix this mess that he had made.\n\nAllen linked the ark up to the room of requierment, and slowly, with Neville's help, managed to contact each member of the Order of the Phoenix. The Weasly twins began broadcasting their radio shows from inside the Arc between their order duties, a well-stocked potions lab and healing room were developped out of popular demad by the many injured students and Order members. Allen was the main physician as he had spent so much of his time hanging around Madame Pomfry and healing his own wounds- he was nearly as apt as any healer. One of the very first things to be built whoever was an arc door in the attic of the Weasly's house so that they could evade their ministry shadows when required. When the door had first been opened, he rushed in, expecting to see Mai however with a grave face, Mrs Weasly told him that Hagrid had taken her, for fear that the ministry would do something, as her blood history was unknown. Where Hagrid was, no one knew.\n\nHe knew this was for the best however it still hit him rather hard and he couldn't help but wonder when he would ever see her face again. Still. Maybe she was better off without him\n\n_You shall lose the thing that is dear to you_\n\nMaybe it was for the best\n\nSoon there was a rather smooth system developed. Links were made at certain safe-points which allowed members of the order access to the arc and therefore gave them a centralised point from which to strategize. To help this, Allen created a tactical room with a huge pin board and a map covering seperate walls. A communications system was soon developed, using the galleons that Hermione had introduced for the DA. Allen tended to leave the fighting to the order, as he, Kanda and Lavi were continuing to fight back the tide of akuma- though the earl was no longer able to create akuma, he had managed to sum a great army and it felt almost pointless- as if they were plucking a few leaves off a forest of trees with the hope of felling them but something was better than nothing. It wasn't too long however before Lavi bored of this\n\n\"Look Allen, we need to strategise more. It is all well and good destroying Akuma and I'm not saying we should stop- all I am saying is we need to gather more intel about the Earl and about how he made the Akuma. We need more knowledge if we are going to tackle this properly. And most importantly of all, we need to know why Tyki didn't die when you stabbed him. It just doesn't make sense\"\n\n\"But how are we going to find anything? We can't get into the order, remember?\"\n\nLavi grinned knowingly\n\n\"The Order don't keep the records from back then. They have never been intersted in the How and the Why, more with the Who. The bookmen however know exactly where to go to find more information about technicalities\"\n\nThe two boys made their way down and down the spiralling staircase, descending deeper into the archives of the library. Allen raised the lantern higher, the flickering light dancing on the steps. After what seemed like an age, they reached the bottom, and came upon a heavy set wooden door. The rusty iron hinges screeched in protest as they forced it open between the two of them. Allen hung the lantern on an iron hook suspended from the ceiling and lit two candles from the flame, handing one to Lavi and keeping one for himself\n\n\"You take the left, I'll take the right\" He whispered, the words feeling wrong in silence. The atmosphere was almost unworldly, and Allen was filled with an almost reverent feeling. The stone walls stretched up high above their heads and the thick dust that carpeted the floors muffled even their footsteps. The effect was somewhat unsettling and both boys were grateful to see the other when they reconvened at the central table with piles of documents and books for review. Hours and hours passed with nothing but the ruffling of parchment and the occasional muffled sneeze as clouds of dust were stirred by eddies of air\n\n\"I've found one!\" Allen rasped eventually, his throat feeling like sandpaper\n\nHe heaved a leather bound sheaf of paper round to face Lavi and pointed to the faded, almost brown ink on the page\n\n\"It mentions a dark and unknown substance being discovered here. Something about workers uncovering it through illegal mining of a 'holy mountain'\"\n\nLavi leant forward, abandoning the book he was perusing to peer at the page\n\n\"Yeah, I think you might be right, those dates would somewhat fit with our records- only about 10 years out from the first sighting of the Noah... Hang on.\"\n\nHe walked round the table and perched on the edge of Allen's seat and the two read the manuscript together\n\n\"There\" Lavi breathed excitedly, pressing his finger against the page\n\n\"blah blah witchcraft blah blah angered gods... there, the sorcerer Sennen Hakushaku curséd be his name delved into the abyss and removed the demon stone from hence... Sennen Hakushaku, that must have been the Earls original name. I knew his alternate name is Adam but... wait a sec\"\n\nHe leant over the table and pulled a few parchments over\n\n\"He is mentioned a few times in these manuscripts too, see here, and here\" He lifting a few sheaf's of paper from the stacks piled at his end of the table. He pointing to the name on each sheet\n\n\"Always within the context of sorcery, or witchcraft. Here it is recorded that he healed a member of the royal family from a mysterious illness- he was knighted for his trouble and I assume that is why the authorities turned a blind eye to the other, less pleasant incidences\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Allen asked, who was quietly impressed by Lavi's memory. Obviously it had been part of his training as a bookman but he had read thousands of pages and yet was locating that one name with absolute ease\n\n\"Well, I didn't notice it at first however there were many reports of disappearances in this region- on the surface, they did not seem suspicious but if I remember rightly- and I probably do- when the name Sennen Hakushaku appeared on the village census, it was mirrored by an increase in disappearances. Plus this paper here mentions an incident of a curse being placed on a household by a sorcerer. They all died in a fire shortly after\"\n\n\"So\" Allen said slowly, piecing it all together \"The Earl came across the Dark matter first. Obviously he had some powers already, perhaps he was a wizard. Is there any mention of the other Noah?\"\n\nLavi shrugged\n\n\"Not that I came across\"\n\nWith increased zeal, they delved into the files again, returning the useless books to the shelves and pulling out every record they could find surrounding that date. Their energy began to flag however as time passed and the candles began to gutter as they too ran out of fuel to keep going. Allen's head slumped down to rest on the pages of a thick tombe and though he knew he should move, it was not until his candle dripped a globule of hot wax on his hand that he jerked awake\n\n\"We should go\" He mumbled sleepily, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth and his head spinning slightly with fatigue. Lavi hummed in sleepy agreement and they trudged their way back up the stairs at a significantly slower pace than their initial downward journey. Allen waved his wand over the dumbfounded guards as they passed before the blossoming protests could even leave their lips. Their eyes became vacant once again as he erased the memory of them being there and they left them smiling stupidly into the distance as they disappeared through the ark door which dissipated as soon as they stepped over the threshold.\n\nThey blinked in confusion as they exited into the room of requirement, where the sunlight was streaming through the windows. Kanda raised his head from the documents he was studying when they entered\n\n\"Anything happen while we were gone?\" Allen asked with some trepidation, but to his relief, Kanda shook his head but jerked his head toward the board where there were a few new messages from the Order. Allen dragged himself over to read them but thankfully they were just updates about sightings and troop movements. He sunk down in one of the sofas and Lavi joined him heaving a deep sigh of relief and closing his eyes. The two sunk into a half doze but then Lavi jerked into a sitting position all of a sudden\n\n\"Wait! If he was a wizard, do you think there would be anything about it in the Library here?\"\n\nAllen cracked his eyes open, blinking sleepily\n\n\"mmm... maybe\" He sat up too, excitement sparking in his eyes \"That is actually a great... oh hang on, no\" He slumped back down in disappointment\n\n\"That was before the Ministry of Magic was implemented, there were no records of magic- borns back then. No schools or anything, people were just magic or they weren't. He probably didn't even know he was a wizard. Probably just thought he was a superior being or something. It would certainly fit with his whole 'wipe out the humans thing'. Still, I guess we could have a look tomorrow\"\n\nLavi hummed in disappointment and burrowed further down into the sofa cushions closing his eyes again\n\nNeville threw the door to the room of requirement open, and threw his bag into the corner in disgust. He had been held back for an _hour _after class to be subjected to a lecture on wizards innate superiority to muggles and had been ordered to hand in a three foot essay detailing the many failings of muggle-kind and the harm they had caused to wizards through the ages. He started towards the fire but his way was blocked by a gaggle of students surrounding George, who was scribbling something down on a scrap of parchment, accepting coins from the students and stowing them in a battered dragonskin pouch. Neville approached the group, and they quickly dispersed at his appearance, looking somewhat sheepish. George grinned cheerily as he approached, tucking the parchment away nonchalantly.\n\n\"What are you up to?\" Neville asked suspiciously\n\n\"Oh nothing much\" George replied,breezily \"Just a little light-hearted gambling. Business is a little slow at the moment, you understand, need to put some bread and butter on the table!\"\n\nNeville gave George a withering look, glancing pointedly at the dragons skin pouch and lush, fur lined robes which,while worn were far finer than anything he owned. George shrugged, unembarrassed\n\n\"What can I say, I have refined tastes\"\n\n\"What are you betting on?\" Neville asked pointedly, fixing George with a glare\n\n\"Alright, alright. You were so much more fun before you had a backbone,you know that? I'm making bets on how long it'll be before one of those two admits his love for the other\" He jerked his head conspiratorially to the sofa behind him where Allen and Lavi were sleeping soundly,Lavi sprawled along the length of the sofa, his head in Allen's lap, and Allen's arm draped loosely over his shoulder. Nevile was slightly taken aback by this revelation, though even as he stuttered out his surprise,he began to think about it. They had hardly been apart since the two had arrived, and they did get on very well. Was there more to it than just friendship?\n\n\"Of course there is\" Came a soft, dreamy voice. Neville jumped. Luna always seemed to appear with no warning or noise. How she did it, he would never know. Perhaps the garden gnomes had given her the gift of stealth at Fleur's wedding...\n\n\"Could you put me down for one month?\" She asked George politely, handing over a couple of sickles and few knuts\n\n\"What, you think they fancy each other too?\" Neville asked,rather surprised that Alen's ex was betting on his next relationship. With a boy. Not that Luna was your average girl, but even for her, that was strange.\n\n\"Of course\" She replied, looking at Neville as if _he_ was the odd one for not thinking so too\n\n\"Allen doesn't let his guard down unless he is completely comfortable with a person. He would never fall asleep with someone unless he really trusted them and he certainly wouldn't chat so freely with them unless he cared for them. Haven't you noticed the change in him lately?\"\n\nNeville was taken aback but now that he thought about it, Allen had lost a lot of his formality, and he had seemed a lot more relaxed around everyone than he had been at school before all 'this' had happened. Mind you, _he_ had changed a lot since the war. It seemed to bring out the hidden nature of people. Whether good or bad. Neville turned back to look at the seeping duo and passed George a handful of coins\n\n\"Put me down for two months\" He said\n\nHe hoped that they would get together. They both deserved some happiness, however fleeting it may be\n\nAllen and Lavi sat at the head of the table, Kanda beside them, frowning but attentive. A few members from the order had also gathered and Lee was sitting in the corner of the room, keeping an eye on all the surveillance equipment.\n\n\"Alright\" Lavi said, sweeping his hair out of his eyes. He had lost his hairband somewhere in a library in Germany and unfortunately, one of the things that the arc and the room of requirement seemed unable to produce, was clothing. He and Allen both looked like they had been dragged through a hedge backwards as a matter of fact. An a very dusty hedge at that. They had spent the last few weeks scouring libraries all over the world, following the trail of the Earl and consequentially, they had forgotten about sleep and hygiene. Well. Lavi had anyway. Allen looked somewhat decent having acquired a travel iron from somewhere but even his clothes were looking somewhat dishevelled and his hair was slightly greyer than usual due to the accumulation of dust\n\n\"We think we have figured out some stuff about the Earl\"\n\n\"Spit it out\" Growled Kanda\n\n\"We haven't got all day\"\n\nLavi opened his mouth to make some witty reply but Allen interrupted him before he could enter an argument, shooting him a dirty look\n\n\"We managed to find the record of when the Earl first discovered the dark matter. We think he was probably a wizard- though he did not know it at the time. He is referred to as a sorcerer at times and seemed to be able to curse people and so on. Magic was rather primitive in those days as there was no overarching governing body and few magical communities. This may be why he was able to accommodate the dark matter\"\n\n\"Yeah\" Lavi chimed in, pulling down a map and pointing to the small village in which the dark matter had first been discovered\n\n\"After finding it, he moved here\" He pointed to a mountainous range in Austria\n\n\"Probably to study the innocence. He disappeared for a while at this point then returned to the area he had originated from. People shortly after this started disappearing from the villages. Mainly the poor and unimportant\"\n\nAllen shot him a look at this but didn't say anything\n\n\"We are pretty sure he was experimenting on them. After a number of fruitless attempts, he disappeared again. The authorities found tortured and grotesque bodies in his mansion however, the body of a young girl that recently had gone missing did not reappear. We think that he got her pregnant then did something to the child to bind its soul to the dark matter\"\n\nAllen pulled a sheet of paper out of one of the bundles\n\n\"We traced him as best as we could- he took up a pseudonym- but when he reappeared, he had a little girl. We think this was Road. After this, it is a little bit of guesswork again, but he must have realised that 'special' or 'magical' people were the only ones capable of binding their souls to dark matter. People stopped disappearing and he became a gynaecologist- or the equivalent in those days. He injected promising woman's fetuses with dark matter we think. Some under his care had terrible miscarriages with deformed children and others had their children kidnapped later in their life. Presumably when they showed that they had abilities. This is, we think, how the Noah originated\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" Kanda interrupted beginning to look rather irritated\n\n\"You must understand the past to understand the future\" Lav said pretentiously, holding up a finger and looking self righteous. Allen rolled his eyes\n\n\"We needed to know why Tyki got stronger after I tried to kill him, and how the Noah were able to transfer into different bodies, or how would we know if we had really killed them?\"\n\nKanda pressed his lips together, then indicated his head slightly, acknowledging their point\n\n\"So. Skipping ahead slightly, we have the Noah family. Neah plots against the Earl for whatever reason and kills the majority of them, however he does not succeed in killing the Earl- or Road for that matter- and this is why they survived we believe. The Earl held the original piece of dark matter and therefore we believe he is the source or hub of its power. This is why the Noah's souls were not destroyed when their bodies were destroyed and perhaps explains why they are so obedient to him, and turned against human kind.\"\n\n\"But that still doesn't explain why you couldn't kill Tyki.\" Kanda pointed out, impatience palpable in his voice\n\n\"Yes, well, we pieced together some knowledge from scraps of the Earls abandoned research. The Akuma are made by linking a human soul with a scrap of dark matter to an artificial skeleton whereas the Noah- as we previously mentioned- are human souls _mixed _with dark matter. When these sould were put into host bodies, they overcame the host bodies soul and maintained control over the body however inTyki's case, the human soul battled with Tyki's for domincance hence his slightly dulled power. When I stabbed Tyki, I severed the attachment of the host soul, rather than the Noah soul, as the Noah soul is stronger than the human one and cannot be destroyed until the Earl is\"\n\n\"But _I _killed Skin Bolic\" Kanda challenged\n\n\"You killed his _body. _I mean, he is effectively out of the game because it would take too long for the Earl to find a suitable host and wait for his soul to overcome the host soul and complete his reincarnation, but he technically will not die until the Earl does. None of them will\"\n\n\"So in short, the only way to win this battle is to kill the Earl\" Kanda summed up\n\n\"Pretty much\" Allen said \"And now we know why Neah's soul is inside me- his body was destroyed and someone bound his soul to mine. We don't know who yet\"\n\nThere was an uncomfortable pause as everyone in the room avoided Allen's gaze\n\n\"Em, did you find any way to... reverse the process?\" Neville asked eventually but both the boys shook their heads\n\n\"We dug up all of the research we could find but it seems the only way to destroy Neah's soul is to destroy the Earls. In fact, that doesn't even necessarily ensure he'll go away. It just ensure that Neah's soul will not live beyond my death. So once the Earl is dead, the Noah can be killed and will stay dead, but as for removing their souls from their host bodies... well...\" He shrugged\n\n\"We just aren't sure\"\n\nAllen smiled reassuringly at their uncomfortable faces\n\n\"Look guys, don't worry about it. As long as I am in control, everything is fine and as soon as I lose it, my good friend here\" He gestured to Kanda who glared moodily back \"Has promised to release me from my fleshy prison\"\n\nEveryone in the room gaped at Kanda but before anyone could express their outrage, Lee interuppted them\n\n\"Guys! Call through from the Order. The Ministry have discovered one of our safe houses. The cottage in Forris. They are sending Death Eaters out now! We need to do something\"\n\nThere was a panicked flurry as everyone leapt up from the table. Lee siezed his gold galleon and sent out a distress signal but Neville stood on the table and yelled\n\n\"Everyone stop!\"\n\nSilence fell and everyone turned to him\n\n\"Split into teams. Kanda will come with me, Allen take Lee, Seamus, pair with Lavi. Allen- you know where the cottage is right?\"\n\nAllen nodded in affermation but opened his mouth to speak\n\n\"I know what you are going to say, but they have to come with us\" Neville cut across, predicting his protest before it left his lips \"They don't have magic but they have already proven themselves cpable of fighting wizards and we don't have enough time to wait for reinforcments. Allen open doors approaching the cottage from the North-East, South and South West. Close them immediately afterwards. We will approch the cottage from these directions to scout for death eaters. Whoever reaches the cottage first, take down the protective charms and send up a flare. Allen will then be able to open a door inside the field and whoever is there can take them through and get them to safety. Keep your coins with you so we can communicate\"\n\nEveryone nodded and Allen ran to the piano room with Lee hot on his heels. His heart hammered in his chest at the thought of the fight but as soon as his fingers found the cool ivory, its frantic rhythem calmed and his fingers flowed over the keys with ease. Two doors bloomed in the tactical room and the third blossomed into existance next to the piano room. Lee and Allen exited this door as one\n\nNeville and Seamus heaved Lavi up onto the table in the middle of Allen's lab, shoving all the papers and bottles off unceremoniously to clear a space. The papers whirled and floated to the the floor and the clattering of glasses as they rolled and smashed on the bare stone floor seemed appropriate for the panicked situation. Allen ran to Lavi's side, hot on Neville's heels and assessed the damage quickly, his mind whirring as he figured out a plan.\n\nLavi moaned and his hand twitched but fell still again.\n\nAllen waved his wand in a sweeping motion, causing a blue net to fall over Lavi and sink into his skin. The familiar numbers and figured popped up over his innate body, a trace marking his heart rate and numbers shimmering beside it indicating the dire state of his blood pressure and cardiac output\n\n\"ABC, ABC\" Allen muttered grabbing Lavi's head and gently tipping it back slightly, opening his mouth to check for obstruction. Once satisfied that there was none, he took a deep preparatory breath and muttered an incantation, performing an intricate twisting motion with his wand. A thin, shimmering ripple bloomed from his wand end, shaped like a tornado. He directed this wand towards Lavi's open mouth and the tip of the air stream entered the windpipe, stretching down and then forming a bubble over the boys mouth, providing him with oxygen. He turned to check the respiratory rate and tidal volumes. Once satisfied with the numbers, he seized a few vials from the shelf behind him, including the blood-replenishing potion, of which he drew up a generous portion into an old fashioned metal syringe. He mixed this with carefully measured doses of the other vials and once satisfied, he injected these into Lavi's left arm, which was relatively uninjured.\n\n\"I need bandaged, gauze and hot water\" he said out loud, his voice trembling slightly. He didn't address it to anyone in particular, in fact if he was honest, he wasn't even sure who was in the room with him, he was so preoccupied with saving Lavi. It was therefore with some shock that he noticed Kanda giving him the supplies he had requested. He must have sent Seamus and Neville out- Allen knew they would not have left voluntarily. For some reason, he found Kanda's silent and unruffled presence calming. He took the items from him\n\n\"Thanks\" he breathed and Kanda nodded curtly\n\n\"Take a breath\" He said gruffly\n\n\"His blood pressure is under control and he is breathing fine. His wounds aren't bleeding that badly and you need to calm down and get that seen to\"\n\nAllen looked at Kanda with some confusion. He reached up almost dreamily to touch his forehead and when he removed his hand, it was scarlet with blood.\n\n\"Oh\" he said, somewhat faintly\n\n\"Go through there, that blonde girl is patching up the others. I'll watch him\"\n\nAllen left the room somewhat reluctantly, leaving Kanda to watch over Lavi's innate form. Through in the main room, Luna was handing out mugs of boiling hot spiced pumpkin juice to the other shell-shocked members of his team who had already been healed of their minor injuries. They now sat huddled in woollen blankets around the fire, apart from Neville who was speaking in hushed tones to a small group of students in the corner- supposedly the relatives of the families they had rescued. One of the boys burst into tears and the girl beside him embrace him tightly, smiling through her tears and thanking Neville profusely. He smiled wearily and squeezed her shoulder. He shooed the curious onlookers away with a look and on seeing Allen, ushered him to one of the armchairs near the fire. Luna quickly joined them and dabbed Allen's head wound with a globule of bright orange paste. The wound stung for a moment then numbed over and she cleaned off the excess blood with a handful of gauze\n\n\"How is he?\" Neville asked \"What happened?\"\n\nAllen shook his head \"I don't know, I missed it. I was getting the muggle-borns out of the cottage when they sent up the distress signal\"\n\n\"He dodged a curse and it hit the tree behind him and it exploded\" Seamus said, his face pale\n\n\"I should have cast a shield\" He groaned burying his face in his hands \"I'm so sorry Allen\"\n\nAllen smiled gently \"It wasn't your fault Seamus, you know that. Lavi will be fine- speaking of Lavi...\" He made to get to his feet but Luna gently pressed him back down\n\n\"Not yet\" She said softly, handing him a box of Honeyduke's fudge and a flagon of hot pumpkin juice\n\n\"You need some fuel. I know you don't like the chocolate so I bought you some fudge. I would have made you my own special batch but sugar bean paste is so hard to locate. Daddy's crop is usually quite productive but I didn't bring any with me\" She continued along this line, chatting about the many benefits of sugar paste and how it attracted kelpies, distracting Allen with her chatter. As he listened to her, the fondness he had felt when he first met her filled him, replacing the fear and adrenaline running through his veins. He finished the box and stood. Neville started as if to join him but Allen held out a hand\n\n\"No, you are exhausted- there's no point in us all staying up. You lot have classes tomorrow but I don't. Besides, as good as you are with Herbology, you are kind of rubbish with healing\" He smiled taking the sting out of the insult\n\nNeville grinned sheepishly \"You're not wrong, but I want to stay with you two. Make sure everything is okay. Promise I won't touch anything\"\n\nSeamus nodded and got to his feet\n\n\"Yeah, me too. If its alright with you\"\n\nAllen nodded and the three of them made their way through to the potions room again. Kanda rose from his seat beside Lavi and moved aside to let Allen in. Allen sat down on the seat and smiled as Lavi's eyes opened\n\n\"Hey there bud\" He grinned \"You feeling alright?\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Lavi murmered\n\n\"Nothing too bad\" Allen said casually, conjouring up a bowl of water and cutting through the material of Lavi's trousers, soaking the dried blood off with a bowl of hot water \"You were in a minor explosion, and you're are currently wearing half a tree but we'll get that out of you now alright? I need you to stay talking if you can? Just to make sure you don't... to make sure you don't have a concussion or anything\" he glanced over his shoulder to Neville and Seamus who were sitting obediently in the corner\n\n\"Could you come over here and just chat to him? Here, let me get you something for the pain\" He tipped a vial of a blue potion into Lavi's mouth as Neville and Seamus moved next to Lavi's head and began chatting animatedly to him. Seamus begun acting out the whole incident using Neville as the death eater while Allen pulled the shrapnel methodically out of Lavi's leg, one splinter at a time. Taking it out, disinfecting the wound and sealing up the flesh. Hours ticked by and the conversation went from 'what superpowers would you have' to 'its euthanasia morally justified' to general chat about school, friends and life. It was rather amusing to listen to Lavi, as the combination of shock, blood loss and painkillers had clearly removed some of his inhibitions and he was acting somewhat drunk\n\n\"So you can, like, read people?\" Seamus asked curiously \"Like a psycic?\"\n\n\"A what?\" Neville asked, confused\n\n\"Yes\" Lavi replied grinning \"I'm super good at reading people. Watch. _You_\" He pointed drunkenly at Seamus \"Forgot to do your herbology homework and you are waiting till Neville goes to bed so you can steal his and copy it\"\n\nSeamus flushed and grinned sheepishly at Neville\n\n\"How did you know?\" He asked\n\n\"You are fiddling with the cuff of your sleeve, which is something you do when you are nervous, you are being nicer than usual to Neville, because you are feeling guilty, plus you keep checking your watch and glancing at Neville's bag in the corner\"\n\nThe two boys were amazed by this and spurred him on to more readings\n\n\"So can you, like predict how people are going to act in certain situations?\" Seamus asked curiously as Allen moved up to Lavi's shoulders, removing a large chunk of bark and placing a soothing tincture on the worst burns\n\n\"Yeah, though it is easier with someone I know- so like Allen, he is fairly easy to predict when we are fighting. He is very reckless and will throw himself into dangerous situations if someone is in danger, no matter how many people he is up against. He risks his own life because he doesn't think it is worth anything. Probably because he didn't have any parents growing up an felt abandoned and unworthy of love. That effect was worsened after Mana because Mana made him feel worthy of love and treated him like a son then died suddenly, effectively abandoning him and when Allen brought him back he cursed him, so Allen felt responsible for the pain he caused his adoptive father and after that thought Mana hated him. Plus now he is worried that Mana never loved him to begin with because now he knows that Neah- the Noah inside him- was in fact Mana's brother so Mana might have adopted him because of that, rather than because he actually cared about him. So Allen is almost suicidal in battle, as he truly believes that everyone else is more important than he is\"\n\nThe silence that followed this statement was the most painful one that any of them had ever experienced. Lavi was completely unaware of the damage he had caused but Neville and Seamus were staring in horror at Allen who had turned white as a sheet\n\n\"Allen\" Neville said weakly but Allen sat stony faced, not a flicker of emotion crossing his face\n\n\"I'm fine\" He said, smiling at the two horror-struck boys\n\n\"It's just the shock and the painkillers I gave him, he has kind of lost his inhibitions. Don't worry about it. I am almost finished here anyway\"\n\nHe continued to remove the last of the splinters from the side of Lavi's head, acting as if nothing at all was wrong, his face completely passive. Lavi thankfully had shut up at this point and seemed to be dozing. By the time Allen had finished bandaging up his head in fact,he was fast asleep. Neville looked helplessly as Seamus who looked near to tears, his expression distraught.\n\n\"That's all I can do for now. The wounds and burns should heal by themselves in the next few days though he will require overnight monitoring\" Allen said finally, raising his wand and lifting Lavi's body gently off the table and placing it down on a rolled out futon that Kanda had brought down from the boys dorm. The dark haired boy was sitting on a stool nearby, watching the proceedings with an unreadable expression. He inclined his head ever so slightly at the unasked request, indicating that he would watch over him\n\n\"I'm going up to bed now, I suggest you two do the same. I am very grateful for all of your help, but it is late, and you have classes tomorrow. Goodnight\" He bowed to the other two ever so slightly and turned, heading up to the dormitory\n\n\"Allen, wait\" Neville cried weakly. Allen paused, one foot on the stairs.. He tuned and smiled politely\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Are- Are you sure you are alright? It's just... With what Lavi said...\"\n\nAllen smiled again, almost indulgently \"Of course I am fine. Like I said, the medication obviously lowered his inhibitions somewhat. Besides, what he said was probably rather accurate\" He shrugged one shoulder dismissively and turned again, disappearing off to his bed\n\nLavi did not waken until late the next evening, by which time, Kanda had abandoned his post to be replaced by Luna. The pale girl smiled faintly as he blearily opened his eyes and licked his dry lips, attempting to speak\n\n\"Here\" She said, holding out a beaker of faintly blue liquid. Lavi eyed it somewhat warily, having been informed in great detail about the girls odd tastes and beliefs however,his thirst quickly won out and he gulped down two mouthfuls of the liquid which was pleasantly fresh\n\n\"I brewed it with some elderflower and angel-hair cordial. My mothers own invention. She gave it to me when I was unwell. It encourages the body to heal and wards off poisons\"\n\nLavi slowly drained the remainder of the drink as Luna watched, her gaze steady, and faintly curious. As if waiting for him to say or do something\n\n\"Is.. is everything alright?\" Lavi asked, with some trepidation\n\n\"Well\" Luna replied thoughtfully \"Not really, there are a whole lot of things that are not alright. But then again things are never _all_ alright. Something is always wrong somewhere. Though, currently, more things seem to be not alright than normal. So I think the answer to that question must be no. Everything is not alright\"\n\nIt took Lavi's sleep and potion addled brain a few minutes to figure out what she had said, then a few more to discern if she was simply winding him up, but it did not seem so. Her face was serious, her little mouth pursed slightly as if he had posed a rather interesting riddle and she was waiting to see if she had gotten the answer right. He shook his head and decided not to pursue the matter any further\n\nShe shrugged and finished checking his dressings, then wondered off dreamily. Lavi struggled to his feet wincing as his body complained. His skin felt almost taught and he gathered that he had been burned rather badly by the explosion. He was rather surprised that Allen wasn't beside him really, he usually had to literally drag him away from his patients, and the little idiot would often go days on end without proper sleep in order to ensure that his patients got exactly the care that he wanted. It was very frustrating usually however now Lavi kind of wished that he was there. He slowly made his way to the arc, but Allen wasn't in the tactical room, piano room or Mrs Weasly's. He returned to the common room which was gotten slightly more busy. Most of the students seemed to be in their house dorms, but as usual there were a few hiding out from the inquisitorial squad. There was however, no familiar white head so, worn out from searching, Lavi gave up. The next morning however was the same. No Allen anywhere and Lavi was beginning to get rather concerned. He practically accosted Neville when he came into the common room and demanded to know where Allen was. Neville shuffled his feet rather uncomfortably, then grabbed Lavi's elbow, steering him to a quiet corner of the room\n\n\"Look, do you remember anything about what happened when Allen was healing your wounds?\"\n\nLavi regarded Neville blankly. What had that to do with anything? He thought back hard, but his memories were out of focus and he could only remember little snippets of conversations. He shook his head helplessly\n\n\"Not really. What does that have to do with anything?\"\n\nNeville ran his fingers through his hair and puffed out his cheeks\n\n\"Okay... um... you kind of said some things...\" He filled Lavi in on what had been said and Lavi's face slowly drained of colour. He couldn't _believe _it. Those recordings had not been meant for general consumption, they had just been his own speculations and thoughts. They had certainly not been meant for Allen to hear.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Lavi said, desperation tingeing his voice \"Please, I need to talk to him\"\n\nNeville hesitated momentarily, then nodded his head to an ornate oak door in the corner of the room that had not been there the day before. It just showed how much Lavi's injuries had effected him that he had not noticed it before\n\n\"In there. He's replenishing the potions stock or something. He's been in there since... since you said that stuff\"\n\nLavi strode over to the door, feeling Neville's eyes between his shoulders. He didn't even know hat he was going to say. How could he have been so stupid- bookmen never revealed their recordings to their subjects. He climbed the set of stone steps beyond the door and heard Allen's voice quietly muttering\n\n\"Stupid, stupid, stupid\" over and over again. Lavi poked his head around the archway, to see Allen standing over a bubbling cauldron of potion, looking rather upset. He waved his wand and the entire cauldron emptied instantly. He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair, then pulled a handful of ingredients out of a basket to start over. Lavi cleared his throat to get his attention, and Allen turned, flushing slightly when he saw him\n\n\"Sorry about that\" He laughed lightly\n\n\"I am afraid that is the second time I have messed that potion up. I really am not doing very well today! How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"I'm fine\" Lavi said, stepping into the room \"Look Allen, I-\"\n\nAllen cut him off, waving a hand dismissively\n\n\"I know you didn't mean for me to hear that stuff. Don't worry about it. I am fine. Besides, we both know that it was true\" He smiled and Lavi immediately realised how deeply his thoughtless words had cut his friend. Guilt stabbed at his heart and twisted painfully.\n\n\"Look man, will you talk to me for a bit? This can wait till later\" He gestured to the now-empty cauldron \"You are obviously exhausted\"\n\nAllen's smile dropped slightly and Lavi could clearly see the reluctance in his shadowed eyes, but he knew that he would agree, to maintain his mask of indifference. They sat down on a sofa that graciously appeared in the corner of the room. They sunk down onto the plush cushions and Allen turned his tiered gaze to Lavi's serious one\n\n\"Allen\" Lavi started uncertainly\n\n\"I just want you to know- that stuff I said- it's not all that I think of you. I mean, the stuff is kind of true but we all have our demons from the past and I don't want you thinking that when I look at you, I see a series of symptoms and psychologies. You are far more than all that, you are kind and generous and gentle. All that stuff that happened to you could have made you hard and cruel but it didn't. It made you kind, and I just want you to know, that you're not just some string of tragedies- you are a great dad, a loyal friend and a talented soldier. I look up to you dude. I really do\"\n\nAllen's face didn't change at all for the next couple minutes, then he gave a small, shy smile- a proper one this time, and a warm glow kindled in Lavi's stomach.\n\n\"Thank you\" he whispered, placing a hand on Lavi's arm. Neither moved for some time, then Allen spoke again\n\n\"I want to say something too Lavi. I _know_ that you are more than just an emotionless bookman. You are funny and kind too. You have helped us all so much, and we care for you deeply. I know that you aren't to get attached to the people you record, but we all care for you and consider you a friend. I thought... thought you should know that. That we care about you\"\n\nHis heavy lids drooped slightly as he spoke and he rested his head against Lavi's shoulder. His words added heat to the flames inside Lavi, and looking down at the white eyelashes resting gently on Allen's pale cheeks, he did something he knew he should not have. He gently placed a kiss on the his cheek. Almost immediately he realised what he had done and stammered\n\n\"I- I'm sorry-\" But Allen just sleepily cracked opened one eye and stretched up, placing a sweet, chaste kiss on Lavi's lips, then sinking off to sleep, his weight warm and heavy on Lavi's shoulder.\n\nRain pelted violently against the window and the wind was so forceful, it rattled the glass panes in their frames. Allen shivered and pulled his blanket tighter around his shoulders, staring out mesmerised at the rain drops chasing each other down the glass, wondering how this amazing room worked, and how it could be showing a real view of the Hogwarts grounds if it didn''t really exist. He glanced up when Lavi shuffled into the room, wiping sleep from his eyes\n\n\"Hey you\" He smiled, holding out the bottom end of his duvet\n\n\"Come join. Its warm in here\"\n\n\"I'll be there in a sec\" Lavi yawned and shuffled through into the arc, door still in a vaguely zombified state. He re-emerged a couple minutes later looking somewhat refreshed and carrying two steaming mugs of hot chocolate, topped with a sizeable mountain of whipped cream, studded with mini marshmallows.\n\n\"That Mrs Weasly is a queen among peasants\" Lavi trilled and he carefully made his way across the floor, trying not to spill the over-filled mugs. He handed one to Allen with a wide grin and settled down on the window seat, pulling the duvet up over his legs.\n\n\"Hey, thanks\" Allen said, scooping a finger-full of cream off the top and licking it with childish glee. Lavi's grin widened and he took a gulp of his own hot chocolate then leant forwards slightly\n\n\"Hey Allen\" He purred \"do you wanna marshmallow?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Allen grunted absent-mindedly, glancing back over. He gaped for a minute at Lavi who was flicking his eyebrows up and down suggestively balancing a couple marshmallows on the tip of his tongue. Allen suddenly realised that he was still gaping like an idiot and closed his mouth with a snap, then smirked and leant forward, placing a hand at either side of Lavi's waist. He closed the distance between the two so that nothing but a few millimetres separated their lips- he could feel Lavi's warm breath on his face. He gazed at Lavi's lips, then raised his grey eyes to meet Lavi's green one, then took a breath and said in a casual cheery tone\n\n\"No thanks, I'm fine!\" and sat back, taking a dignified sip of his own hot chocolate. Lavi inhaled sharply in surprise and chocked violently on the mini marshmallows as they tried to make their way down his windpipe. He jerked upright, the movement caused the hot chocolate to slop all over his arm and he yelped in pain. Allen could hardly splutter out an apology through his laughter and the apology he did manage to produce was somewhat unconvincing considering it was chocked out through tears of mirth\n\n\"You've ruined my jumper\" Lavi moaned leaping to his feet and shaking the hot liquid from his hands\n\n\"I'm really sorry\" Allen gulped, calming slightly\n\n\"Honest, I just...\" He sniggered again then regained control \"Seriously, sorry, you can borrow my spare. We really should go clothes shopping, this is getting a little ridiculous. Unfortunately what with all this research and strategising, we seem to have forgotten to attend to the practical things of life. Like getting more clothes than the ones we ran away in\"\n\nA very moody Lavi emerged from the dormitory a few minutes later, wearing one of Allen's white shirts, which was struggling to hold itself together- Lavi being somewhat more broad shouldered and muscular than Allen. He plonked down grumpily in the hanging basket chair in the centre of the room, spinning it around pointedly so its back was to Allen\n\n\"Aw come on Lavi\" Allen groaned, getting to his feet and padding over to the chair, trailing his duvet behind him like a miniature cape\n\n\"Don't be like that\"\n\nHe peaked around the edge of the basket but Lavi stubbornly turned his head the other way, pouting pointedly. Allen sighed and clambered into the egg shaped chair with him, sending it swinging gently like a pendulum. He tucked the duvet around both him and sat cross-legged patiently till Lavi stopped pouting and grudgingly made eye contact. Allen was pulling off his best puppy dog eyes, a very small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth\n\n\"Hey Lavi\" Hey said, in a voice which was full of suppressed laughter\n\n\"Do you want a marshmallow?\" He held one out between his thumb and forefinger, peering over the top, his eyes sparkling with mirth.\n\nLavi snorted and slapped his hand out of the way good naturedly\n\n\"Oh shut _up\" _He groaned, pulling Allen's duvet around his shoulders\n\n\"You are such a tease!\"\n\nAllen chuckled slightly, but his grin settled into a slightly more serious expression. They hadn't spoken about last night yet and he was worried about what Lavi was going to say next. They were in this pretty little bubble that he really didn't want burst with questions- especially not since the last couple days had been horrendous for him. He didn't want to have to think about what this was, or how he felt, or what to label himself as. He liked this- this kinship, this closeness. He didn't want to think about the potential implications\n\n\"So\" Lavi said and his tone told Allen that he was definitely not getting away with avoiding the topic\n\n\"Do you want to have sex?\"\n\nThe smile vanished from Allen's face instantly and his stomach clenched rather painfully. Lavi didn't look like he was joking, though his eyes weren't spiteful either. He seemed perfectly calm, like he was genuinely just curious\n\n\"I- wh- I don't- no! No I-\" Allen stuttered to a stop as his scrambled brain tried to fix word into a coherent sentence and his whirling feelings decided what they were.\n\n\"Is that what you thought...\"\n\nIndignant he thought as his words failed again. That was what he was feeling. Indignation. That was interesting. The pit of his stomach still felt like someone had dropped a rock in it and all the lightness that had been floating about mere minutes ago had evaporated\n\n\"Didn't you hear anything I said last night?\" He said, his pale cheeks flushed dark pink, anger started to bubble up\n\n\"Did you _miss _the part where I told you I really cared what happened to you and that you were important to me and... what... why would you...\" He left the question hanging- not really sure how to ask, or what he was even asking, so confused were his feelings and thoughts. Tears pricked at the back of his eyes and again he was confused as to why he was reacting this way.\n\nLavi too seemed confused by his response\n\n\"You kissed me, remember?\" I don't know how things work in your world but in mine, that is an action used to communicate interest in... well, sex. I didn't mean to upset you or anything dude... hang on actually, are you even gay? You dated that blonde chick before right? Are you bi? Or were you just being a...\" He trailed off, thankfully deciding not to finish that sentence but Allen had already gathered the implications and his eyes flashed with anger now instead of tears\n\n\"I _care _about you Lavi. I care properly about you. Like, the thought of you being hurt, or the thought of being away from you, it's just unimaginable... I _care._ I don't want to be... I don't want to cheapen... I'm not interested in this being...\" He clenched his fists, unable to vocalise his feelings fully\n\n\"I don't want to sleep with you, no. I want...\" He sighed deeply and with that exhale, his thoughts came through a bit more coherently\n\n\"I want intimacy- _genuine_ intimacy- you don't let people get close to you Lavi, and I don't let people get close to me either but you and me, we are so alike that we can see behind each others masks. We can see exactly how many barriers the other puts up and we know exactly how lonely each other's world is. Beyond that, I don't really know. I don't now if I am bi or gay or whatever. I haven't really got the time to figure that out between the whole end- of- the- world thing going on and the whole having- my- body- taken- over- by- a - Noah thing. I'm not interested in sex or anything I want to find a genuine bond with someone and I thought... I thought you maybe wanted that too but\" He shrugged one shoulder, suddenly choking on a lump in his throat. It was as if he hadn't really known what he wanted until he said that out loud and all of a sudden the reality of his emotions was hitting him. And hitting him hard\n\n\"But you obviously have something else in mind\" He finished, with difficulty. There was a long and painful silence as Lavi digested these words\n\n\"You know I can't give you that\" Lavi said gruffly \"I'm a bookman- I amn't supposed to get attached to the people I am recording, or just people in general- getting attached means losing perspective, losing clarity, bias... incomplete recordings. I can't get emotionally invested in anyone. You _know_ that\"\n\nAllen raised his eyes to meet Lavi's challengingly\n\n\"So you are going to tell me you don't care about me? That I am nothing but a piece in this battle that you happened to follow? Are you really going to sit there and tell me that you followed me here just to record my actions?\" The blazing silver eyes cut right through Lavi's heart and his words were cut off. Protests withered before they ever reached his lips and for the first time in his life, he was lost for words\n\nAllen stood up, dropping the blanket behind him\n\n\"Look Lavi, whether you want to admit it or not, you care. You care about me, and Lenalee and Kanda. And so does Bookman. He is breaking his own rules and do you want to know why? Because as superior as you two like to think you are, you are human too. And being human isn't always a weakness. It can be a strength too. Be _better_ Lavi- be human _and _be a Bookman. Record _and _care. Either do that, or stop caring altogether because this caring one moment and being completely distant the next? It's not fair.\" His tone softened slightly and he rested a hand on Lavi's shoulder\n\n\"Look, whatever you decide, I will always care about you and I will still consider you a friend but I need to know what you decide. My whole world is turning upside down around me, the ground is shifting beneath my very feet and I need to know what I can hold on to. Because if I decide to hold on to you, and you turn around and leave me? I won't make it and the Noah will win. So decide and get back to me when you have made up your mind, okay?\"\n\nHe turned before Lavi could respond and walked into the ark, trying not to catch his reflection in the glassy window pane as he passed but the solid black shadow of Neah drew his eye in and the grin mocked him even as he turned away.\n\n\nEnd file.\n",
